[('\nH.Solomon/The PhillipianJack Palfrey ’21 and Kai Charland ’21 both entered Andover as Juniors this year.\nJack Palfrey ’21 first moved to Andover six years ago when his father John Palfrey P’21 was named Head of School. He then, by default, became part of a specific group of students and children at Andover: the faculty kids. \n “My first friends here were faculty kids, and I still am close with many of them today. Even though we may be [at Andover for] different years, we still are very friendly with one another, and I am grateful to have been able to get to know so many of them,” he said. \nAs a faculty kid, Angel Cleare ’19 looked up to students that she met in dorms and on pathways.\xa0 “I remember there was this one girl named Auguste [White ’17] — she graduated last year — and I really looked up to her in seventh grade,” she said. \nCleare, however, said many students assume that her parentage significantly affected her chances for admissions. “People make a lot of jokes about faculty kids. Also, I remember when I applied here, people thought I just got in because of my mom was a teacher here, and not [because] of my application,” she said.\nKai Charland ’21 recalled his first memory interacting with “grown-up” high school students. \n“[As] I grew up going to [Paresky Commons], I just saw all the older people [and] all their big book bags. They looked pretty professional. I would wonder what it would be like to grow up and maybe be like them… [when I became a student],” Charland said.\xa0\nCurrent student faculty children have found that living on campus can have both advantages and logistical disadvantages, such as an awkward situation that Norman Walker ’20 described.\n“The situation is a bit strange because when all the day students leave, you’re here, and you’re not hanging out with the boarders past sign-in. I’m basically a day student that lives very near campus.” said Walker. \nHowever, not all of Andover’s faculty kids are part of the student body. Will Ware, nine; and Neily Ware, 11, say they appreciate how living on campus allows them to connect with a vibrant student culture. \n“So, me and my faculty-kid friends,\xa0 we like to be the ‘Junior Blue Keys,’ and so at Andover/Exeter, me and my friends go on the field with the Blue Keys and do cheers with them, and that’s a lot of fun,” Will Ware said. \nThe McQuades — Owen, seven; Ella, five; and Bridget, three — are also faculty children. Owen McQuade particularly enjoys attending performances put on by the Andover Department of Theatre and Dance. \n“…at [George Washington Hall] they usually have performances. I like those. The Grasshoppers,” said Owen McQuade.\n\n', 'Oct 28, 2017'), ('\nClick here\xa0to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease\xa0subscribe!\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nIn one of the small rooms off of the Unobskey Room in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), Paige Roberts, Director of Archives and Special Collections, surrounds herself with a flurry of loose-leaf papers and a potpourri of historical trinkets. Roberts has worked in the archives since 2012 and is a guide for curious students who want to explore Andover’s rich 240-year history.\nStudents are permitted to make appointments and view interesting artifacts in the Archives. However, the primary use of the Archives is for large projects and papers, according to Roberts.\nRoberts said, “Most of the student projects here have been big projects like CAMD student projects. I’ve had several Brace Fellows, some History-300 papers. Usually people come in because I’ve been working with teachers, and they bring a class in, and we do kind of a lesson, and during that I mention that you can do a history paper here.”\nEliot Min ’19 used the Archives in his English-200 class, researching memory books from students that were at Andover over 50 years ago.\nMin said, “I think it’s a very interesting place. What I enjoyed about getting to see Andover from the perspective of students from a very long time ago was just how it shed light on the evolution of Andover throughout the last 50 years. I thought that was really cool.”\nThe Archives contain a treasure trove of information spanning from administrative records of Abbot Academy and Andover, student scrapbooks and photo albums, to old vinyl records of rock bands on campus and videos created by art students that documented day-to-day life at Andover.\n“Special Collections is primarily older. In some cases, [it contains] rare books dating from the early years of the printing press — in 1450 all they way up to the twentieth century. For instance, we have a really great American humor collection, [and] we have a great collection of Dickens and Comrade,” said Roberts.\nBefore arriving at Andover, Roberts had an extensive background in history and archiving, starting out studying American Studies before returning to school to learn to manage archives and records.\nRoberts said the overall goal of the Archives is to provide context for students on the school they attend.\n“I think [the Archives] can really give them a broader sense of what it means to be a student here and how the school has changed over 235 years,” said Roberts.\nRoberts has worked with history teachers and incorporated lessons while the classes visited the archives. Emma Frey, Instructor in History, believes that access to the Archives is an important resource for students.\n“Students can benefit from the Archives as a repository of primary evidence to supplement any research about Andover or education in the United States. The Archives give Andover students the opportunity to interact with the rich history of the school and see how it connects the past to present. Working in the Archives also provides an experiential education to students and challenges them to think critically about material there without being told what to think by a textbook,” said Frey.\nThe Archives will be set for an upgrade once the OWHL undergoes renovations next summer. Storage space for the Archives will be allotted in the new basement, and the spaces will be climate controlled in order to better protect some of the aging artifacts. Roberts hopes that the renovation will make the Archives more attractive and the Special Collections more accessible to students.\nFrey said, “The Archives remind us that the school is not static. By using the documents there, we learn how Andover has changed and responded to events and ideas that are now part of history.”\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nCaroline Heldman, Chair of Political Science at Occidental College, believes that America is not yet ready to have a woman president. In her talk titled, “Are We Ready for a Woman in the White House,” in Kemper Auditorium last Wednesday, Heldman tied ideas of toxic masculinity and the objectification of women into the America’s current political climate and previous presidential elections.\nEmily Qian ’19 said,“I thought it was really interesting how she made it apparent that we are not ready for a woman in the White House yet. It was hard to hear that, but from the data she presented, it was obvious. The negative news coverage and coverage on appearance is so much higher when directed towards women than towards men. I think Dr. Heldman really opened my eyes to the sexism that is very much prevalent in politics and especially in the presidency.”\nHeldman based her claim on statistics about the media’s negative portrayal of women and how the image of an American president has evolved into a white man.\n“The moment that you think about a female candidate’s appearance — it damages her chances of electability. One study done by Heflick and Goldenberg after Sarah Palin’s run found that amongst Republicans, if you sexually objectify Sarah Palin…, it actually lowered your support for her as a candidate… She was sexually objectified by the press, and that gave people permission to not see her as being as legitimate of a candidate,” said Heldman in her presentation.\nIn one slide, she pointed out that female candidates generally receive less overall coverage, more overall negative reports, more talk about their families, less issue-based coverage, and lastly, more talk about their appearance. \nHeldman referenced Hillary Clinton in the recent presidential election and how the media shifted stories to comment more on Clinton’s personal life and capability as a female candidate.\nHeldman said that males are typically stereotyped to have more leadership qualities and are rated higher than girls in male-dominated employment opportunities. Additionally, Heldman says that there is a lack of support for female ambition and that females also often perceive themselves as less-qualified than men.\n“Men are seen as the default leaders, and women are rated more negatively for the same behaviors. Women are much more likely to be perceived as abrasive and receive negative performance reviews as a result,” she said. \nAllegra Stewart ’18 said, “I’ve always carried that idea with me, but never really known how it related to current times or how it really manifested in a female candidate. I think [the talk] brought up a lot of things that I’ve always kind of known but never really knew how to put together in terms of cohesive thought, so it was really powerful to link all the ideas that I had in terms of seeing empirical data and realizing that everything that I’ve speculated over the years turns out to have concrete evidence.”\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\n\nWith their project in aquaponics, Max Davis ’19 and Vivien Qiao ’19 are exploring environmentally-conscious agriculture.\nTerrence Xiao ’17, a recent Andover graduate, started the project during his Senior year as his Independent Project (IP) in biology. Davis and Qiao took on the responsibility after Xiao, who wanted the aquaponics system to continue at Andover after he graduated. Both having experience in aquaponics, Davis and Qiao took the opportunity to manage a project they are passionate about. \n“Aquaponics is basically a way to grow plants, like agriculture. Basically, Terrence wanted to make sure [his IP] is still being used to grow stuff and not just sitting there,” said Davis. \nDavis and Qiao are running the project mostly independently, with a couple of faculty members supporting them behind the scenes. Melanie Poulin, Biology Lab Assistant, and Leon Holley, Instructor and Chair in Biology, have been helping the pair throughout their progress. Poulin is a lab technician and helps them set up the labs and make sure the plants are in good shape.\nBoth students emphasized how environmentally friendly the system was. Unlike regular agriculture, aquaponics does not require any fertilizers or pesticides. It also conserves water, as the water cycles through fish before going back to the plants. Davis stated that some biology classes at Andover have used this system during their classes, for example, Biology-420, Animal Behavior. \n“It should be relevant because it saves a lot of water. It may not seem like that, but it actually uses 90 percent less water than regular agriculture,” Davis said. \nDavis explained the idea of aquaponics as hydroponics, but better. In hydroponics, plants are in a grow medium, usually gravel. During the process, water is circulated through the gravels, and plants receive their nutrients from what is in the water. This process requires adding nutrients to the water chemically. In aquaponics, however, the fish make the process easier, as the plants use the waste that the fish naturally create as nutrients. \nDavis and Qiao have been working together in the field of aquaponics since before they both came to Andover. \n“I think it started in middle school when we were in seventh grade and when we were maintaining our middle school’s greenhouse. Then we thought of the idea of doing an aquaponics project. We applied for grants, and in our eighth-grade year, we actually made the system. We really liked it, so we wanted to do it again,” said Qiao. \nDavis and Qiao both expressed their love of plants and animals, and aquaponics was something that contained both. The eco-friendliness brought the two together in creating an aquaponics project at their old school. According to them, however, their friendship goes beyond a shared interest. Davis explained that they have been friends since they started to work on projects together, and their enthusiasm for the subject allowed them to bond. As partners, they are both happy for the other’s presence on the team. \n“It’s been good to work together. It is nice to have a different opinion or view sometimes because we disagree on some things, and sometimes we fight. It’s okay because we always end up working it out, and we challenge each other in a way. We sort of motivate each other to do more, and we’re thinking of starting a new project. We want to do another aquaponics project, but that’s still [in] the works, so we don’t know yet,” Qiao said.\nQiao is looking ahead to what she hopes her and Davis’s work with aquaponics could become.\n“[Davis and I] really like aquaponics, and we hope to pursue our passion throughout life. We just see it as a more viable option and hope to see more people use it in the future,” Qiao said.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nAs a teenager, Noureddine El Alam, new Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, said goodbye to his family in Morocco and landed in New York City with only 600 dollars in his pocket and unable to speak English. Now, people who meet El Alam would be surprised to learn that English is not his first language.\n“When I came to America, I couldn’t speak [English]… But I spoke to strangers. I spoke to the homeless. I spoke with anybody who was willing to talk. If I’d stayed in my little bubble and was reserved, I would have stayed that way,” said El Alam.\nTyson Thomas ’19, a student of El Alam, said, “He always makes sure to add humor to his teachings. Mr. El Alam always teaches us the easiest way or method needed in order to solve the problem. If anyone in the class gets confused, he becomes the king of analogies, hoping that we can better understand what he’s saying, if we look at it from a different perspective.”\nGrowing up, El Alam spoke French and Arabic in Morocco, a country in North Africa that borders the Mediterranean Sea. There, he lived with his six siblings, his mother, and his father, a professor of Arabic literature. \n“[Morocco is] a lovely place. You get all of the climates. It’s very much like California, actually, in terms of size and population. The scenery is just beautiful. There’s a lot of history, culture, architecture, and the food is just top notch,” said El Alam.\nDespite his parents’ protests, El Alam left for the U.S. to begin his studies at City College on a student visa. While he had made money playing soccer back in Morocco, El Alam needed to find sources of income upon arriving in the U.S. Despite the restrictions of his student visa, El Alam worked various jobs to pay his expenses, including one at the United Nations as a translator. \n“I did a lot of odd jobs, and they pay you in cash. I was young, so I’d wait tables, I’d host, [and] I worked as a lifeguard. The school allowed you to work up to 12 hours a week, so I took advantage of that as well. I did a lot of tutoring at school. I probably did 20 jobs in a period of five years as I was doing my undergraduate studies in the city. It was difficult at times, and I had no support system, so I had to be creative,” said El Alam. \nAfter graduating college, El Alam fostered his love for teaching, serving as a teacher at Northfield Mount Hermon for six years. There, El Alam met his wife, Laura, and had two children. \nEl Alam and his family moved to California in 2000 and lived there for 17 years, where El Alam taught and coached soccer at Sage Hill School and Pacific Ridge School. This year, El Alam has returned to New England to teach math and coach Girls Varsity Soccer. \n“I’ve found people here to be extremely warm and supportive and nice. The community is strong, and students are awesome. I coach Girls Varsity Soccer here, and it’s just an amazing team. It’s like my second family. I know them so well — it’s as if I met them years ago,” said El Alam.\n“Whenever I arrive at practice or see him on the paths, he has this huge smile and goes ‘Maddy!’ and asks me about my day. In practice, he’s always willing to take me aside… if I ask or if he notices I need the work,” said Maddy Silveira ’20, a member of Girls Varsity Soccer. “He always wears his cleats so he can play with us, and he often jumps in on scrimmages when we need an extra player.” \nIn the future, El Alam hopes to teach multidisciplinary courses in order to expand upon his math background in other areas of learning.\n“I might work with the History Department and teach Islamic Studies, or maybe partner with the Religion and Philosophy departments and teach logic. And obviously, finance spans many disciplines like law, policy, math, and statistics as well. I just started, so I’m speaking with a lot of people because I’m very interested in teaching statistics that is service-learning based,” said El Alam.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nEcoAction, Andover’s environmentalism and sustainability club, attended a meeting with the Andover Green Advisory Board (AGAB) on Tuesday to discuss environmental projects in the Town of Andover. AGAB is an organization led by nine Andover citizens that advise the town on environmental policy. \nAGAB board member Melanie Cutler reached out to EcoAction to invite the club to the meeting. Georgia Ezell ’19, who has been a board member of EcoAction for the past two years, attended the meeting.\n“This is the first town meeting that we’ve been to… and we’re trying to do more off-campus events like this one and [get] involved in the surrounding communities,” said Ezell in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe focus of the meeting was a potential ban or tax on plastic bags to reduce waste in the town of Andover. Single-use plastic bags end up in landfills and the ocean and are not as environmentally friendly as recyclable paper bags.\nAGAB also addressed other courses of action the town can take to promote sustainability.\n“The reduction of paper usage across town hall, in general, is really interesting, converting everything to online PDFs. They’re working on decreasing waste by putting textile donation bins at all the local schools and by working with the students,” said Ezell.\nIn addition to the discussion of these proposals, AGAB also experienced some dissent from the audience when one citizen questioned the town’s responsibility to carry out environmental policies. This portion of the meeting resonated with Ezell.\n“Even though we might be better than our surrounding towns, or towns across the country, it is still our responsibility, and it’s not something that we can forget about,” said Ezell.\nEzell also described feeling inspired by the dedication of AGAB’s board members, a group from which she thinks Andover can learn something.\n“It was really inspirational to see this group of adults that were so passionate about environmentalism in [the town of] Andover and improving our sustainability as a town… [Andover], in particular, could use them as an example for a lot of projects because they’re very relevant to our campus as well,” said Ezell.\nEcoAction works closely with\xa0the Sustainability Office on campus to suggest and carry out environmental policy at Andover. The club does so in a number of ways, especially by informing the student body about living sustainably.\n“We host speakers. We host the Green Cup Challenge every year. We hold movie screenings and documentaries in order to educate the student body… [and] we do poster campaigns,” said Ezell.\nLooking toward the future, EcoAction hopes to contribute to a greedier Andover.\n“It’s important to remember that there’s always things that we can be working towards and always something that we can improve on,” said Ezell.\n“This year, we’re really hoping to reduce waste from [Paresky], specifically the cups, and [reduce] energy usage across campus, so I think our main focus for this year is waste,” Ezell added.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nThe new scheduling task force, led by Marcelle Doheny, Instructor in History and Social Science, has been meeting since last spring to form ideas for a new potential schedule. Following the rejection of the 4×5 schedule last year, with just 35 percent of faculty voters approving the schedule change, the task force hopes to implement a new schedule by the 2019-2020 academic year. \nAccording to Doheny, factors such as sleep, homework, and the pace of daily life are considered when the task force comes up with ideas for a schedule.\n“Our task is to work with the faculty to build consensus around a potential new schedule. This could involve some changes in the way we organize the calendar, but might not. The charge for the task force and the faculty is to be able to vote on a new schedule by the end of the spring term this school year. Plans would not go into effect until the 2019-2020 school year, however, thus giving us another year in which to fully work with any changes,” wrote Doheny in an email to The Phillipian.\nSo far this term, the task force has met weekly and has hosted a couple of full-faculty meetings. According to Doheny, they are in a “gathering of ideas” phase at the moment.\n“The impetus for change, as returning students know, began a couple of years ago and falls under the broader umbrella of strategic planning initiatives. Students and faculty had conversations around the strengths and weaknesses in our schedule and about the impact these have on our lives here,” wrote Doheny.\nMany students mention high stress levels and poor sleep habits during the week, causing the task force to contemplate the pros and cons of the current schedule.\n“This conversation is very complicated because we have a lot of moving pieces in a day, a week, and a term — hence the need to slowly gather ideas, then talk extensively about them prior to making any decisions,” Doheny wrote.\nSome students have expressed their wishes for small changes in the current schedule.\nSaniya Singh ’18 said, “I think that having all five classes on Friday is more stressful because then you have one night where you have to do homework for all of your classes.” \nSingh continued, “So, ideally, I think the current is honestly working fine, but if we had to change something, I would switch Monday and Friday. That way, you would have the weekend to do all of your classwork and have one day with all of your classes on Monday.” \nHosshini Suraj ’19 said, “I like the schedule right now because I personally can’t sit in a class for longer than forty-five minutes. I like shorter class periods where we’re more engaged during the class. I also like double periods once a week, just so that we’re able to do longer times, especially in a science class when you have a lab or in an English class where you’re continuing a discussion about a particular book… My only thing is lunch is pretty late on Wednesdays, and if I don’t get breakfast, I get pretty hungry.” \nSome students, on the other hand, are fine with the current schedule, and feel that there is no need for change.\n“Honestly, I’m totally happy with the way the schedule is now. I like how it kind of breaks each day down, like here’s my Monday, here’s my Tuesday, and then how in the middle of the week it slows down on Wednesday and Thursday. Then, on Friday, you finish with a bang. I think it’s perfect. I don’t think they should change it at all,” said Henry Crater ’20 in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Emma Tilghman ’20 agreed with Crater, saying, “I kind of like [the current schedule]. I like having the double periods because it means that teachers can cover more material, but it does depend on the classes.”\nLooking toward the future, the task force will work hard to piece together a schedule that will benefit students’ health while also supporting a rigorous curriculum.\nDoheny said, “We all learned a great deal from the conversations over the past two years and are all invested in building a consensus. Part of that will, of course, involve student input. We can certainly anticipate many spirited discussions this year.”\n\n Rachel Chang \n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\n“When a survivor comes forward, the very first thing that you say to them is, ‘I believe you.’ ”\nThis is the one idea Dr. Caroline Heldman, Chair of Political Science at Occidental College, hoped students would take away from her address on rape culture and sexual assault during Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM).\n“If you fit the popular box of masculinity or the popular box of femininity, then you are buying into normalized coercion. If you are raised in our culture and you are a heterosexual male, you’re taught to be what I call a pusher… If you are a girl or woman raised in our culture, you are raised to be a gatekeeper; you’re raised to be disinterested in sex,” said Heldman in her presentation.\nDr. Flavia Vidal, Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, and Carolina Artacho-Guerra, Instructor in Physics and a faculty member of the Brace Advisory Board, decided to bring Dr. Heldman onto campus as a way to continue teaching Andover students about healthy sexual relationships.\n“We [have been]… educating the community about rape culture and about toxic masculinity and\xa0 gender based violence and sexual assault for more than two years now… This is part of this ongoing effort to educate the community,” said Vidal.\nSome students were glad that the ASM shed light on sexual assault and appreciated that Dr. Heldman also reinforced previous learning in other programming such as the Personal and Community Education (PACE) and Empathy, Balance, and Inclusion (EBI) seminars with new statistics.\n“I thought the presentation added onto what we learned during last week’s ASM about toxic masculinity, unhealthy gender norms, and rape culture. Although we’ve gone over many of the core themes in dorm chats and during PACE and EBI, it was still shocking to see the horrifying statistics,” said Margot Hutchins ’20.\nAccording to Heldman, her motivation to research and speak about sexual assault and rape culture comes from personal experiences.\n“I have been an activist around this issue for two decades because it affected a lot of people in my life… Trying to get to the bottom of why it exists and why it’s so persistent and why we don’t talk about it became a big focus of my academic research,” said Heldman.\nIn addition, Heldman recently came forward as a victim of sexual harassment by Bill O’Reilly, and she has also offered support to a fellow victim and friend, Perquita Burgess.\n“I knew as a liberal commentator no one would believe me, and it would have ended my media career. I think, in retrospect, I was absolutely right. No one would have believed me,” said Heldman.\nHeldman continued, “I think there might be some pressure to shift the way women are treated in the entertainment industry [based on current allegations of sexual assault], but I also think that just having awareness of the issue equals accountability,.”\nDuring her talk, Heldman recognized that rape culture has also infiltrated Andover’s campus and is one of the factors responsible for giving rise to its hook-up culture.\n“The thing about hook-up culture is that men and women don’t like it. What we know is that men benefit from it reputationally but don’t like it emotionally. Women don’t benefit from it reputationally or emotionally. But students… engage in what’s called pluralistic ignorance, where they think, ‘Oh, I must be doing something wrong because everyone else likes it,’ ” said Heldman.\nIn terms of minimizing hook-up culture at Andover, Heldman had a few ideas. One was more communication during sexual intercourse.\n“Hookup culture leads to bad sex, and the best way to prevent that is to communicate a lot before, during, and after sex about pleasure, about consent. Consent actually leads to better sex. The more verbal communication you have during a sexual interaction, the more pleasure both parties will get from the sex,” said Heldman.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2017'), ('\nA group of students and faculty gathered at the foot of the Memorial Bell Tower on the morning of last Friday, October 6, waiting for Head of School John Palfrey to open its doors. As Palfrey released the lock, he stood and welcomed all those who came to climb the Bell Tower for a special view of campus. \nSara Parker, House Counselor in Stowe House, said, “There were a lot of students up there. It was a little crowded, but the views were pretty awesome. You could see the [Cochran] Chapel. You could see the [Gelb] Science Center and beyond. It was beautiful… I didn’t know if I would ever be able to go up there again so I was really glad that I got to.”\nWith many students off campus for the four-day weekend, Palfrey announced the event via email Thursday evening. Palfrey’s invitation reached out to all grades, inviting them to participate in what has long been a Senior class tradition. \xa0\nAccording to Max Rigby-Hall ’18, a group of Seniors led the charge to the top of the Bell Tower up the several flights of stairs. Through its four windows, the Bell Tower offered community members views of the fall foliage, the Quads, and Main Street. Current Seniors added their names in marker to a wall already covered in signatures from previous Senior classmen. \nIn the past, few people could say that they have looked down on campus from the Bell Tower before Senior year. Going to the top of the Bell Tower has traditionally been exclusively for Seniors in their Spring Term. As a popular item on many students’ Andover bucket lists, many students wish to climb to the top to experience this Andover tradition before graduation. \nThis time, however, non-Seniors such as Claire Brady ’20 decided to go to check a box off her bucket list even before her Senior Spring.\nBrady said, “Going to the top of the Bell Tower had always been on my bucket list for Andover. And when Mr. Palfrey let everyone know that it was open I thought it would just be a great time to go up while I could because I didn’t know when I would get another chance to do it.” \nRigby-Hall shared a similar thought in wanting to complete the activity. In the beginning of the year, he and his advising peers had written their Senior bucket lists. Rigby-Hall said that he had two final tasks left, one of which was going to Holt Hill, while the other was going to the top of the Bell Tower. Knowing that his Spring will be busy, Rigby-Hall decided to complete one of these final tasks on Friday.\nWhile Ora Cullen ’19 anticipated her climb up the Bell Tower, she said that she felt strange doing an activity that is usually reserved for Seniors. Nevertheless, she said that this experience has given her deeper respect and appreciation for those who ring the tower’s bells. \xa0\nCullen said “It felt really weird. It felt kind of like cheating because you’re only supposed to do this senior spring when you’re about to graduate.” \nRigby-Hall said that although he was initially surprised when seeing a non-Senior friend at the Bell Tower, he felt that it was an appropriate gesture to include all grades. \nRigby-Hall said “At first I was a little annoyed because this was sort of the Senior’s thing and the underclassmen can do it in the following years. But… I think this time [the event was]… less about senior bucket lists and more about the mood on campus. [It was] something fun to do for anyone who was still around because so many people went home, so I don’t think there was any harm in bringing the underclassmen at all.”\nWhile Palfrey did extend this invitation earlier in the year, he still plans to organize this event again for the Seniors in the Spring as usual. \n\n', 'Oct 24, 2017'), ('\nClick here\xa0to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease\xa0subscribe!\n\n', 'Oct 20, 2017'), ('\nClick here\xa0to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease\xa0subscribe!\n\n', 'Oct 13, 2017'), ('\nS.AlShaiba/The Phillipian\nSix student panelists shared their experiences with the Tang Institute’s Learning in the World (LITW) program at Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM).

For example, on a church the bottom half would be Inca architecture and then the top half would be Spanish architecture, and I thought that it was pretty symbolic of culture being erased by [Spanish] conquest.”\nRobinson, who went on the South Africa and Arts trip, said, “I think one of the biggest things I brought back is the new sense and idea of what a community means. I learned so much about being with each other and feeding off of each other and loving each other. I learned to cherish the community that we are in and the community that I traveled with, so just what community means really changed a lot of me.”\nYeetang Kwok ’20 said that the ASM made him realize how students can benefit in different ways from the program.\nKwok said, “I was intrigued by how the program was not just about learning another language or another culture but that it [also] taught many other skills as well. One example I really liked was the aspect of building a community through the program that some of the students on stage mentioned.” \nItzelt Reyes ’19 said she was moved by an activity at the beginning of ASM when Muñoz-Fernández asked students who were born in or had spent significant time in areas outside the United States to stand up.\n“Regarding the actual presentation, it is truly beautiful how curious and yearning the [LITW] participants were.

Zogby, Ph.D., was inspired to give voice to those unheard. While researching his doctoral dissertation in Lebanon, Zogby visited a refugee camp, listening to the stories of numerous individuals. It was this moment in which Zogby was inspired to not only change the direction of his life, but also to embark on his life’s efforts to empower the marginalized.\n“An old woman came up to me… and she said, ‘We told you everything about us, what are you going to do with us?’ And it was sort of a challenge, and I said to myself, ‘If you really listen to people, we have a responsibility to do something for them.’ That one experience with that lady haunted me to have to do something — to change the direction of my life,” said Zogby.\nToday, Zogby serves as the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, a leadership organization which encourages Arab-American empowerment. Zogby also serves as a member of the Executive Committee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), among other positions in the DNC. In addition to his many positions, Zogby was appointed by President Barack Obama to the U.S. Commission of National Religious Freedom twice in 2013 and 2015. \xa0\nOn Friday night in Kemper Auditorium, Zogby spoke to the Andover community on the stereotypes and realities of the Arab world. In his talk, Zogby emphasized the importance of communication and expression for people in both the Middle East and United States. \nZogby opened up his talk by explaining his earlier involvement with the civil rights and antiwar movements in the U.S. While participating in these movements, Zogby began to connect ongoing movements in other areas of the world to the Middle East, realizing that these initiatives could transform the way people were fighting for change in the Middle East.\n“I grew up in the civil rights anti-war movement and I was of Arab descent so I had an affinity but not an engagement in that region. But at some point, I remembered [that] the issues that brought me into the antiwar movement and the civil rights movement should be applied to the Middle East too. [In] Lebanon… I remember people saying, ‘Why doesn’t someone do for us what they’re doing for the war in Vietnam’— to stop it, and to stop the Israeli occupation,” said Zogby.\nAs co-head of the Middle Eastern Student Association, Sami El Solh ’18 was responsible for inviting Zogby to speak before the Andover community. In his introduction of Zogby, El Solh explained his reasons for wanting Zogby to present and give a voice to Arab-Americans as a whole.\n“Today, for Arab-Americans like myself and many others on campus and across the States, it is so important to bring an influential figure like Dr. Zogby to be the voice of the Arab-American population amidst so many negative perceptions and stereotypes towards us today,” said El Solh.\nAnother board member of the Middle Eastern Student Association, Shahinda Bahnasy ’20, felt that Zogby’s presentation impacted her own understanding of her culture and her identity in the context of the modern world.\nBahnasy said, “I was so excited to meet him that when I shook his hand, I got goosebumps. His speech, his persona, and his strong name all made me rethink my culture. Dr. Zogby’s speech allowed me to better understand the relationship between my family’s culture and my culture, and its role in this day in age. It also truly hit home when Dr. Zogby referred to Arab terms with an Arabic accent.” \n\n', 'Oct 5, 2017'), ('\nRather than throwing out unneeded items and clothing at the end of the school year, many students take advantage of Green Move Out pods, which serve as sustainable alternatives to waste disposal. The pods are open for students to both take and drop off goods, creating a sharing economy in which many parties can benefit.\nThese pods play a major role in Andover’s Green Move Out program — a program with the ultimate goal of reducing waste.\nAllison Guerette, Andover’s Campus Sustainability Coordinator, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “The Green Move Out reduces Phillips Academy’s waste stream. Donating items that have not yet reached the end of their useful life diverts waste from landfills and waste-to-energy facilities, both of which emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.”\nDuring Green Move Out, a shipping container is placed in each cluster with three separate bins: books, hard goods, and soft goods. Hard goods include items such as small furniture, fans, and lights. Soft goods include clothing, bedding, and towels. Although the program has been through several different iterations, its main goal has always been to reduce waste.\nAfter students have had the opportunity to donate or take available items in the pods, the remaining material is donated to Goodwill’s LifeWorks Community Support Services Program, a program that provides community support services to disabled individuals. According to Guerette, 7.8 tons of material were donated to this program in 2017. \n“This is a more green alternative to recycling because you’re actually able to give it back to the community and have those clothes donated to a certain cause… I also think that as far as making our earth a better planet and using all of our natural resources and reusing the ones that we already have and not being a wasteful, narcissistic society that we’ve evolved into [is important]… making sure that we’re using resources to the fullest of their ability,” said Daniel James ’18.\nStudents appreciate that the Green Move Out pods offer the opportunity to pass on unneeded accessories as well as to acquire room decorations and clothes for the next year without having to buy new items. Reusing school supplies and clothes reduces the demand for new products every year. The lowered demand of supplies also reduces the market for new products, as companies cut down on the production of excess materials and usage of natural resources.\nElena Vinton ’19 said, “I’ve definitely left a lot of my old clothes there that no longer fit but are still in good shape, and I know that a lot of my clothes are also things that I found there… I think that when something loses value to you, you tend to just throw it away without considering the fact that it will be valuable to someone else. I found a chair in the pods, and I’m sure for someone else they couldn’t bring it with them or they didn’t want it anymore, but for me and my roommate, we found it, and so we kept it, and it’s awesome.”\nThe Campus Sustainability Office raises awareness about the Green Move Out every year through emails, signs, and announcements, but some students feel that the student body still lacks knowledge about what the program is and how it works. As a result, not all students may be able to take advantage of the opportunities the program provides.\n“When I look at the green pods and what’s in it, it definitely doesn’t reflect [all of the boarding] students… wasted material,” said James.\nSome students who make use of the Green Move Out bins remain unaware that they can take things out of the pods for themselves as well. Isabella Morona ’19 thinks that greater communication and explanation of the program in dorms every year would lead to more overall awareness and more students using the pods.\n“I think that house counselors and proctors should give an explanation at the end of the year about what green move out is and how it basically works because I know that I wasn’t told that you could take things out, only that you could sort of donate,” said Morona.\nThe amount of material that is donated every year goes to an environmental cause, but it is not the only way in which Andover students can contribute. Guerette thinks that one thing students can improve to reduce their waste over the course of the year is to remain mindful of how much they are contributing to consumerism.\nGuerette said, “The Green Move Out demonstrates how much stuff we acquire over the course of a year, and it offers a chance for more thoughtful consumption in the future.”\n\n', 'Oct 5, 2017'), ('\nAfter category four hurricanes Harvey and Irma bulldozed a path of destruction, Leo Brother ’18 and Sydney Olney ’18 raised nearly 1,000 dollars for the United Way Hurricane Relief Fund. According to United Way official website, the nationwide recovery fund gives agency to the communities who receive the money.\n“We picked UW because the fund isn’t focused on one specific resource, rather it puts the money into the communities so that those affected can decide what they need and how the money should be spent,” wrote Brother in an email to The Phillipian.\nBrother and Olney set up a table at Paresky Commons last week to accept donations for the victims of natural disasters. Both found inspiration in Andover’s motto, Non Sibi. \n“I’m from New York, so I went through Hurricane Sandy. I was not hit very badly. The worse I had was no power for two weeks. But there were two boys in our district who were killed by a falling tree. So those two deaths were multiplied several times in the casualties of Hurricane Irma inside and outside of their impact of the U.S., so it just really felt necessary for me to reach out,” said Olney.\nBrother spent a week worrying whether or not his grandparents in Naples, Florida would lose their house as a result of Hurricane Irma.\n“I saw the devastation that happened in Houston [and] around the time we saw Hurricane Irma heading for the west coast of Florida. I started to panic… that people who were really important in my life had a chance of losing everything they had. I realized there was a need for action, [so] I rallied around that [idea] and got the community involved,” Brother said in an interview with The Phillipian.\nIn early September, Brother put an announcement on the Senior class Facebook page asking if anyone else was interested in starting a Hurricane Relief Fund. This post caught Olney’s attention. \n“I had already been researching the idea by myself for the past few weeks so [Leo’s post] was really perfectly timed,” said Olney. “We worked with Mr. Capano, who gave us resources necessary to carry out a fundraiser, and he got us everything that we needed to set up. We also talked to Ms. Scofield to get a Blue Card scanner because we knew not a lot of people would be carrying around cash.”\nChristopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, said, “I think it is great that [Brother and Olney] think outside of just the Andover community and are trying to help out the larger world. The last few hurricanes have been horrible tragedies for different countries and states and the fact that they were thinking of a way [to make] that a little better is fantastic.”\nAll donations will be sent to the United Way, an organization that “fights for the health, education, and financial stability of every person in every community,” according their official website. Although a national organization, United Way aims to act in local communities through various projects and partners. \n“A lot of people across the country are going through the Red Cross because it’s more universal, but what we heard from people in our grade who live in the area and other sources that the Red Cross is one of the more inefficient charities… meaning that a lot of the money that gets donated does not actually end up where it needs to be,” said Brother.\nBrother continued, “[With the United Way], we can put all the money in one place, and it will get divided up equally between different United Way branches in Houston, the coast of Florida and the Keys, and the places that need it most. [It’s] in a more local setting where the people have more say in where the money goes.”\nSome money from Sunday’s Quad Day was also added to the overall donation.\n“I’ve never been involved in any sort of collection of this level, but we’ve come close now to raising about 1,000 dollars and we’re going to get hopefully more,” said Brother. “We are also talking with the cluster councils in Flagstaff and Pine Knoll because the admissions from the Halloween dance every fall gets donated to some charity. We’re hoping that we can get those funds to go into our United Way fund before we get that donated.”\nOlney said, “Andover is a community that is very wealthy. So knowing that we didn’t have a fund going on when so many of us have so much to give, it felt wrong in a way, especially because our school motto is Non Sibi. What is more Non Sibi than helping those who seriously [need] that help.”\n\n', 'Oct 5, 2017'), ('\nTo honor this school year’s theme of “Citizenship,” each week The Phillipian will feature an international student at Andover and detail their experiences as participants in multiple national cultures. This series will aim to highlight the diversity of Andover’s community and explore the lives of its various global citizens. \nAlthough many people mistakenly assume she is from Somalia, Zakeiya Yusuf ’21 is proud to introduce herself as from the Republic of Somaliland. With a flight route that found her landing in Dubai and Ethiopia, Yusuf embarked on her first journey to the United States to attend Andover’s ACE-9 summer program on a Visitor Visa. After obtaining her F1 Student Visa, Yusuf was finally able to matriculate as a Junior at Andover. \n“She had to go to Dubai, and from Dubai to here, [which] is like a two and a half day trip,” said Susanne Torabi, International Student and Academy Travel Coordinator. “And she did that twice, because we had to make her go back after she ended the summer session program to come in on her F1 Visa.”\nYusuf learned about boarding schools in the U.S. from Sami Atif, \xa0Instructor in \xa0Mathematics at Phillips Exeter Academy, who visited her former school near Somaliland’s capital, Hargeisa. Drawn to Andover’s multicultural student body and free dress code, Yusuf decided to apply.\n“I came this summer for summer session, and that was the first time I came [to the U.S.],” she said. “A lot of people [at Somaliland] immigrate to Europe, especially teenagers, but it’s sad because a lot of them die on the way to get to Italy… America is like this great place that they would do a lot to go to.”\nSomaliland gained independence in May 1991 following the overthrow of President Siad Barre and the collapse of the Somali government. Though unrecognized internationally, Somaliland has its own government, elections, and currency independent of Somali, and boasts a population estimated at about 3.5 million people, according to the BBC. \n“One of the most important things that I want people to know is that [Somaliland is] different [from] Somalia. Because when people hear my country, I feel like they don’t hear it… it’s like they just assume I said Somalia,” said Yusuf.\n“I would like [people] to know that it’s peaceful because once they hear Somaliland, they think it’s Somalia, and then they relate it to sea pirates… I don’t blame them because they probably don’t know, but I would like them to know that it’s actually quite peaceful and quite different.” \nAlthough Somaliland is a self-declared autonomous state, it is still officially recognized as a part of Somalia. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order “Travel Ban,” which includes Somaliland, Yusuf will continue to face challenges regarding her stay at Andover. \n“What will happen at the end of the year? Will it be safe for her to travel back home?.. Those questions most of our students don’t have, but she is faced with that, and she will need support,” said Torabi. “It is my hope that someone on an F1 Visa student will be beared from restrictions, but extra screening and all that will clearly be part of her journey, and that raises anxiety.” \nAt Andover, Yusuf has had difficulty adhering to Muslim prayer rules due to the lack of an Adhan, the Islamic call to worship. Back home, Yusuf heard this call multiple times a day. \n“There’s no Adhan… so sometimes it’s easy for me to forget to pray, which I haven’t done in quite a while. I feel bad that [praying] slips out of my mind when I don’t hear the Adhan,” said Yusuf. \nIn her time outside of school, Yusuf plans to stay with either her host family or older sister, who currently attends university in New York. \n“I miss my little brother very much, and it’s kind of sad because I’m gonna miss seeing him grow up and all… I’m gonna miss my friends and the food too. It’s very different from here, especially the rice,” said Yusuf. \xa0\n“Even though there are things that I would like to do during summer here at Andover, I think I still need to go back and see my family and friends.”\n\xa0\nYusuf hopes to pursue her passion for astronomy, dance, and guitar at Andover. \n“I’m thinking about becoming an astronomer when I grow up, and I want to make the first space organization back at my home,” said Yusuf. “I’m also interested in dancing [so] I auditioned for Hypnotiq and I made it.” \nShe looks forward to experiencing different elements of American culture.\n“I’m doing instructional swimming now. It’s challenging, but it’s fun too. I tried swimming across the pool today, and I actually did it… I really like the malls here…They are very different from back home. I haven’t gone to the cinema yet, but I’m very excited to do that.

As a chess master, Yip is one of the top 99 percentile of chess players in the world.\n“I was pretty excited [to become a chess master]… and after beating [Williams], I also got a ton of money, so then I was really excited about going to the bookstore and getting books and stuff.

She plans to join the chess club and one of her main goals would be to break the record to be the youngest female international master, the next step after a chess master, as a 14-year-old.\n“After [chess master], there’s an international master level, and then there’s grandmaster level. There are these things called Norms. You have to play in a certain tournament against people who aren’t [from] the U.S.… they all have to be international masters already.

Every night, Yip would play with her father until she started winning against him six months later. She now trains under Denys Shmelov and Skypes with her other coach, Andriy Vovk, who is from Ukraine. Yip also used chess books and computer programs to improve.\n“[I like chess] pretty much just [because of ] the fact that I’m good at it… It’s pretty interesting at first, and it sort of drew me in.

By spending time with the chick, providing it with\nwarmth, and coaching it to respond to a red cloth tied around the student’s wrists or ankles, students can teach their new pets to follow along by their sides and answer to calls.\nThomas Glover ’18 said, “[Imprinting is] an innate behavior that most birds, mainly chickens and ducks, that aren’t born in a nest, have. The chickens can imprint on really anything, but they prefer things that are red, things that move, or things that look like birds. So in the wild, the combination of all three is their mother.”\nBrought to Gelb as eggs, the chicks were incubated until they hatched early last week. Each student in the class got their own bird, and induced imprinting using their body heat and the sound of their own voice.\nAlthough the imprinting activity had been done in years prior by Thomas Cone, retired Instructor in Biology, he had stopped since he had nowhere to send the chicks after the imprinting activity was conducted.\n“Though he no doubt taught about imprinting each year, Mr. Cone ran out of places to send chicks at the end of the unit and therefore didn’t feel it was ethical to get them without knowing where they would go afterwards,” said Bailey.\nThis year, however, Bailey contacted Stephanie Cormier, Student Program Coordinator, who agreed to take the chicks to her farm after the experiment, thus allowing for the imprinting experiment to be conducted.\nA.Macaya/The PhillipianThe chicks will live on Stephanie Cormier’s farm following the experiment.\n“Since Ms. Cormier was willing to house the chicks on her farm after the class finished with them, I decided that bringing back, and even expanding, this work with live chicks seemed like a really good fit for my vision for the course,” said Bailey.\nUnfortunately, there have been incidents of chicks passing away. After a power outage in Gelb while the eggs were still incubating, the humidity dropped very low in the incubator. The chicks were already partially hatched during this time, causing the exposed membrane to dry up. According to students interviewed by The Phillipian, two chicks did not hatch as a result of the outage.\nThe first 36 hours after hatching are a critical time for the chicks — after this period, the birds switch from innate imprinting to associative learning and will not be able to imprint on their “mother.” According to students, another factor that facilitates the imprinting process is being rough and showing tough love to the chicks.\nMacey Mannion ’19 said, “If we spent enough time with it alone, it started following us when we walked around. The longer the distance you walk with the chick, the stronger it imprints on you… I’m the soccer manager, so I brought him to practice and was bringing him around the track, and just playing with him.”\nNate Cruz ’18 said, “We were actually told that if you accidentally kick your chick, it’s actually better, because their moms are not easy on them. Their moms hit them and nudge them, and she will keep going and the chick just has to follow. So the pain actually strengthens the imprinting.”\nThe chicks were kept in shoeboxes, which were equipped for keeping the chick warm and comfortable. Although the chicks were in the classroom during the day, students had the chicks sleep in the dorm with them in order to spend as much time with it\nas possible.\nCruz said, “One thing I did to help the imprinting was when I was in my room, I just held the chick and let it sleep with me.”\nGlover said, “I kept my chick in my closet, which may seem like I was just trying to get it to be quiet, but it was actually a lot warmer and darker in there. The chick was able to sleep better that way, and so it was less noisy.”\nAll of the chicks have been named by their students. Glover’s is named Jim, Cruz’s is Frank, and Mannion’s is Chester.\n“It’s been fun, but very distracting. He doesn’t stop chirping anytime, especially when I put him in his box, so it’s a little distracting when I’m trying to get other work done,” said Mannion.\nIn an e-mail to The Phillipian, Bailey said, “This activity also allows students who may never have interacted closely with animals (beyond dogs and cats), the opportunity to form a connection with a living creature, learn how to meet its needs, and experience the excitement (and occasional frustration) of working with an unfamiliar animal.”\n\n', 'Sep 22, 2017'), ('\nRows of white tables and chairs scattered the Great Lawn last Saturday as students, faculty, and alumni enjoyed lobster rolls, shrimp and avocado shooters, and house-made whoopie pies under the clear blue skies.

When I initially entered the cage on Friday, they had dressed it all up, made it look very fancy. It was pretty crazy because you walk in and it’s carpeted and beautiful. It’s a really weird feeling.

The community picnic and gala were part of the larger campaign to fundraise 400 million dollars to support Andover’s need blind admissions program and campus master plan.\nTracy Sweet, Director of Communications, said, “You’ve heard a lot about our work in Equity and Inclusion, and Empathy and Balance and Creativity and Innovation, so a lot of the strategic planning was really supporting how we continue to invest in the school… There was [also] a commitment to supporting our need blind admissions program and really standing for our school’s commitment to Youth From Every Quarter… The second piece is [the] campus master effort to think about the physical campus and our needs over the next decades, not just in the shorter term.”\nThe “quiet phase” of the campaign, which started in 2015, has already raised 140 million dollars. This first phase was aimed to raise early gifts and test campaign ideas with the board and other lead donors. The second “public phase” will continue until 2022 and attempt to raise 260 million dollars in order to reach the final 400 million dollar goal. Head of School John Palfrey P’21 has partnered with the campaign co-chairs Currie, Joseph Bae ’90, and Amy Falls ’82, P’19, P’21, and the rest of the board of trustees to set the strategy and agenda of the campaign.\nThe seven-year campaign directly affects present-day students and faculty at Andover, as well.\n“The campaign has already affected students in lots of ways. [It] has already raised 140 million dollars, so that money is already at work… The biggest single piece is always financial aid in Andover’s efforts in terms of fundraising. The reason is to sustain need-blind admissions… The financial sustainability of need-blind is a really big question always… I think [remaining a need-blind institution] is the most important in terms of setting Andover apart,” said Palfrey.\n“It is about bringing in the most extraordinary students… regardless of what they can pay. Locking in the next generation of need-blind is what I’m most excited about,” he continued.\nThomas Lockerby, Secretary of the Academy, said, “On the other side, we’re really thinking lots of investments in the areas of faculty innovations. The Tang Institute… can have the opportunity to create new courses and think about new ways of teaching… We’ll be thinking about wellness and mindfulness, so those are really tangible ways that both our two most important human populations, our students and our faculty, will really benefit from directly.”\nAdditionally, the Snyder Center will open in December and there are plans to renovate the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library in the future.\nLockerby continued, “We actually hope that most of the campaign actually is really felt by our students and our faculty, that it doesn’t feel invisible, that there are real things happening that directly affect your life literally each and every day.”\nEvents similar to the community picnic are also being planned for the future.\n“We do think that a way to bring the community together, especially with students and faculty with outside guests, is, first of all, fun. But it’s also inspiring for our outside guests to meet students and for faculty to see the fact that alumni and parents are really interested in their world,” said Lockerby.\n“We really want students to know that the investments that people are making are really about them, and we want our faculty to know the same thing. It’s really about them. Our job is to make it possible for you to have a great education, that’s why we exist.”\nThe Andover campaign will rely on mostly individual alumni and parent donors, in addition to crowdfunding, email, and social media techniques. According to Lockerby, peer to peer fundraising plays a significant role for the campaign. Peer to peer fundraising involves volunteers from around the world who participate in the campaign to ask their parents or, in case of alumni, ask their classmates to support the school.\n“They’re almost like philanthropic ambassadors… that care deeply about Andover [and] its mission. They feel great pride in the school so they absolutely step up in numerous ways. Or when you’re fundraising just year over year, the compounding effect that they can have can be truly tremendous,” said Sweet.\nThe campaign title, Knowledge and Goodness, was chosen to be emotionally evocative and grounded in the school, according to Lockerby.\n“[The campaign name] comes from… the founding document of the school when the Phillips family established it 240 years ago… Knowledge without goodness is evil, and goodness without knowledge is weak and feeble… Andover combines the two… Everything that goes on here is about providing you access to knowledge and providing for you the ability to develop within yourself the best Non Sibi spirit.

It also means the trainers are getting out of here at 8:30,” said Modeste.\n“We’ll take intramurals for basketball and put them in the new facility… so then these folks could start and hour earlier and we could alleviate some of the problems on the basketball court,” he continued.\nTrack runner Abhinav Tadikonda ’20 is especially excited for the new track facility in the Snyder center because he says the location of last year’s winter indoor track was not suitable for sports events.\n “The indoor track is a very small space, so a lot of the events overlapped… For example the 50 meter dash overlapped the 150 meter races so you couldn’t do more than a couple events at a time which made it pretty inconvenient because it extended the overall time of the meet itself,” said Tadikonda.\nCurrently expected to have a soft opening after Thanksgiving break and a final opening in February, the Snyder Center will house 12 new squash courts, a 200 meter track, and three glass multipurpose rooms. \n\n', 'Sep 15, 2017'), ('\nStudents, beware: two cuts is now the maximum amount a student can have without consequences. The Blue Book underwent revisions over the summer, and new policies, made with a more severe approach, are implemented to stress the importance of attendance during school-related activities. Previously, poor attendance was considered a major offense and often resulted in probation.\nDean of Students and Residential Life, Jennifer Elliott ’94 said, “We want to improve student independence. We want students to be going to all of their engagements, whether that’s their classes, their work duty, their advising meetings, their extracurricular commitments, we just want to give students every reason to attend their commitments.”\nStudents with three to five unexcused absences will meet with their point person or attend mandatory weekend study hall. Six to 15 unexcused absences will result in Student Reflection and a Core Team/Full Team Response. 16-plus unexcused absences will cause a Full Team Response or Student Program Review Committee (SPRC) Review.\n“We have outlined a list of consequences for major absentees where a student will have a series of core team responses, a full team response, and ultimately a full-team meeting,” said Elliott.\nThe core team includes the student’s cluster dean, primary house counselor/day student advisor, and if the student boards, their advisor. The full team includes the core team, all current instructors in academic courses, coaches, and supervisors. Their job is to assist the student with time management, a healthier sleep schedule, and attend to obstacles a student may have getting to class.\n“I feel like the two cuts system is a good way to help people make sure that they’re getting caught up with classes and making sure that they’re responsible for their own education because it’s boarding school. I’m a supporter of it because I think it will really help people just keep up with their classwork, take care of themselves, and be responsible academically,” said Jen Lu ‘19.\nMultiple terms of unexcused absences and failure to follow the expectations could result in expulsion from the school or a required leave of absence. If a Senior has ten or more unexcused absences during spring term, then the student will receive his or her diploma late and will likely be excluded from Commencement activities including prom.\nAccording to Elliott, commitment is an essential element, and attending activities is a fundamental reason for being at Andover. She wants to make sure students are going to class and that even when they are not in a learning environment, they are still engaged with their surroundings.\n“We want to include parents or families in that conversation to help motivate kids to get to class, and be part of the conversation when kids are struggling. When they’re having a hard time in a class, we want to be sure that the adults around them are supporting them,” said Elliott. \n“Let’s say, for example, for a whole week I had a lot of work, and on a Friday, my body decided that it needed some empathy and balance and decided to sleep through two classes. Having the two cut system makes the repercussions for sleeping a little longer a lot worse than it was before,” said Vish Dhar ‘19.\n“I don’t think it really helps with administering punishments or anything like that, you’re just going to get a lot more people cutting. You’re going to have to be giving a lot of restrictions for overcutting, so I don’t think it’s helping anyone,” continued Dhar.\nThe “Attendances and Absences” section is highlighted on pages 54-56 of the Blue Book, where the rules explicitly state that students accumulating unexcused absences will receive disciplinary action.\nChanges in the Blue Book are not uncommon, according to Elliott. The aim of the Blue Book is to outline the expectation for students and to make rules clear.\n“Every year we revise the Blue Book. That’s our practice, and that’s been our practice forever. Truthfully, every time it goes to print, there’s always something that we think ‘Hm… maybe we could explain that more clearly, maybe that’s something that we should do better or differently,’ ” said Elliott. \nIn terms of ideas for the future, Elliott suspects that there will be revisions in room visiting policies to make Andover more gender-inclusive.\nElliott said, “Thinking about the binary nature of our room visiting policies right now, and a lot of the hetero-normative assumptions that are made when thinking about our room visiting practices and policies. And so we’re trying to think about how we can craft a policy that is more in line with our values and our community expectations.”\n\n', 'Sep 15, 2017'), ('\nR.Prem/The PhillipianBlue Key Heads lead the procession of Seniors as they march into first ASM of 2017-2018.\nBeginning this term, Underclassmen and Uppers from each cluster will take turns watching a livestream of All-School Meeting (ASM) in Kemper Auditorium due to lack of space in Cochran Chapel, according Dean of Students and Residential Life Jennifer Elliott ’94. Seniors will continue to observe ASM from the Chapel pews. \n“I think [space restrictions] mean we miss out on opportunities for students to engage in really rich conversations with faculty members [and] to process … what the meeting was about,” said Elliott. \n“If it’s going to be an All School Meeting, we’d love there to be as many community members as possible engaging.”\nCluster Deans have routinely expressed concerns regarding students’ inattentive behavior during ASM, and although the revision has not yet been added to the Blue Book, Elliott hopes the change will encourage students to stay engaged. \n“[The Cluster Deans] feel that students would have their phones away, wouldn’t be studying, wouldn’t be sleeping… if there were more faculty members,” she said. “Fundamentally, our kids are really respectful folks, so often all it takes is an adult nearby to remind them how important it is to listen respectfully in that space.”\nMargot Hutchins ’20 said, “The whole point of an ASM is to bring the whole student body together. By separating clusters into [two separate rooms], the new ASM defeats the purpose.”\nHutchins proposed adding chairs in the aisles or allowing students to seat up by the organ chamber. “Seeing someone first-hand is a very different experience from viewing someone speak [through] a webcam.

Organized by Out of the Blue (OOTB), the “blackout” sought to raise awareness and unite the school community against President Trump’s proposed repeal, according to the Junah Jang ’20, a board member of OOTB. \n“Even though a large majority of people have heard about DACA, they might not know what it stands for, who it affects, and the disadvantages of repealing it … Seeing that huge presence of black shirts and black pants all across the SamPhil stairs, [we all] look like a block of color and a really unified group,” said Jang.\nEstablished by the Obama administration in 2012, DACA grants 800,000 immigrants — who entered the nation illegally before age 16 — permission to live, study, and work in the United States for a two-year period, according to “The New York Times.” \nJang said that recipients of DACA must either have a high school diploma, currently be enrolled in school, or be honorably discharged from the military.\n“They’re not violent criminals,” she said. “They’re not people who are mooching off of the system. 90% of them pay their taxes consistently, so to get rid of [DACA] would be to [displace] people who have served in our military [or] spent their entire childhood living in America and benefiting the system.”\nAbdu Donka ’18, a board member of OOTB said, “Out of the Blue strongly believes in the enforcement of DACA and it being [an] executive action… We do not support Trump’s repeal because he’s really putting so many people’s [livelihoods] on the line: everything they’ve worked for, kids who are in the middle of college, people who are starting their jobs.”\nSusanne Torabi, International Student and Academy Travel Coordinator, recalls her experience of living in the United States as an immigrant.\n“Illegal. Of course, you could look at it that way, but what does it do to a person who is stamped like that? I remember what it did to me when I was looked as on paper [as a] foreign alien until I became a permanent resident and then, three years ago,…a dual citizen of Germany and the U.S,” she said.\nTorabi continued, “What I worry most about [is that] we have no idea about what number of our students, faculty, staff are affected by [the end of DACA] and how they deal with it. But it’s my obligation as a faculty member to make sure that the students feel safe… Because it’s a life in limbo and a life that is rollercoaster-like right now.”\nThompson Uwanomen ’19 said students should stay informed of events and decisions surrounding DACA. \n“Here at Andover awareness is key. Learning about DACA here especially would not only facilitate discourse, [but also ensure] that we aren’t completely oblivious to what’s happening outside of [school] and make it so that we incorporate our beliefs on [DACA] to everyday life here,” Uwanomen said.\xa0\nOOTB also hosted a phone-a-thon Wednesday afternoon as a follow-up to the “blackout.” The event held in front of Paresky Commons provided information for students to call Congress representatives and urge support for DACA.\n“[With] the phone-a-thon, we want to make sure that the Andover community is…\xa0 actually [making an effort], not just saying that we care about something,” said Jang. \n\n', 'Sep 15, 2017'), ('\nWhat do cadets training at West Point, teachers working at some of the most challenging schools, and children competing in the National Spelling Bee have in common? According to Angela Duckworth, the answer is simple: grit.\nDuckworth, a Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, author of The New York Times bestselling book “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance,” and recipient of 2013 MacArthur Genius Fellowship, spoke Wednesday night in Cochran Chapel about the importance of character and grit and afterwards recorded an episode of Andover’s “Every Quarter” podcast defining what grit means to her. \n“When I say grit, I mean that aspect of character that encourages us to be passionate about what we’re doing and persevering over a very, very long time period. So, both passion and perseverance for long-term goals,”she said in her podcast recording. \nHowever, Duckworth highlighted how being gritty does not imply that one should neglect self-care and happiness to achieve a goal.\n“When people are doing things that really harm themselves, and others, in the long-term [such as] not giving your friends your attention, not taking care of your health, not sleeping enough, feeling really bad about yourself because of failure, [they aren’t] actually being gritty because grit is about long-term stamina, and nobody can keep that up in the long term,” she said in the podcast. “And nobody should want to keep that up. So the magic of grit isn’t pulling all-nighters and being a crazy person. I think the magic of grit is knowing where you’re going.”\nIn a question-and-answer session at the end of her talk, Duckworth spoke directly to the Andover students in attendance and gave one takeaway she really hoped they would remember.\n“Life is really hard and there are going to be times when you’re going to be sad or anxious and make bad decisions… I know this is kind of a downer message, but I want to tell you that ultimately, it’s going to be okay,” she said. “And here’s a little science to comfort you: I can show you graphs of development over time, and where you are is like the perfect storm of emotional turmoil… So many things are in flux, and it can be a torturous time, to be honest. But, if I showed you these graphs of happiness, of character development, of grit, of well-being, of meaning and purpose, they all go up.”\nMiriam Feldman ’18, an attendee of the talk and subsequent dinner session, said Duckworth was personable and engaging. \n“I just want to say that everyone who wasn’t here should go watch it on MediaSpace right now,” she said. “The dinner in particular was a really amazing experience because she took the time to really listen to people, engage with the struggles of being a student at Andover [or any] high-powered learning environment.”\nMax Rigby-Hall ’18, another attendee, said, “The conversations she held with us, and her talk, really relates to this campus, and is something that is very applicable to us as a student body, and something that relates to privilege, which is something we talk about a lot.”\n\n', 'Sep 15, 2017'), ('\nFour cases of sexual misconduct during the 1970s and 1980s at Andover were disclosed in a letter sent to the Andover community\xa0via email on July 31 \xa0from Peter Currie ’74, President of the Board of Trustees, and Head of School John Palfrey. Five additional cases had previously been disclosed last August in a similar letter from Palfrey following an independent investigation by Sanghavi Law Office.\nOf the four cases noted in the July 31 letter, one involves a former student who engaged in sexual misconduct toward another student, while the three others center around faculty members engaging in sexual misconduct toward former students. Additionally, two former faculty members are identified in the newly released report from Sanghavi Law Office: Brian Davidson and Frederic Lyman. \nFormer faculty members H. Schuyler Royce and Stephen Wicks, as well as former writer-in-residence Alexander Theroux, were named in Palfrey’s August 2016 letter. \nIn total, Sanghavi Law Office has conducted 16 full investigations involving 13 alleged perpetrators. In each of these 16 cases, the firm determined the allegations to be worthy of “Investigations with Findings.” In an “Investigation with Findings,” the investigative team collects additional information through outreach and interviews to determine whether or not sexual misconduct occurred. \nThe full, written report from Sanghavi Law Office was released July 31. It can be accessed here.\n\n', 'Aug 3, 2017'), ('\nThe following letter was sent to members of the Andover community on July 31, 2017, at 4:45 p.m. E.S.T.\n\nDear members of the Andover community,\nWe write with an update regarding an independent investigation into matters of past sexual misconduct at Andover. As you may recall, in April 2016 we engaged Sanghavi Law Office to investigate any concerns brought forward to us.\nSanghavi Law Office delivered initial findings last summer, at which point John Palfrey wrote to the community to share what we knew at that time. Sanghavi Law Office has now issued a written report\xa0that addresses both the allegations received prior to August 30, 2016, and those received from August 30, 2016, to May 31, 2017.\nSanghavi Law Office conducted 16 full investigations, including those referenced in John’s letter of August 30, 2016.\xa0While they coordinated with us on the process of contacting parties and accessing files, Sanghavi Law Office conducted their investigation and reached each of their conclusions independently of the school.\nFurther to the five cases cited in John’s letter last August, the report reveals that Sanghavi Law Office additionally found that in one case a former student engaged in sexual misconduct involving another student and that in three cases former faculty members engaged in sexual misconduct involving students. Consistent with Andover’s criteria outlined below, we believe we have an obligation to identify two of those former faculty members: Brian Davidson and Frederic Lyman. Descriptions of each case can be found in the full report.\nOur threshold for public disclosure of past sexual misconduct is established by considering a series of factors:\n\nThe severity of the misconduct, its effect on the former student(s), and/or whether the school was made aware of multiple concerns of misconduct;\nWhether there exists an ongoing current risk to students at Andover or elsewhere;\nWhether the behavior of the faculty member violated Andover’s expectations; \xa0and\nWhether the allegations could be corroborated.\n\nAs we reflect on these painful moments, we know that Sanghavi Law Office’s independent work is just one piece of a broader view of sexual abuse in our school’s history. Highly publicized cases involving former faculty members—David Cobb and Richard Keller, for example—were not investigated by Sanghavi Law Office but significantly impact our overall understanding and contemplation of these issues. Further, as you will see in the report, more people have come forward with concerns of possible misconduct than the number of cases that resulted in a full investigation. Even as we seek to be thorough and transparent, we acknowledge that no report could possibly include a comprehensive account of all such matters that have taken place at the school.\nThe report also includes references to school guidelines and policies from the 1980s related to harassment and misconduct. While those policies were relevant to Sanghavi Law Office’s findings and investigation, they are not necessarily, in our view, the standards by which we guide behavior. Child protection remains our focus more so than any specific words or guidelines.\nAs we’ve sought to understand and ultimately learn from these most troubling moments in our school’s history, we remain grateful to all who have shared information. Each person who has come forward has shown tremendous courage. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, we extend our deepest apologies to these individuals and to all others who have been affected by any form of sexual misconduct at Andover. These transgressions must never occur again.\nConcerns brought to our attention after May 31, 2017, will be investigated by Sanghavi Law Office. As always, we encourage anyone with a concern regarding sexual misconduct involving students and/or faculty to please come forward.\xa0\nThroughout this process, our highest priorities have remained consistent: to learn as much as possible about those times when Andover did not uphold its commitment to student safety and well-being, to support those who have been harmed, and to ensure that today we are doing everything possible to nurture a healthy, safe, and supportive learning environment for every student in our care.\nWe are fortunate to have so many talented faculty, staff, and administrators dedicated to ensuring that every student has the resources, care, and support needed to thrive at Andover. Their unwavering commitment to student health and wellness is both vital and reassuring.\nWe are grateful to you—our extended Andover community—for your ongoing support of this important work.\nSincerely,\xa0\nPeter Currie ’74, P’03, President, Board of Trustees\nJohn Palfrey, P’21, Head of School\n\n', 'Aug 3, 2017'), ('\n\nPresident Trump will\xa0nominate Christopher Wray ’85 as next FBI Director.

The Chapel roared with laughter as the series of student and teacher acts, dances and musical performances entertained the audience for one of the last ASMs of the year.\nTwo performances that stood out to the audience the most were the performance of Adrian Khactu, Instructor in English, singing “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” as a way to say goodbye to Andover students before he leaves for another job next year, as well as the faculty dance group Ma’am Slam, according to audience member Anna Maniaci ’19.\n“My favorite act was [Ma’am Slam] dancing to the Bruno Mars song 24k Magic or [Mr. Khactu] \xa0singing his farewell song. Overall, [it was a] really upbeat and happy ASM. I thought [the ASM] was great.

Little did she know her essay would be published in “The New York Times” on May 12, 2017.\nGrowing up in New Haven, Conn., Sottile has always been aware of the lines separating poverty and wealth. The drastic difference between downtown New Haven and the campus of Yale University exposed the hierarchies of class and race established within the city. This bore her interest in topics involving socioeconomic class, and ultimately inspired her to write her college essay on the subject. \n“[New Haven] is a place that a lot of people talk about in a really careless way that doesn’t take into account the systematic causes of poverty and inequality in the city. I grew up just outside of the city, in a town that’s described as the first line of “white flight” from New Haven. So I’ve just always been very conscious of how class and race are marked up and divided… Class and income disparities are topics I’m really passionate about, and I don’t know if I would be had it not been for how I grew up,” said Sottile in an email to The Phillipian. \nHer essay begins recounting the moment she received an envelope which enclosed guidelines for the Tang Scholarship she had received to attend Andover. As a part of the amenities of the scholarship, Sottile received a Dell laptop. She goes on to describe how the laptop symbolized wealth disparity at Andover as well as her perspective on attending an elite boarding school on full scholarship.\n“My scholarship has affected my life at Andover a lot. For a while, it made me really anxious — the first time I told someone I was on full, I was terrified. But going forward, I’ve found a really awesome community of other students on varying levels of financial aid who can relate more to my background. I think I’ve tried really hard to make sure that I don’t feel like I have to fit in through my clothing or my choices to make up for the ways that I differ from most Andover students financially,” said Sottile.\nSottile was originally reluctant to write about financial aid as she deemed it a “risky topic.” However, after realizing how her background greatly affects her decisions in day-to-day life, she decided it was the best story to share.\n“It was hard to write because I wanted to make sure I had the right tone. Like, I think that there are easy narratives to tell about money as a highschooler: there’s the story where you’re privileged and then have some experience that makes you realize it, and there’s the story where you’re underprivileged but persevere and struggle and overcome your background. Neither of those are my story, and I didn’t want to make it seem like I was calling on either of those narratives,” said Sottile. \nSottile will attend Columbia University next fall. According to Sottile, she was attracted to New York City because of her passion for art and activism, and plans to double-major in Human Rights and Film.\n“I wanted to apply to Columbia because I feel like going to Andover really made me feel capable of doing whatever I want to do. Andover is a really supportive environment, and while I’ve really appreciated that, I’m ready for a more independent environment. I’m so excited to be able to go out into the city and have internships while also going to school.

After 20 years, her vision is becoming a reality with the recent renovation of Chase House and soon-to-be renovation of Bancroft Hall. \n“The work begun before my time as head and carried on during my tenure has now been finished under John Palfrey’s watch. [Chase House’s] renovation as well as Bancroft… has completed the plan of the successive dean of students. Now there are pleasing and comfortable dorms with plenty of faculty to live with, teach, and befriend and role model for students,” said Chase.\n“When I first came here as Head in 1994 those first several years, [my colleagues and] I were worried that some people who took their kids to some dorms would say ‘Oh no, we’re not living there.’ [But] I doubt that happens anymore,” Chase continued.\nHead of School John Palfrey also recognizes the progress Andover has made over the years specifically regarding dorm renovations. \n“In 1994, Barbara kicked off the commitment to renovate all of our dorms and to put in an additional home for a house counselor… and it turns out that this year we will finish that our 23 years later when Bancroft is renovated,” said Palfrey. \n“It takes a very long time for these things to happen… and I can find no more fitting way in perpetuity [for Ms. Chase] to be remembered than by having [her] name on a dorm because this commitment is in bricks and mortar in the form of these renovations that happened as well as all the things [she has] done to strengthen the community,” Palfrey continued.\nRebecca Miller Sykes, former Associate Head of School, believes that the new naming of Chase House was well-deserved.\n“Whether it was kindness, respect for human dignity, or her commitment to social justice, Barbara promoted fairness and recognized that especially in a residential school, how we treated one another was absolutely crucial,” said Sykes. \nEmma Duffy ’19, who lived in Chase House this school year, recognizes the values instilled within the Chase House community. \n“I love the community that Chase has… Everyone is really open, and you can have really interesting conversations with the people you run into in the hallway,” said Duffy. \n“I hope that Chase can continue to have this great community and stay welcoming to newer arrivals. Chase house was a safe, comfortable place for me to not only live, but also study in… and all the friends I have made here also make an impact to my time spent in Chase,” Duffy continued. \nThough Chase is no longer Head of School at Andover, Sykes hopes that her work, memory, and service to the Andover community will live on in Chase House and all its future residents. \n“I hope the Chase girls now and evermore will be like Andover and like Barbara, who practiced her belief that there are three important things in life: to be kind, to be kind, and to be kind,” said Sykes at the closing of her speech for the dedication ceremony.\n“[In my speech,] I said that the world desperately needs the leadership of good and wise, confident, resilient women, and I told the girls who were here ‘you will be ready,’ ” said Chase. “I hope that [residents] can give one another the kind of strength to persist.”\n\n', 'May 20, 2017'), ('\nClick here to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease subscribe!\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n', 'May 7, 2017'), ('\nThe Phillips Academy Democrats organized and hosted Andover’s first ever Progressive Action Conference last Saturday.

Corrie, too, was a fantastic presence, as she brought in a focus on diversity and education. So ultimately, we ended up not with an echo chamber but with some really great contrasting viewpoints for the audience to mull over,” she continued.\nSchwerin stressed the importance of having young people involved in politics, despite challenges. He specifically cited examples from the Women’s March and what happened in airports around the Muslim ban and healthcare.\xa0 \n“The election was incredibly disappointing, but I hope we can channel that disappointment into increased grassroots energy, as we’re already seeing around the country. Especially for young people, it’s so important not to get discouraged but instead get energized,” said Schwerin in an email to The Phillipian. \nChafee spoke about the false dichotomy that emerges when political beliefs are divided between two parties, which provoked discussion about the defining characteristics of the Democratic party and the increasing separation between the public and the government.\nThe panelists also talked about the path to effective activism, highlighting how activism is an integral part of participating in a society, and therefore necessary for change.\n“By one estimate, there are more than one million groups and orgs currently engaged in some form of social justice activism in the world today…all engaged in different kinds of actions and approaches to these problems. It’s a much more exciting, vibrant and open way of thinking about progressivism and political action,” said Martin in an email to The Phillipian. \n“Small groups (4-5 people) can make a huge impact on the issues they care most about, with just a few minutes of consistent organizing practice per day… We must exert control as tomorrow’s leaders and voters to protect and support America’s crumbling middle class and forgotten working class,” said Mazen in an email to The Phillipian. \nWhen asked about how this conference will affect the Andover community, Junah Jang ’20, who attended the conference, said, “In part thanks to the talk, I’ll be thinking a lot more about my political priorities and how to learn from the opinions of people here on campus. Hopefully, we can get to a point where we’re able to have productive conversations across differing viewpoints concerning the improvement of this campus, country, and ultimately the wellbeing of all people.”\n“Hopefully this conference will be a unifier. We sent our invitational email to PARS, the PA Republican Society. And we hope that the messages and the lessons learned from these speakers are going to be applicable to those involved regardless of different political backgrounds or affiliations, and that ultimately we will come away from this having learned as a community, not just based on Democrat or Republican beliefs,” said Matthew Cline ’19, board member of the PA Democrats Board.\n\n', 'May 5, 2017'), ('\nT.Rynne/The Phillipian\nOften seen roaming the Quads, Thayer Zaeder ’83’s cats have become a topic of discussion around campus. Zaeder, Instructor in Art and house counselor in Bishop Hall, and his family have seven cats: Max, age 10, Doctor De Soto, around age 10, Stewie, about age eight, TJ, about age three, Victor, age two, Tunechi, age one, and Melman, age one. All are rescue cats, most coming from the Another Chance Rescue organization.\nLately, the black cat, Doctor De Soto, has been seen in West Quad North and West Quad South. Often spending the night in Johnson Hall, he roams through halls and wanders into many students’ rooms. Although some girls in Johnson enjoy having the cat around, there are others who are scared of him and less welcoming of his frequent visits.\n“My hall gives the cat a lot of love and gives it food, so it started coming to our hall every time someone opens the door to Johnson. It will just come into our room if any of our doors were open,” said Singareddy.\n“I didn’t know it was in my room, but I could hear it meowing. I wake up to it meowing every day. Then I sit up, and it was lying on my feet, in my bed. I pushed it off and started screaming. It was terrifying,” she continued.\nOne reason people are scared of De Soto is because he’s a black cat, which can be viewed as a bad omen, according to Eamon Garrity-Rokus ’20, who lives in Rockwell House. Garrity-Rokus sees De Soto two or three times a week.\n“It’s not particularly enjoyable to see it, since it’s a black cat and it walks right across my path, which is supposed to be unlucky. It might just be a superstition, but the thought does cross my mind. It’s cool to see the cat and pet it, but it’s supposed to be an unlucky experience,” said Garrity-Rokus.\nSingareddy also claims that the gray cat, TJ, has followed her along the path.\n“There’s also a gray cat, TJ. It doesn’t come into Johnson, but it’s always on the path between Johnson and Rockwell. It’s so scary. That’s the one that chases you. At least the black cat doesn’t hurt you, but the grey one will chase you, which is terrifying,” she said.\nI.Lee/The PhilliT.J., pictured above, is known to haunt the path between Johnson and Rockwell.\nJair Suazo ’17 enjoys the company of some of the cats that follow him around the Quads. \nSuazo said, “I’m a fan of [one of the cats] because I usually try to model my lifestyle like her. She walks carelessly around the Quads, and so I always run into her. She’s always kind of defiant and always growls at me, and I kind of like that because I wish I could live carelessly like that beautiful cat.”\nEliot Zaeder ’17 confirmed that these cats are harmless and pose no danger or threat to anyone. \n“None of them have ever attacked anybody, or scratched, or bit anyone. They’re pets, not wild animals. With half the cats, you can just pick them up and they won’t do anything,” he said.\n “I think [the cats are] hilarious. It’s so funny, because I get videos from friends, who I’ve been with at school for four years, and they have the cat in their dorm room. They’ll take a picture with it, give it a little kiss on the cheek, and send it to me, and I just laugh. It’s really funny,” he continued.\n\n', 'May 5, 2017'), ('\nNon Sibi Weekend is an annual tradition at Andover that celebrates the school motto, “not for self.” Classes were cancelled while students participated in Community Engagement projects around campus and the surrounding area last Friday.\nEach grade had a specific theme to their activities. Juniors worked with families and children, Lowers worked with programs involving the environment, Uppers worked on projects helping the hungry and sick, and Seniors focused on housing and homelessness. However, due to the inclement weather, most of the outdoor activities were canceled for the Lowers.\nRoom to Grow\n“We organized the back stock room for an organization called Room to Grow which works on providing supplies and focuses on the emotional stigma of the mothers of the children who they’re helping. They work on making sure that kids have a good and strong childhood in the first three years of development, because that’s a critical step before kindergarten to keep up with their classes and to be at the same academic levels as their peers. I thought it was a really amazing organization and they did a great job of making sure that they also prioritized the mother’s health, and not just the child’s… making sure the mother has people to talk to. I thought it was amazing that there was one organization that could reach all of those levels.” -Eliza Scheer ’20\nWish Project\n“I went to the Wish Project. Essentially, it was a warehouse where people make their donations for clothes and furniture for anyone who might be in need of basic things. We sorted all of the incoming clothes and furniture into different piles and different seasons. It felt really good to help the community. It was also a bit sad because in some of the boxes there were birthday presents for kids whose parents couldn’t afford to buy them anything, so it made me really appreciate what I have.” -Anastasia Nikolaeva ’20\nProject Sunshine\n“We made crafts like friendship bracelets and cards for kids who are in hospitals. It meant a lot to me because I saw some of my closest friends go through diseases such as cancer and it really hit close to home because they were always in and out of the hospital. It felt really good to give back to kids who were in that specific situation.” -Ryan Kennedy ’20\nMass Audubon Belmont\n“I was signed up for Mass Audubon Belmont and we were supposed to do trail maintenance, weed, and build a fence for the goats. It unfortunately got cancelled. I was grateful for the extra time, but it also upset me. To me, non sibi means going out of your way to help others, which many of us didn’t get a chance to do this weekend.” -Sarika Rao ’19\nIMEC\n“IMEC [is a] a non-profit organization that sends medical supplies all across the globe. So, myself and a couple of my friends, we were there and we inspected medical supplies to make sure they were still good. \xa0If it was good then we repacked it and put it in an area to be shipped off in the next couple weeks or days. Non Sibi in general… I think it’s just to help people here if they’re privileged or nonprivileged. \xa0It’s just not something people do all the time…. So that’s very important. It puts things in perspective on your own life and your own experience, and experiences of people less fortunate than yourself.” -Jason Reynolds ’18\nSoup Kitchen\n“For Non Sibi Weekend I basically worked at a restaurant-style soup kitchen. I served food for people who could not access food themselves. I spoke to some people there and I learned a lot about their lives. It was a very interesting experience. I think Non Sibi Weekend is a very good practice honestly. A lot of students here don’t work with people outside of their socioeconomic group or on their own they may not help out. Non Sibi Weekend gives students a chance to interact with society, their environment, and interact with other people who they would not usually talk to every day.” -Jelani Wilson ’18\nRosie’s Place\n“A small group of Seniors went to a women’s center in Boston called Rosie’s Place, [which] helps provide counseling, health services, financial services, and food to homeless women, or women recovering from homelessness. What we, the students, did, was we went to the kitchen and helped prepare a few of the meals and then we were able to actually interact with them and serve them, so it was nice to have some hands-on work and actually encounter the women that were using this organization. It was very humbling to see another side of how people live and getting that experience as students at [Andover]. It was very impactful and it felt nice to give back.” -Laurel Wain ’17\n\n', 'May 1, 2017'), ('\n1,000 competitors across the world will participate in the 2017 Phillips Academy Capture the Flag competition (PACTF), an annual online computer security competition for middle and high school students. Divided into two rounds, PACTF Round 1 “Bartik” started on April 16th and will end on April 23rd, while Round 2 “Boole” will take place April 24th to 30th. The organizing committee will offer over $20,000 worth of prizes this year to its participants for both their accomplishments and participation, according to their website.\nYatharth Agarwal ’17, one of the students who launched PACTF, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Would you rather let someone read your mind or your phone? Think carefully, because today, your electronic devices might know more about you than you yourself: your location history 24/7, banking and health details, and everything in your photos and notes from years ago — all preserved in mint, pristine condition.”\n“Fear this age or hail this, but the world is becoming increasingly digital, and that means that keeping your data safe is more important than ever. Learning about cybersecurity is the first step to protecting that data,” he wrote.\nPACTF originally began with support and sponsorship from the Abbot Academy Association, the Nest, the CyLab Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Hariri Institute for Computing at Boston University.\nTony Zhaocheng Tan ’17, another student host of the event, said, “A few years ago, we were inspired to launch our own competition after participating in several cyber\xadsecurity competitions hosted by universities and high schools. At the time, there were surprisingly few CTF competitions available, and even fewer CTFs geared toward the high school level.”\n“PACTF aims to fill this gap with the primary goal of educating students about computer security and sparking their interest in the field. By creating interest in information security and computer science, PACTF will encourage the use of technology to solve problems and underscore the importance of proper security practices on the Internet,” he continued.\nThis year’s PACTF will be run by the Andover Techmasters club under the guidance of Maria Litvin and Jadrian Miles, both Instructors of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at Andover, and the sponsorship of Amazon, DigitalOcean, and J.P. Morgan.\n“We, the PACTF team, collaborate to write the competition problems. Each of us has our own specialties, such as Cryptography, Binary Analysis, and Web Security, and together we are able to come up with a variety problems. Furthermore, we strive to provide problems ranging from introductory to advanced, so that everyone can participate in the competition,” said Tan.\nLitvin had introduced the contest to Andover students in 2013 and to other schools throughout 2014 and 2016. She helps form the teams and is their self-proclaimed cheerleader and monitor.\n“As the advisor of the Computer Science Club at [Andover] for many years… I aim to introduce a great variety of CS activities and contests to our students, then let them run with it, helping with advice and logistics along the way. Students do all the work… I helped with advice and helepd promote PACTF to other CS teachers on professional listservs and social media,” wrote Litvin in an email to The Phillipian.\nMiles McCain ’19, former participant and current competition organizer, believes that PACTF engages participants in a broader discussion of Internet infrastructure systems by focusing on skills related to pattern recognition than merely technical hacking skills.\n“PACTF is unlike a lot of other CTF competitions in that it’s not solely focused on breaking complex systems… I’m hoping that the participants will finish PACTF with a better understanding of the Internet infrastructure as a whole, various cryptographic ciphers, and a generally improved understanding of how the digital world works,” said McCain.\n“We are only becoming more and more reliant on technology and…it’s important that everyone knows how to defend themselves, and understand the various attacks that are made every day,” he continued.\nPACTF hosted an event on Thursday, April 20th, at the Nest to explain the PACTF competition and encourage on campus to participate in challenges by forming teams with peers and discussing problem solving strategies.\nTan hopes to continue the event’s success from last year. He wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “When some participants told me that this competition had led them to discover a previously-unknown interest in cybersecurity, I knew that PACTF 2016 was successful in introducing students to this field.

Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, took place this past Sunday and Monday. The ceremony on Friday prefaced a talk by Dr. Daniel Goldhagen, former Harvard associate professor and author of “Hitler’s Willing Executioners.”\nHerbert Rimerman ’17, President of Andover’s Jewish Student Union, said, “This is the second year that we have [invited Goldhagen]. We loved having Dr. Goldhagen the first time because he was such powerful speaker and he had a great impact on a lot of us on campus. Since he came for Holocaust Remembrance Day the same time last year, it was pretty much a no-brainer to try and bring him back.”\nGoldhagen identified three forms of anti-Semitism: religious anti-Semitism motivated by strains of Christian belief in medieval Europe, racial anti-Semitism as practiced by the Nazis, and political anti-Semitism prevalent in ongoing conflicts between the Middle Eastern and Israeli states.\nThe speaker then highlighted the relevance of these historical instances to anti-Semitism witnessed in contemporary conflicts.\n“If we move away from the ancient sources and look to the contemporary world, particularly the Iraq war, it was said at the time…that a cabal of Jews [was] running the United States and British government [and] betraying their countries’ [interest] for their own nefarious purposes…[A claim supported by the fact that] Iraq was a presumable foe of Israel,” Goldhagen said during the presentation.\n“The reason why there’s so much anti-Semitism…is because there used to be so much [of it and] it’s not that easy for people to get rid of their views…[similar to how] Christian notions [of] the Jews’ alleged deeds and misdeeds became part of the common culture of Europe,” he continued.\nGoldhagen believes that students can help combat anti-Semitism and foster civil discourse by making an effort to better understand the intricacies of controversial situations and by trying to be impartial in how they analyze them.\n“One of the things to do is, I mean, take prejudice since we’re talking about it, is not to equate things because they seem to be similar in one dimension, or not to say that things are different because they’re different in one dimension, but when you’re comparing different things, different forms of prejudice, to look for both the similarities and the differences. And that’s true of any institution or any set of ideas, what are the similarities and what are the differences and how do you create a complex picture,” said Goldhagen.\nAnnie Lord ’19, who attended the presentation, said, “I definitely learned more about anti-Semitism on a global scale because before hearing his presentation I only really knew about it in terms of the Holocaust and not so much about the present day.”\nMax Levi ’19, another audience member, said, “As a Jewish student at Andover I thought he made some very interesting points because on a day to day basis people don’t mean to be anti-Semitic but sometimes a few of their comments can come off that way.

Relay for Life, a worldwide event, is American Cancer Society’s largest fundraiser in the United States, according to their website. At Andover this year, a total of 203 participants collectively raised 28,465 dollars out of the 60,000 dollars goal, contributing to the 150,000 dollars raised by the school over the previous three years.\nRelay for Life began with an opening ceremony and the Survivor Lap, where survivors of cancer walked a lap around the track. Participants trailed behind the survivors after the relay officially began.\n“[It’s] something that I’ve done as a participant for each year that it’s happened, which I think is every year that I’ve been at Andover, but as cheesy as it sounds, I relay to find a cure,” said Bennett Sherr ’17.\nAlexandra LeBaron ’20 said, “I thought that the event was so well-run, and it was very powerful to see everyone walking together in solidarity for a cause that they believe in.”\nThe organizers provided a photo booth for teams and participants to take pictures. Participants were also welcome to honor someone by writing the name of a friend or family member on paper bags. These were later filled with glow sticks during the Luminaria Ceremony, which also featured student stories on the effects of cancer in their personal lives. The speakers included Rowan Curley ’20, Kaitlin Hoang ’17, and Myioshi Williams ’17.\n“My dad died from Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which is a type of cancer, when I was three years old, and my grandmother died in 2011 from breast cancer, so I just think that without going through those losses I would definitely be a different person. I think I’m stronger and I know how to fight for what I believe in more because of that,” said Curley.\nCurley hopes that people realize the large spread of cancer and work together to solve and heal from its effects.\n“I hope that people will understand that they’re not alone in this and that people everywhere, wherever you look, have been affected by cancer. I don’t think I’ve met one person who doesn’t have a friend or family member that has been affected by, or even died, from cancer. I think that people should understand that everyone is here and everyone is trying to fix this issue,” said Curley.\nThe event also incorporated musical performances by the Yorkies and Blake Campbell ’18, as well as dance performances featuring Alexa Goulas ’18 and Kiki Kozol ’18. Kiarah Hortance ’17 and Sabrina Appleby ’17 performed Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” heralding a lap of silence in the dark.\n“I thought it was a beautiful and powerful event.

The club worked closely with Christina Barry from American Cancer Society, who helped make the relay possible.\n“The board worked really hard to organize the event and seeing all of the participants come together, enjoy, and celebrate showed us all why we relay had why relay is so important in our community. Everyone coming together to expresses support for members of the community affected… us in an unforgettable and vital way,” said Murphy.\nIn the future, Kruizenga hopes that Andover’s Relay For Life will reach full community participation, as well as a significant increase of donations to help cancer research.\n“I want to see a cure for cancer. I don’t want anyone have to ever hear the words, ‘You have cancer’ or anyone to go through actually having cancer, going through the treatments or going through supporting someone who does has cancer.

The investigation was launched after Cheyenne Montgomery, a former student at Choate during the 1990s, reported an account of sexual assault that she had experienced as a student in 1992, according to “The New York Times.”\nAfter reexamining all accounts of sexual misconduct in its school history, Choate uncovered various sexual offenses, including those of 24 victims that were involved with 12 adults formerly affiliated with Choate, stated “The New York Times.”\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, said, “My thoughts are with the Choate community as it grapples with the painful information uncovered in its investigation. I hope the process serves to support survivors and to make all of our schools healthier and safer places for the students in our care.”\nInvestigations such as Choate’s have become more common in the boarding school community in the past decade. After Phillips Exeter Academy disclosed four faculty members that had allegations of sexual misconduct in March 2016, “The Boston Globe’s” Spotlight Team released an investigative report on sexual misconduct at New England boarding schools in May.\nSoon after, Head of School John Palfrey sent an email to the Andover community announcing a similar investigation into Andover’s history of sexual misconduct conducted by the Sanghavi Law Office. The investigation eventually uncovered five cases of sexual misconduct against students in the 1970s and 1980s.\nChoate’s report, published on April 13 and conducted by former prosecutor Nancy Kestenbaum, was sent out to the members of the Choate community while an apology was written by Michael Carr, Choate Class of ’76, and Headmaster Alex Curtis in response to the administration’s handling of the misconduct.\n“This report therefore focuses on instances of sexual misconduct by Choate faculty and staff members. Consistent with the school’s policies dating back to the 1970s, which explicitly forbid ‘sexual relationships or deep emotional attachments’ with students, we have interpreted the term ‘sexual misconduct’ broadly and use that term in our report to include a range of inappropriate behaviors,” states the report.\nThe report ended by thanking those who came forward to give information and included ten other accounts of incidences that could not be sufficiently substantiated.\nSophia Baum ’19 said, “Choate made the right decision to uncover past cases of sexual assault. It not only provides justice for those that had to endure it, but also shows that Choate, like many other schools, takes responsibility for their actions. Choate’s courage to face these cases head on sets a good example for how other schools should handle cases of sexual assault.”\nAbdu Donka ’18 expressed his concerns over the revelations cast onto the Choate community, and praised Choate for initiating the investigation.\n“It’s frightening, at a place where students are supposed to trust adults. Those sexual misconduct allegations are cases where kids had trusted the adults and the adults abused that trust,” said Donka\n“I feel as though it’s good that the schools are getting law firms to investigate this and to polish all the findings and send them out publicly.

As this year’s Means Essay Prize competition finalists, the three presented declamations of their personal essays that touched on a range of topics of their personal identities.\nFounded in 1868 by William G. Means, the Means Essay Prize stands as Andover’s oldest English award. Each year, the English Department selects three essays, which are then read to the school by the finalists themselves. This year, Holch, Hjerpe, and Wu were selected from dozens of applicants.\n“These essays are excellent examples in the ways in which politics can infest itself in the everyday… They were chosen because we… believe that the content and presentation of the works provide an exciting and provocative opportunity to engage in, what at times, can be sober material,” said Juan Gallardo, Teaching Fellow in English and one of the essay judges, during the ASM.\nHolch’s essay focused on her memories in Israel, where she spent five weeks as part of the Bronfman Youth Fellowship program. Holch was one of 26 selected students from North America and spent the summer of 2016 visiting parts of Jerusalem and studying Jewish texts with 25 other rising Seniors at the time.\n“I think a lot of [my essay] is about language, repetition of Hebrew prayers and thinking about what words mean and how language can serve as both a boundary and a form of occupation and a form of oppression and thinking about what that means… A lot of it is my own personal spirituality and my own personal beliefs about humans rights and things like that,” said Holch.\nReflecting on his experience being stood up on his first Tinder date with another man, Hjerpe provided insight to his struggles of finding companionship in the queer community. Hjerpe hoped that his essay would help break idealized representations of the queer community in mainstream media today.\nC.Munn/The PhillipianJack Hjerpe ’17 explored his sexuality and experience withonline dating.\n“I think that being a part of the queer community, Tinder has been a large part of our lives… I just know of so many people having misconceptions on it and, you know, this idealized version of how [it works]. Like when you watch TV and things, you don’t ever see a teenager logging into a dating app and trying to find someone to hook up with,” said Hjerpe.\n“I really wanted to try and tell a more realistic narrative, so if there are kids in the audience that are young and using Tinder because they just can’t find people of other sexual orientations to hook up with, like that’s not an awful thing, it doesn’t make you an immoral person, which is something that a lot of queer people in the community have had to deal with,” Hjerpe continued.\nAs an international student from Beijing, China, Wu reflected on the changes in her family dynamic ever since she began to attend Andover. Wu’s essay touched upon the distance between her and her grandfather and the struggle of losing touch with her Chinese heritage due to her time in America. Inspired by the dialogue and people she encountered in the Asian-American Footsteps Conference, Wu decided to write an essay to convey her emotions on this personal issue.\nC.Munn/The PhillipianEvelyn Wu ’18 spoke about her unique relationship with hergrandfather.\n“One of the things that I’ve realized is this concept that a lot of us feel about losing parts of our culture due to being American…For my first few years, I was super insecure about my Asian heritage, and no one would really talk to me about that. And then I went to the Asian American Footsteps Conference… and I was surrounded by all these kids… They weren’t super comfortable with the heritage that they were born with, and that was when I realized that this stuff… is really personal to a lot of people, and there’s not a lot of attention on it,” said Wu.\nBrian Ko ’19, an audience member, said, “I really liked Evelyn’s because I felt like it was the one that most related to me… Because I also am truly a very American Asian, even though I have never lived in South Korea at all… [the essay] just spoke to me.”\nAll three finalists encountered different, personal challenges while writing their essays. Following similar writing processes, each finalist pieced together thoughts, ideas, and sections of writing into longer, cohesive essays.\n“When you write, you’re put with this responsibility of putting whatever you’re trying to write about into words and making it accurate. What was most difficult for me was not to make it fluffy cheese, and not to make it just pretty words on a page, and make it actually resonate with me,” said Wu.\nAlex Ren ’17, an audience member, said, “I actually cried at the second one because man, do I feel. I feel like the ability to weave a piece of art that is unique to you, the story only you could tell, and make it resound in your audiences is a true talent of storytelling.”\nAccording to all three contestants, the overall experience of speaking in front of the entire Andover community was rewarding in its own manner.\n“I was able to stand up on that stage and talk to this prestigious school in this really esteemed position of being a finalist for the Means Essay and talk about my sex life, and about going on Tinder, and getting stood up on a date, and about all these different things that I felt are traditionally not given the time of day, because they’re deemed to be not suitable for public conversation, and that was where I definitely felt most empowered throughout the entire experience and what I liked the best about it,” said Hjerpe.\nHolch, who mentioned on stage that presenting her Means Essay was a part of her Senior bucket list, said, “Getting to see the view from the stage in the Chapel and getting to have that experience of speaking in front of all of my peers was not always one of my goals, but I realized that we only have six weeks left, and that was something that I wanted to be able to say someday that I had done.”\nEditor’s Note: Evelyn Wu is an Illustration Editor for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Apr 21, 2017'), ('\nA package of rainbow, nostalgic fun, in the form of 7,000 plastic balls was recently intercepted by Andover’s Central Services.

After they intercepted the package, Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, was quickly informed and the contents never made their way to the students who initially placed the order.\nThe students behind this unconventional order were Seniors living in Taylor Hall. Motivated to make the best out of an empty room in the dormitory, they collectively came up with the idea of transforming this vacant room into a ball pit. Asa Ackerly ’17 took the leading role in the completion of this plan.\n“It started when our friend got removed from the dorm and we just sort of had a spare room on our hands. We tried to think of creative but realistic options that didn’t seem too typical for a boarding school dorm room. We finally decided on a ball pit. It’s colorful, it’s fun, it’s relaxing and who wouldn’t love to come back from classes every day to a giant pool of childish fun?” said Ackerly.\nAccording to Ackerly, thorough planning had gone into the perfecting of this idea, with the objective of making it a realistic and viable option.\nWithout consulting with any faculty members, the students went through with their idea, and ordered what would be required to construct this ball pit.\n‘‘We ordered 7,000 plastic balls on eBay to the mailroom. Many suggested that it still wouldn’t be enough to completely fill the room. We had plans to order as many as necessary if that initial order wasn’t sufficient. We also had plans to construct a custom wooden barrier at the woodshop to prevent unwanted spilling of balls,’’ said Thomas Godwin ’17, one of the students involved with the ball pit concept.\nAccording to Ackerly, the construction of this ball pit would not have had any negative consequences, however, the faculty had a contrasting opinion. Despite no explicit rule disallowing the possibility of making a ball pit out of a student’s room, the Seniors were not given the opportunity to capitalize on their idea.\n“A lot of it seems to do with reputation. Given Taylor’s previous record of misconduct, a lot of faculty were skeptical that we would try to do something crazy and inappropriate with the balls. There was also most likely an aspect of Murphy’s law where some faculty probably envisioned a plastic, colorful nightmare that would go on to haunt them for years to come. Some faculty members also cited sustainability issues,” said Edward Elson ’17, a friend of Ackerly and contributor to the plan.\nDespite the intentions of the students, the plan was not able to be executed. By request of the Dean of Students, the 7,000 plastic balls are on their way back to the manufacturer to be put to use elsewhere.\n\n', 'Apr 15, 2017'), ('\nClick here to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease subscribe!\n\n', 'Apr 15, 2017'), ('\nT.Rynne/The PhillipianKaitlin Hoang ’17, Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics and Astronomy, Paige Morss ’17, Maria Caso ’17, and Preston Dial ’17 pose in front of the observatory.\nThere were only 125 binary asteroids that had been found and identified by the world’s astronomers. Last December, however, Andover’s Astronomy Research class discovered the 126th binary asteroid in a belt between Mars and Jupiter. Most asteroids in space are solitary, but binary asteroids are distinguished by a moon in their orbit. The astronomy class was originally monitoring asteroid van Woerkom 4296 when they discovered its moon.\n“[The class does] a project where they’re trying to figure out the rotation period of an asteroid. They’ll choose an asteroid… and they’ll take pictures of it every night. Since the asteroid is not just a sphere, as it rotates, the sun reflects on it slightly differently. So they’re able to look and see how the brightness changes over a period of time. [A new group of students] picked the asteroid van Woerkom, and [when] they looked at the data… you find two different periods: one that is the actual asteroid and one which is the moon going around it,” said Ethan Brown ’17, a member of the astronomy class.\nVan Woerkom’s moon’s diameter is approximately 30 percent the size of the asteroid itself. According to Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics and Astronomy, finding a binary asteroid is exciting because of it’s rarity and how the asteroid itself has big enough mass to carry a moon.\nOdden said, “This is the first binary asteroid we’ve discovered. We have discovered some other cool things, such as binary stars that the students have been able to record as discoveries. They’re also in the process of following up on some exoplanets, which is another kind of discovery. They’ve done lots of cool things, and some of those things are discoveries, but this particular one is new and different.”\n“We’re lucky to have a telescope that has good enough resolution to pick up on the fact that there is a binary asteroid and also have access to the technology to make light curves. I think that [the discovery] also shows that we have talented students who work on the astronomy projects… When you’re doing astronomy research, you are actually making scientific discoveries,” said Paige Morss ’17, one of the students who discovered the binary asteroid.\nVan Woerkom was officially registered as a binary asteroid in the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) last January. The registration announces the discovery to the astronomy community. “The Minor Planet Bulletin,” an astronomy publication, will also release an issue on the details of the discovery and the specific light curves. All of the students involved in the discovery will be named on the paper.\nBrown is currently taking his fifth term of astronomy research. He says that he is drawn to the class because of the potential discoveries that can occur when cataloging asteroids and looking at their data.\n“The work that we do on the asteroid project is less groundbreaking, analytical research, and more that there’s so much out there and we just want to be able to catalog it all… This is just doing the hard work and cataloging them… So if someone [in the future] were to say that they wanted to do research specifically on binary asteroids, they have another one that they can include in their data… It’s extremely important for these discoveries to be made. The sheer number of asteroids makes it hard for all of them to be closely monitored and cataloged, so Andover’s contribution helps add to our knowledge of space as a whole,” said Brown.\nOdden’s astronomy class will continue to catalogue and collect data on asteroids.\nOdden said, “In astronomy, and in science in general, the goal is to extend knowledge and human understanding. This is just one piece in a very big puzzle, like a lot of discoveries are. There are some discoveries that are huge, and worthy of a Nobel Prize. But most of the time, there are many discoveries that together push science forward”\n\n', 'Apr 14, 2017'), ('\nA.Tadikonda/The PhillipianEtsy believes incorporating wellness into all aspects of student life is crucial.\nWellness education surrounds Andover students both inside and outside of classes. Susan Esty, the current designer of wellness education at Andover, was appointed the Director of Wellness Education for next fall, a new position at Andover.\nEsty, along with the four course heads representing each grade, Aya Murata, Associate Director in College Counseling; Erin Strong, Instructor in Theatre and Dance; Anny Candelario-Escobar, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science; and Taylor Ware, Associate Director in College Counseling will work together to develop the empathy, balance, and inclusion classes.\nBeginning with alcohol and drug education in the 80s, according to Esty, wellness education has expanded to address self care and life issues, such as in Personal and Community Education classes. The Andover community is taught to think about oneself and others through wellness education.\n“I think we felt that there’s a lot of new programming that we are providing for our students that is requiring more and more coordination. We have so many folks on campus who are really excited and qualified to do this work, and we felt that we were needing a champion of wellness… Just as we have a medical director and a director of psychological services, it made sense to have a director of wellness education too,” said Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life.\nEsty is trying to identify students’ needs and engage with community partners to develop the curriculum. As of now, Juniors are taking Foundations, a program similar to P.A.C.E. designed for Juniors, during their English red dot period and will take Endeavors next year as Lowers.\n“I think the importance of [wellness education] is reminding everybody in this community that we have to learn about it and think about it like any other topic in our lives… Even though those are skills that we may have, we don’t always practice them. Or maybe there are skills we haven’t developed because they’re not traditionally academic topics,” said Esty.\nEtsy is a trained counselor and a school administrator who has experience in the field of social justice programming and health. She also ran an advising program at another independent school and has developed a lot of wellness curriculum from there.\n“She had a real wealth of first hand experience coming to Andover, and this past year, Dr. Esty has done a tremendous job working directly with students and partnering with colleagues in all parts of campus to be thinking about wellness in a broad sense and also in a direct and deliberate sense,” said Elliott.\nEsty said that she wants to find synergy and bridge different parts of campus such as the office of Community and Multicultural Development, the Brace Center, Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center, where she works now, academic classes, and more. She also wants to continue working with the athletic department, which has been incorporating wellness education into the Physical Education curriculum for decades, according to Esty.\nAccording to Elliott, the community around wellness education is thinking about how a four year program during the day can be deliberately incorporated into students’ lives, complemented by the residential and advising programs. She wishes to establish a shared vocabulary with the Andover community around wellness.\nWhen asked about what she looks forward to in undertaking the role of Director of Wellness Education, Esty said, “I feel so passionately about wellness that what I look forward to is just spreading the word around this campus. There are many opportunities for students and I think we get really busy and don’t always stop and smell the roses… I see my role as a bridge between different groups and a partner with lots of different people.” \n\n', 'Apr 14, 2017'), ('\nRelaxing from a stressful day at work and hectic night with her young children, Megan Paulson, Instructor in History, turns to the kaleidoscope of colorful candies found on the Facebook and mobile game sensation, Candy Crush, Paulson recounts. Paulson, currently on level 2428, started playing in 2012 when the game first launched on Facebook. She is now a beta tester for new levels that are released on the mobile platform.\n“I like cheesy phone games and this was the ultimate [game]. Smoother play and better graphics than Bejeweled. Plus, it’s something to do that requires little mental energy. When it came out, I was an exhausted, working mother of two kids under the age of [three]. I needed an escape and reading for fun was much too taxing, watching something required noise which might disturb sleeping children, so online/phone games on mute were ideal,” wrote Paulson.\nCandy Crush is a puzzle game where players match three or more “candies” of the same color. The matched candies are then eliminated from the board and new colored candies take their place. The game has also introduced special “power-ups” that appear after matching four or more same-colored candies. These unique moves can eliminate greater numbers of pieces at a time. The player must accomplish a specific goal to pass a level, such as eliminating certain pieces under a time limit or reaching a certain score.\nPaulson wrote, “I think [three] months is the longest I’ve spent on a level. It’s not stressful when I can’t complete a level because this is my stress reduction. I liken it to doodling or drawing circles over and over and over again. It’s mind numbing.”\nPaulson prefers playing the game to watching television and uses the game to fall asleep. After finishing all the levels, Paulson is now able to try new levels while they are being developed. As a beta tester, she completes a survey after every game to send feedback to the company.\n“I didn’t volunteer or anything… I eagerly await each new episode and I think it was pretty obvious to the [higher] powers… that I was hardcore. I don’t get paid, there is no expectation for me to play any amount of time and I can pretty much stop at anytime. But, why would I want to?” wrote Paulson.\nAfter finishing the regular Candy Crush levels, Paulson also resorts to playing the spin-off versions of Candy Crush Jelly or Candy Crush Soda Saga.\n“I will say it’s disappointing when you get the little Candy Crush men at [the] work sign, and [the sign] says: ‘Stay tuned! More levels are coming soon’… [The spin-off’s] are sub-par if you ask me,” wrote Paulson.\nAlthough Paulson plays the game alone, she competes with one of her friends from college to see who can be the first to finish all the levels. She and her friend attended Stanford University and, according to Paulson, both friends enjoy seeing patterns in the game.\n“It’s actually a little embarrassing… if you add up the amount of time I’ve spent playing this game it would probably amount to a solid 2 months. Luckily, it’s got… limited lives, so when I exhaust my 5 lives, I can then engage with the real world,” wrote Paulson.\nAfter many hours dedicated to playing the game, Paulson has one piece of advice for people who want to excel at Candy Crush: “there are much better and more worthy pursuits to which you can devote yourself. I’d recommend those.”\n\n', 'Apr 14, 2017'), ('\nR.Prem/The PhillipianParesky Commons is run by a staff of about 80 people, many of which have been at Andover for over 20 years.\nLaughter erupted from an appreciative crowd as Nestor Payan, a Paresky Commons worker who participated in the commons appreciation event, gave a performance impersonating various Paresky workers.\nThis Wednesday, Alianza Latina, a club on campus that unites the Latinx community, hosted the Paresky Commons appreciation day to celebrate Paresky workers on campus. Even though not all Paresky workers are Latinx, a majority are, and Alianza Latina felt it was appropriate to host the event. The event consisted of snacks, drinks, and games which then decided who would receive gifts prepared by the club. \nEmily Ortiz ’19, a board member of the Alianza Latina, said, “Alianza Latina is a group where anyone can come and learn about Latinx culture, Latinx identity, and issues that affect the community… [Paresky] Commons appreciation is an annual thing hosted by Alianza Latina in celebration of our workers here on campus. Not all our workers are of Latinx descent, but since a majority are, we thought it was appropriate to host this [event].”\nThe Paresky Commons appreciation event is an annual occasion, and Alianza Latina takes charge in organizing the event. Last week, Alianza Latina had a bake sale in order to gather fund to buy gifts for the Paresky workers. They focused on creating a break during the middle of the day, so that the Paresky workers can relax and have fun.\nErin Vasquez ’19, also a board member of Alianza Latina, said, “We do this every year, and last year we had an Abbot Grant fund, so we had lot more money to plan [the event]. But this year, we had to fundraise our own money, so basically we got bunch of presents and small snacks and stuff. We’ll just hang out with them and have fun by playing Spanish version of Bingo, or maybe a Karaoke. We basically plan to create a break on Wednesday, so that they have some time to relax and have fun.”\nAccording to Vasquez, Alianza Latina felt the need to host this event in response to the Paresky workers’ tireless effort to support Andover students. Also, the club believes some students do not seem to recognize their hard work, and this event will help to spread more awareness of what Paresky workers are doing for the Andover community.\nS.Alshaiba/The PhillipianAlianza Latina hopes to increase recognition and appreciation toward the hard work of Paresky Commons Staff.\n“We started the [Paresky] Commons appreciation event because [Paresky] Commons workers do so much for us. They make our meals everyday, if they weren’t there, we wouldn’t be eating. I think we sometimes forget, [and] not recognize their hard work,” said Vasquez.\nSome students addressed that Paresky workers are often underappreciated and are taken for granted. Araba Aidoo ’20, an audience of the Paresky Commons appreciation event, said, “I feel that holding this event was important because [Paresky] Commons workers are very underappreciated for everything that they do for us.. They feed us 24/7 so I feel we should be appreciating them everyday but to have a day especially for them is really important to show them that we really do notice they’ve done for us and all.”\nPayan, the winner of this year’s Lotería, a Spanish version of bingo, said, “Of course, of course, [I am definitely happy] did you see my face? That is what I like, I like to see the people smile. I make a joke, [and] everyone [smiles], that is what I like, what I do… I hope [looking forward to next year’s potential appreciation event], I’ll be prepared. I am an actor.”\nAlianza Latina looks forward to see more recognition and appreciation of the Paresky workers’ hard work. They also hope the community to begin helping Paresky workers by doing little things that can help reduce the work pressure.\n“Even if students don’t participate in this event, I think there are some small things that we should do to make their lives more easier like put our plates away, if you make a mess, clean it up,” said Vasquez.\n\n', 'Apr 14, 2017'), ('\nClick here\xa0to view this week’s newsletter.\nPlease subscribe!\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2017'), ('\nThe second\xa0installment in a series about religion at Andover.

At that moment I realized that we had to connect Dr. Treuer with students at [Andover].’’ said Wheeler.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Treuer said he spoke in many different countries to raise awareness of the misconceptions and lasting discrimination against Native Americans. \n“For native people [having just one black teacher] is probably the most common experience. Even the schools on an Indian reservation with 100% native kids usually have almost entirely non-native teachers,” said Treuer.\nAttending students were then able to connect with Dr. Treuer and ask him various questions. The back and forth between the students and Treuer touched on topics like the political incorrectness of the term “Indian”, President Donald Trump’s stance on immigration, and the oppression dynamics of today’s society. \nAudience members found Truer’s words very revealing about the nature of life as a Native American and appreciated the perspective Truer offered. \nAnnie Donahue ’18 said, ‘‘I really enjoyed how revealing this presentation was in terms of the modern day life of Native Americans.

The PSPA records and uploads these faculty-led videos to their website. This allows parents to watch and participate in school affairs indirectly through the online website.\n“I personally came to the PSPA because I was curious about what it was all about. I went to one of those monthly meetings, and sat in and just listened. It was a good opportunity for me to hear what the group was involved in, and at the same time asking if I would like to volunteer. I’d encourage any parent who is able to to reach out in any way they can,” said Fleming. \nJackie Welch, Co-President of the PSPA board, said, “PSPA provides an opportunity and a vehicle for parents to become directly involved in activities that support the community. So it’s a wonderful way for parents who are either local, or have boarding students to be involved in a specific way that helps contribute to the community. That’s why I got involved, and I think that’s why any parent who’s involved in PSPA is.”\nSome parents join PSPA through the Campus Closet, which opens at all the major campus events and at least one Friday every month. According to Fleming, volunteering for the Campus Closet is the simplest way for parents to get involved in PSPA events.\nAngelreana Choi ’19 said, “I really appreciate the Campus Closet because [it is] a great way for us to buy Andover gear… The parents always are very kind.” \nAbhinav Tadikonda ’20 said, “They have everything you’re looking for — raincoats, slippers, sunglasses, pajamas, anything you need throughout the year… I think they do a great job of stocking the closet and also being there to help students get what they need.”\nThe organization recently donated a peaceful water feature to the Wellness Center in coordination with the building’s recent opening.

Unfortunately, when Brown’s fighter crashed, the airframe crumpled, leaving Brown stuck within it. \nHudner stayed with Brown until the last moment possible, when the rescue helicopter had to leave before the night set in.\n“Captain Hudner requested for Jesse Brown to be his wingman, and Captain Hudner has been quoted as ‘he saw a great pilot, he never actually saw the color of his skin.’ Hudner is a wonderful example of how inclusion and diversity and youth from every quarter of the world is the core of [Andover’s] values,” said Jennifer Savino, Director of Alumni Engagement in an interview with The Phillipian. \nIt was a joyous day for 90-year-old Hudner, but the christening also brought back grievous memories of fallen comrade Brown. Andover alumni and faculty, family, friends and even Hudner’s fellow crew members flocked to Bath to honor Hudner’s selflessness.\n“Close to 50 graduates are currently serving in our Armed Forces around the globe, all living Non Sibi to the fullest. Andover probably has more Medal of Honor recipients of any secondary school in the US, eight total with Captain Tom Hudner ‘43 being our one living graduate recipient of our nation’s highest award for valor in combat,” wrote Dean in an email to The Phillipian. \n“Witnessing the christening of the USS Thomas Hudner at the Bath Iron Works in Maine this past Saturday was absolutely moving.\xa0 Captain Hudner was there to be thanked by his nation for his valorous attempt on 4 [December] 1950 to save his wingman Jesse Brown,” continued Dean.\nThis massive warship displaces 10,000 tons of water and can reach a top speed over 35 miles per hour. \nSavino said, “The future crew of the ship were there, the hundreds if not thousands of workers who had made this ship, this behemoth were there. Many veterans of the Korean war, many active duty naval personnel, as well as Maine’s four members of Congress and some people from the Pentagon, were there.”\nFor his valiant efforts to try and rescue a comrade, President Harry Truman awarded Hudner the Congressional Medal of Honor, the US Military’s most esteemed award. Hudner’s act of sacrifice also reflects the long-standing core value of the Andover community.\n“I think more important than the ship was what he received the medal of honor for, its a really powerful event. It’s a powerful statement of his character and that reflects incredibly well on the school. That’s why at least four times, people mentioned Non Sibi as a principle of his life which his action and career is a great manifestation,” said Michael Hudner, first cousin of Thomas Hudner. \n“There were numerous references to Non Sibi by both Navy people and I think some of the politicians because the incident that led to the recognition of Tom for the Medal of Honor was very selfless thing. Not for self. That was kind of interesting to me,” he continued.\n\n', 'Apr 7, 2017'), ('\nS.Bloom/The PhillipianBruce Poliquin ’72 (R, Maine-2nd District) and Seth Moulton ‘97 (D, Mass.-6th District) have starkly contrasting voting records on several of the House’s recent bills and measures. All data is from FiveThirtyEight and congress.gov.\nWhat is the mood in Washington D.C. right now following the election?\nThe mood is fear and uncertainty. I think that there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who are worried that the [fundamentals] of our democracy are being undermined by the Trump administration. Even among Trump supporters, there’s great uncertainty, because his administration is so chaotic… [In the House], we’re just trying to make sure that the administration follows the Constitution… and we’re trying to make sure that an enemy of the United States, mainly Russia, doesn’t interfere in our democracy. The connections between the Trump team and Russia, one of our long time enemies, is as you know, of the most serious concern. And we owe it to the American people to find the truth.\nHow has the election and the new administration changed the way you approach your job?\nOf course it’s more difficult when the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. It means that they have less incentive to work across the aisle…. At least in the last administration, Republicans knew that if we passed the bill that the President didn’t like, [the President] didn’t have to sign it. Now we’ve lost that leverage… So I would say that Washington is more divided. Now, one place where you’ll see Democrats and Republicans come together is to re-equate opposing the Trump administration.\nHow easy or difficult is it to make change in the House?\nWell, it’s very easy for the Republicans… if they can’t get things done, then they are an utter failure at government. And the reality is that they haven’t been able to get anything done, because they’ve been too constrained by the scandals of the administration and their own bad ideas like repealing Obamacare without a replacement… In terms of getting things done [for Democrats], it’s hard when you’re the minority. We are willing to work with Republicans on priorities that we share for the American people.\nIs there a common ground for Democratic and Republican views?\nIf you get right down to it, [Democrats and Republicans] actually agree on most things. It’s just that we focus on the places that where we disagree… Our foreign policy is a place where we can put politics aside, [but] it is not always the case. Sadly, I think the Republicans have been particularly partisan about some of our financial security issues lately. But that’s a place where we really want to do what’s best for our security and for our troops… [and where we] work closely together.\nWhat have been some issues that you’ve pushed for the interest of your district?\nEconomic development is hugely worked on, an awful lot of work [is done] in cities and towns across the district, but especially in Lynnfield, [Massachusetts]… [We’ve] Done a lot of work on bringing innovation into the fishing industry and getting fishermen and scientists together to agree on the science for a sustainable fishery… [We’ve] done a lot of education work for the number of educational institutions in the district. A lot of support for small businesses… We’ve done work on the opioid crisis, the getting funding for local health centers, big advocate of the North South Railway, which will improve transportation access throughout the whole region, including the district.\nWhen do you act in the interests of the district specifically, and when do you act in the interest of the country as a whole?\nI always consider both. My duty is to represent the interest of the district, but I swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States. So I’m never going to support my district at the expense of the country.\nHow has your time at Andover shaped your political career?\nAndover’s motto of Non Sibi is what public service is all about.

Unlike previous years of visiting the Dean of Students Office for an ‘in-person’ lottery, Juniors, Lowers, and Uppers will receive their housing numbers electronically, according to Jennifer Elliott ’94 Dean of Students and Residential Life. As it has been done in previous years, students will then be sorted into preferred dorms based on housing numbers.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Elliott wrote, “We are trying to make our housing process more efficient and less stressful, while maintaining the balance we have always sought to strike between student agency and faculty insight. We would like for students to have a voice in their housing preferences, and we would like to make sure that house counselors and cluster deans are able to build dorm spaces that are inclusive and welcoming.”\nThe current housing process has been built upon for many years, differing from time to time, to ensure that all students have a fair chance when choosing their future dorm. \n“As a freshman dealing with the house lottery was pretty stressful and a little frustrating, but I got very lucky and ended up in my favorite and one of the nicest dorms. I think that the lottery system is very fair since it is a lottery; you just pick a number and it is completely random and unbiased,” said Michelle Koh ’17.\nNatalie Warren ’18 said, “It’s very luck-based, which puts a lot of pressure on which number you pull and it can get a little dicey in terms of the selection process. In the end, if you’re lucky, it’s fair.”\n“[However,] in an ideal world, everyone would get what they want, but ideal worlds don’t necessarily exist and aren’t necessarily possible.

After several nights of walking through northern Turkey, and two years of laborious waiting, she was finally granted entrance to the United States.\nMohammed shared her experience leaving Syria and transitioning to life in Lawrence, Massachusetts at “Alliance with Aleppo,” a vigil and fundraiser co-hosted by Out of the Blue and Andover High School’s Diversity Club. The vigil sought to highlight the human aspect of the refugee crisis and to educate students about the effort made by community members to fight the problem, explained Cindy Espinosa ’18, a board member of Out of the Blue.\n“I hope the Andover community takes away that [the refugee crisis] is a real issue and that there are people behind the word ‘refugees’.… I just think it’s more personal and inspiring when you hear from first-hand experiences,” said Espinosa.\nAfter finishing high school in Syria, Mohammed was unable to continue her studies due to the violent climate in the country. Her father eventually decided to move her family to the United States to protect her.\n“It’s very dangerous living there. [We] don’t have work, [we] don’t have money, [we] don’t have anything in my country”, said Mohammed during her presentation.\nMohammed’s family lived in Turkey for two years before they were vetted to immigrate. During this time period, Mohammed had to work twelve hours a day to cover the expensive cost of living in Turkey where she was left with little time to study. Her family resettled in the United States with the help of the International Institute of New England (IINE), an organization that resettles refugees in the greater Boston area. Mohammed’s inability to speak English made it difficult to resettle initially.\n“Resettlement is not easy at all, but I think the language barrier is one of the biggest obstacles because that actually is what prevents [the refugees] from getting jobs, too. And jobs are what they need for them to survive,” said Aneela Qureshi Rafiq, a volunteer at IINE, during the vigil.\nIINE serves hundreds of other families in the Boston area. Their programs include a ninety-day resettlement period where the clients’ rent and fees are paid for, community and cultural orientations are offered, and participants receive job training. However, IINE’s reach has been limited due to a shortage of monetary resources and recent executive orders from the Trump administration.\n“[After the Executive Orders], there is a ceiling on the funding now. The funding is going to decrease because they will not be able to welcome as many refugees. And a lot of the programs they had put into place prior to the ban, they are still going, but that money is not going to be there,” said Qureshi Rafiq.\nHalf of the funds raised at the vigil will be donated to IIEA, and the other half will go to White Helmet, an organization of volunteer rescue workers aiding in Syria to provide emergency medical assistance in the aftermath of airstrikes. Lilia Cai-Hurteau, Instructor of Chinese, is active in organizing multiple drives for refugee families and encourages students to be involved in the cause after the vigil.\n“There are so many causes out there, so many organizations that need help now. I would just encourage people to focus on maybe one particular organization that’s closer to heart that they can make a difference,” said Cai-Hurteau.\nBlake Campbell ’18, an attendee of the vigil, believes that students should take more action to address issues directly.\n“Something that often frustrates me about social justice particularly here on campus is that we do an excellent job to make people aware of what is going on, but I don’t think we do well with actually performing the services that people really need… I think what we need to do and what is accomplished today is letting people to know what needs to happen and how to contribute,” said Campbell.\n\n', 'Mar 31, 2017'), ('\nAndover’s Marine Sciences Club competed in the Blue Lobster Bowl, advancing to the semifinals but eventually losing to Lexington’s A team, finishing eighth overall.

The event is designed as a test run before the official event next year, where participants will aim to package one million meals.\n“The goal of our event is to bring our community together. It’s a great way to meet each other [and] for students and faculty to get to know one another… We’re holding it two weeks before finals week. Those are busy weeks, and we think it’s really important to build a sense of community… while also being Non Sibi and helping one another,” said Sundaram. \nMost of the meals will go to Haiti, where hurricanes and other natural disasters have recently occurred. Sundaram was initially inspired to organize the event after prior experiences working as a food packaging volunteer in California and recent experiwences learning about the refugee crisis in the Middle East. \n“I went to a Non Sibi event in California, where we meal-packaged. I had so much fun that day, and I remember forming really strong friendships with the people who were there. At the same time, I have been reading a lot about Syria and the refugees who don’t have food, are in dire need, and dying. I thought that we could combine them, so a meal-packaging event was perfect,” said Sundaram.\nTo organize the test trial in May and the the larger event next year, Sundaram recruited a task force of Andover students to assist in writing grants and greater community outreach and publicization. Carley Kukk ’19, Head of Fundraising, also had previous experiences with food-packaging events that inspired her to participate in this project. \n“I participated in a lot of food-packaging events with my dad. It’s been part of my life, and I went to one every year. But when I came to Andover, I missed a lot of them. So when [Sundaram] came to me with this idea, I really wanted to be a part of it,” said Kukk.\nSundaram believes that a major challenge facing the task force is fundraising to pay for the cost of the event and meals.\n“We need to raise close to 3,000 dollars… another challenge is recruiting the students to come and participate and inviting them in. In order to fundraise, we’re allowing parents, students, and teachers to sponsor meals. So for just 15 dollars, you can sponsor 50 meals. If you sponsor, your name will be on a box,” said Sundaram.\nJennifer Lee ’18, Chair of the Grant Committee, was recruited by Sundaram for help with writing grant proposals and was inspired to participate in the event through her commitment to Non Sibi values. Lee believes that events like the food packaging event planned for May will help the greater community raise awareness for and rally around issues of hunger and food shortages in many areas of the world. \n“What we… aim as a project to accomplish is to not only raise awareness of this issue but also mobilize other students to take part in an event that’s really rooted in the values of community building… It’s a way for more students… to further their awareness of what it means to be a global citizen and to acknowledge the fact that each individual on this campus has the potential and the power to really affect someone else’s life,” said Lee. \nThe team is working with the charity Stop Hunger Now, who will help them with the logistics once they have completed their goal of raising 3,000 dollars. They are especially focused on encouraging student and community participation when planning this event.\n“We want people to sign up because it’s a really fun event and it’s something that can bring the whole Andover community together… It’s a great way to try and tackle hunger… We’re also planning on having a bake sale sometime in May, so I think that will be fun for some people outside of the community to bring in some goods.

Floors will not be separated by gender, and although bedrooms will serve as more private spaces, common rooms will be open to all as public spaces. Romantic or sexual relationships between dormmates would be explicitly banned, and visitors to bedrooms would only be allowed during supervised visiting hours. According to Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, house counselors and residents would most likely have agency in determining the rules for intra-dorm room visits between students of different genders, though policies have yet to be defined.\nHead of School John Palfrey wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “This decision is completely consistent with our efforts to support all our students equitably and to create an inclusive community. We want all Andover students to feel welcome, known, valued, and at home in our community. We have had transgender students on our campus for a number of years and we have always sought to provide the best environment we can for everyone. This pilot responds to what we have heard from our students and extends our commitment to equity and inclusion in a sensible way.”\nAccording to Elliott, the school would work closely and communicate with the families of students who would wish to live in all-gender housing. Elliott has already received applications from students and faculty members interested in living in all-gender housing.\n“It’s going to be a space, I think, that we hope will model for the rest of our residential community how to have really communicative, really trusting, really clear and intentional expectations about how students interact with each other and how they interact with the house counselors in their dorms. That’s going to be important. We have a student who’s already come forward about applying to be a proctor in this space, so that’s awesome, that there’s already a sense of leadership in a space like this, which is fantastic,” said Elliott.\nKarissa Kang ’17 was the first to introduce the idea of all-gender housing during her Brace Fellowship in the fall of 2015, laying out a plan for the sustainable implementation of a mixed-gender dorms on campus. Afterwards, Kang reached out to several classmates whom she thought would be interested in the new living opportunity.\nAfter five students of various gender approached the administration asking for permission to “stack” (apply with a group to live in a specific dorm) a small dorm last spring, a faculty task force led by Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English, and Jill Thompson, Director of Admissions, was assembled and began work in the fall of 2016: building a proposal to present before the Board of Trustees.\n“It definitely is an important moment though really I think it stems from necessity more than anything else. It’s definitely not a political statement. Andover isn’t segregating by gender in the dorms because that would be almost the same thing. It reinforces the binary anyway… Even when I crafted the terminology, I wanted it to be more accessible for more people so that its not co-ed. It’s not for two genders. It’s for all genders,” said Kang.\n“[The proposal] is very much retrofitted to Phillips Academy… We couldn’t really export this to some other school because they’d have to do their own process. It needs to be flexible because Phillips Academy changes every year with every new crop of students that it gets,” said Staffaroni.\nDiscussions with the board originally began in the Spring Term of last year, but an official proposal from faculty and students was delayed in order to develop the plan further and focus on reforming gendered housing policies for faculty members, who were previously given advantages in the housing bidding process if their genders matched the gender of the dormitory. This year, all faculty members have equal opportunities to move into any large dorm, regardless of gender.\nIn keeping with the administration’s efforts to promote inclusivity for gender nonconforming students, applications for the 2016-2017 school year were the first that allowed students to opt to be placed in the dorm of the gender they identify as, regardless of assignment at birth, according to Elliott.\n“That was a really important step that we made in the admissions process, when we allowed for a self-identify part of the [application]… We’ve done this type of need assessment in so many ways, whether it has to do with a financial need, whether it has to do with an academic need, whether it has to do with a physical or a mental or emotional need. I think that we try to be pretty responsive in that way. We feel like that’s really consistent practices,” said Elliott.\nMembers of the planning committee also worked alongside staff and students from Phillips Exeter Academy who are working on a similar initiative. The task force met once on campus and once at Exeter for conversations about the similar challenges that they would face during implementation on the respective campuses. \nAn application for admission to all-gender housing was released in an email along with general dormitory placement information for next year. Students have the option of applying either as a person with a “self-identified need” or as an “ally or trusted advocate.” \nJack Hjerpe ’17, who served as a member of the student task force, believes that the option of all-gender housing on campus would give genderqueer students the support they need to feel comfortable in their living space on campus.\n“Living in a single-gender dorm, in my own experience, there are times when it’s hard on someone who is not your classic guy. I can only imagine what it would be like if your actual gender did not align with the gender of the dorm you are living and the gender of the people you are living around. The point of a dorm like this is [that] non-binary students deserve to be represented and empowered by their dorm community in the same way that every [cisgender] student does, too,” said Hjerpe.\nMoving forward, no dorms have been designated to be a part of next year’s all-gender housing program. \xa0Students and dorms will be matched together based on the community’s demonstrated need using the same process as the typical residential placement. \n“I’m really excited. I feel like this is a step at Andover that makes me feel really proud to be part of this community.

The evening’s blizzard deposited over a foot of snow that had accumulated on the paths within a few hours.\nFirst and second period were cancelled by the PA Storm Team due to safety concerns posed by the heavy snowfall. Boarders were given the late start, while day students and some faculty received more time to get onto campus.\n“This particular storm, the timing of it, where it was so much snow expected overnight, and heavy snow because the temperature was high enough that [the snow] was going to be really heavy to move, the concern mostly was that our grounds team that was working all night would not have the paths cleared in time and the buildings cleared in time for 8:00 a.m.,” said Patricia Russell, Dean of Studies and Instructor in Biology and member of the PA Storm Team.\nLed by Christopher Joel, Director of Business Services, the members of the PA Storm Team communicate with each other and the school to facilitate the clearing of snow on campus. Composed by a mix of faculty and administrators, the PA Storm Team coordinates with the Office of Physical Plant (OPP) and Phillips Academy Public Safety (PAPS) to ensure the safety of the community.\n“There’s a group of us who discuss… how we’re going to proceed with calling people and [helping] people going home… PAPS, Public Safety, is here 24/7, even in the worst of weather. So here, we’re essential personnel. So we have to be here, much like the police department [has] to be down there. We’re not sworn officers, but we have a sense of duty and obligation to the school and the school community,” said Thomas Conlon, Director of Public Safety.\nDespite the historically difficult winter weather in New England, Andover has had very few snow days in the past. The most notable were during the Ice Storm of 1921, the Blizzard of 1978, and the record-breaking snowfall in 2015. According to the Andover Newsroom, the winter of 2015 topped the record of the Blizzard of 1978 with 50 inches of snow over the course of two weeks.\n“It’s just the weather is unpredictable, but the nice thing here is that with all the people who are living here, as well as an incredible grounds team, things get cleaned up really fast. It’s really dependent on the student shoveling — that makes a huge difference for safety and that’s the thing that we’re worried about most, is keeping students safe. So between the grounds team and all the students and faculty who live here shoveling, we get things cleaned up pretty quickly,” said Russell.\nBesides the increase in snow-shoveling, the recent snow on campus has caused difficulties among the day students at Andover. A common sentiment among days students is that their commute to campus has become more treacherous. Last week, with the sudden snow storm and dangerous roads, some day students missed school, while others were accommodated in dorms to sleep overnight.\n“As a day student, snow makes it very difficult to get to school, especially when [Andover] is so reluctant to give us a snow day. Even with delays and stuff it can make it really difficult because I usually have to plan out whether I’m going to stay on campus for the night or something,” said Sarika Rao ’19.\n\n', 'Feb 17, 2017'), ('\n“Happiness, confidence, self-love, connections, hope, and health” These were the traits that audience members, who gathered in Kemper Auditorium last Thursday, considered to be most important for childhood development. Contrary to their expectations, however, the audience admitted how most school curriculums were centered around teaching students “survival.”\nHalf-way around the globe in the bushes of Victoria, South-Eastern Australia, Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding and day school, has embraced the idea of “positive education,” which, according to the school’s website, is an education method that promotes growth and learning through positive reinforcement. \nThe current principal Stephen Meek, who has assumed role in 2004 after a career working in schools at England, shared his experience pioneering Positive Education last Thursday at Kemper Auditorium, highlighting how the curriculum’s focus on a person’s well-being allow students to flourish. \nMeek said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Positive education and positive psychology… [is] all about trying to help students cope with the kind of stresses that they [meet]… It might be stress from exams, it might be the breakup of a family… whatever it is, all of us will face issues in our life.”\n“[For instance,] before the year 12 exams, we offer them meditation exercises with staff so that [students] can actually go into exams with a calm frame of mind,” he continued. \nAt one point during the presentation Meek displayed a slide on which he misspelled the word “character.” He then pointed out that all the other words on the slide were spelt correctly and that the audience should instead have noted that. He choose to do this to highlight the power of recognizing people’s strengths as opposed to their weaknesses.\nAt Geelong Grammar School, positive education is a whole school approach. All the adults on campus, from teachers to other faculty to gardeners, are given training in positive education, even if they do not interact with students in their work on a daily basis. \nClasses are also offered to alumni and local community members. During the pilot stage of the program, a number of teachers from the surrounding public schools were invited to take part in lessons.\nAmy Patel, Medical Director, said “Having been introduced to this concept many years ago, It’s a very interesting model that I hope we might, explore and take certain aspects. It’s a very individualized type of a process but a lot of concepts resonate with us.”\n“Actually hearing it from the person who was instrumental in bringing [positive education] to his own school was pretty impactful. And then exposing that to other people, I was excited to have so many colleagues be part of the conversation,” she continued. \nPositive education has also been taught to younger people and children in various age-appropriate manners. Meek described a project undertaken by elementary schoolers called “Catch a Kindness.” Whenever a student saw a classmate doing something kind, they would write it down on a butterfly and put it into the class net, and then at the end of the week the teacher would sit down and read all the kind acts that had been done, providing recognition for good behavior. \nThese positive education lessons are not reserved for such young minds. Meek spoke on another school tradition, gratitude letters. Students were tasked with writing an authentic letter to express heartfelt thanks. Once they were done with this they would then go to the recipient and read it out loud to them. At the presentation, a video was played where a girl described receiving a letter from her brother, and how much of a shock it was to her. But that in the end it was meaningful, as he did not often communicate what she meant to him. \nAnother aspect of positive education was the implementation of one building that encompassed the medical, physiological, and sports facilities into one building, an idea that bears a strong resemblance to Andover’s own Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center.\nWill Orben, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, said, “It was a great reminder of how important it is to focus on the things you’re doing well and to really focus on techniques you can use to emphasize people’s strengths.”\nOverall, Meek expressed being happy at the outcome and would do the whole process again. At the conclusion of his presentation Meek said, “I think we’ve got students who enjoy what they do, not every day, but actually feel more connected and have the skills to take them further into the future, the institute is something we setup to enable us to spread it, as far as we can, and I think for us it’s a really joyful part of how we are a school, ensuring that what we have we can share in a wider way, so for us the whole thing has worked really well.”\n\n', 'Feb 17, 2017'), ('\nAs the culmination of over a year of preparation, Trevor Lazar ’17, one of this year’s Brace Fellows, presented his thoughts and findings on his research into the trafficking of underaged girls in the United States. During one of the talk’s most powerful moments, Lazar explained how every year 200,000 children are victims of sex trafficking in the U.S., and nearly 98 percent of them are female. \nBefore applying for a Brace Fellowship, Lazar worked for several months as a research intern at The Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research at Arizona State University’s School of Social Work. For his faculty advisors, Lazar was supported by Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life and Instructor in History, and Flavia Vidal, Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and Instructor in English, in writing a research paper summarizing his findings. Lazar also prepared a final presentation, entitled “Lives Gamed: The Challenges Facing Underage Homeless Female Victims of Sex Trafficking in the United States.” His talk aimed to analyze and spread awareness of the specific challenges facing underage homeless female victims of sex trafficking as well as highlight constructive measures that will need to be implemented on a wider scale by law enforcement and governing bodies to solve the current problem.\n“As defined by the federal government, sex trafficking entails a commercial sex act induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age. So essentially, sex trafficking is when a pimp, otherwise known as a trafficker, forces a victim into prostitution through means of violence, coercion, dependency, or even romance,” said Lazar.\nOne of the stories Lazar came across in his research was of a girl referred to as “Anne” in a story published by “The New York Times” in 2013. “Anne” had run away from home after facing repeated sexual abuse from a family member and accepted an offer to live with an older man in his home in New York City. The man started a relationship with her and later began abusing her, sexually assaulting her, and forcing her to sell sex for his profit.\n“Her daily routine, by the end of this, consisted of: she would get up, get beaten by her trafficker, she would then go out into the streets, sell sex for a few hours, she’d return home, the trafficker would take all the money she’d earned, [and] she [would] get beaten again [and] sexually assaulted again,” said Lazar.\nIn his presentation Lazar pointed out that “Anne’s” story reflects that of a typical victim of sex trafficking. Often, victims are young children who have run away from home due to sexual abuse or some other kind of sexual abuse and find themselves at the mercy of sex traffickers. The younger the runaway is, the more likely he or she will be vulnerable to being approached by a sex trafficker. According to one statistic, one in three runaways will be approached by a trafficker within 48 hours, explained Lazar.\n“I thought it was interesting how [Lazar] focused on minor sex-trafficking as opposed to regular sex-trafficking in general. I never considered how the process or situation is different for minors but he talked a lot about the correlation between run-aways and getting caught-up in sex-trafficking…I thought it was an interesting…and felt a personal [connection],” said Leeza Petrov ’18, an attendant to Lazar’s presentation.\nTraffickers know how to exploit victims’ previous traumas. In addition, traffickers also aim to create a dependence so that victims rely on them in some way and are not able to leave, whether this be through offering food and shelter or forced usage of drugs and alcohol.\nLazar said, “In situations where the victim has experienced a broken family or familial abuse of some form, traffickers will attempt to create an environment seemingly conducive to a family structure. Pimps often force their victims to refer to the pimp as ‘daddy’ and they will also force the victims… to call each other ‘wifey’ or ‘sister-in-law.’ They will literally forbid them from using their actual names to remove agency from victims… This is especially amplified if the victim is runaway, homeless, living in poverty, that can amplify the extent to which they might be dependent on the trafficker.”\nLazar continued by explaining that the detrimental effects of sex trafficking are not only limited to physical harm caused by violence, but also extend to infection with Sexually Transmitted Illnesses (STIs) and the development of mental health conditions.\n“Half of the victims contract STIs, and I think some 40 percent are diagnosed with some mental health condition of some sort and so the effects are devastating…” said Lazar.\nLazar argues that combatting sex trafficking starts on a small scale by making it less acceptable for people to call sex ads and educating the greater population about the negative effects of sex trafficking.\n“I think that having a basic understanding of things such as consent, affirmative consent, and really adopting feminism and taking that applying it to any aspect of your living life is a really good starting point because the more that we change the culture surrounding [sex trafficking] the less likely it is that the potential buyer [for] prostitution would actually go forth with the actual [deal],” said Lazar. \n\n', 'Feb 17, 2017'), ('\nAccompanied by Andover’s Drumline and chanting Janelle Monae’s “Hell You Talm ‘Bout” with high spirits, the Andover community came together on Sunday for a Black Lives Matter Vigil to commemorate the African-American\xa0 lives lost to police brutality.\nThe march was led by Drumline and Blue Key Heads Auguste White ’17 and Brandon Barros ’17 along with Af-Lat Am board members JayShawn Fuller ’17 and Emily Ndiokho ’18, and CAMD Director LaShawn Springer. The march started at the steps of Paresky Commons and ended at Cochran Chapel.\nAt the culmination of the march, participants entered the chapel for a reading of the names of the black lives lost to the police accompanied a moment of silence for each victim, a spoken word poetry performance by Justice Robinson ’18, and a speech given by Keely Aouga ’19 and Ava Stills ’19 on responsible allyship with marginalized communities. \n“I hope the performance made people think about the historical context of why black lives matter and how they are being threatened… I think Andover students can take the time and listen and that in itself is an action towards being a better activist or ally,” said Robinson in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe vigil was planned as one of a variety of events organized by Andover’s Afro-Latino-American Society (Af-Lat-Am), to observe Black History Month. \nLopez was particularly affected by the moment of silence held to commemorate the lives lost to police brutality. \n“My favorite part was the moment of silence because it gave me time to reflect and realize how much more work we have to do for equality but it was beautiful being in the chapel and seeing so many people supporting the cause,” Lopez continued.\nKeely Aouga ’19, an Af-Lat Am board member, believes that the vigil was a good opportunity for building community across a diverse range of identities in the Andover community.\n “With the election, it’s been really hard for people of color, or just any groups of marginalized people to feel like they matter or feel like they belong, and coming here is like seeing all these people that have come in support and…you know that you’re not alone and that you do matter,” said Aouga on the vigil’s relevance to current events.\nAbigail Ndikum ’20 was inspired to attend the event as a way to express the unacceptability of current societal injustices, and emphasize the necessity of action in response to injustice.\n“They said almost 250 names of those that have been killed or oppressed, basically, and it should never be that high, that’s not fair. So I think people should take away that we need to make a difference, if we see something wrong we have to make a change, we have to speak out.

Andover put in a request for demolition of the building to the Andover Preservation Commission on January 10. Located directly next to Tucker House, Blanchard House used to be a small dormitory and residence to a faculty family.\nHeavy snowfalls in the winter of 2014-2015 severely damaged the structure and the carrying beams of the house.\n“The residents noticed cracks in some interior walls… We found a number of cracked and failing main support beams, so we relocated the family,”\xa0 wrote Larry Muench, Director of Facilities at the Office of Physical Plant, in an email to The Phillipian, \nThe building has also been moved twice, once in 1858 and again in 1928. It’s original location on Salem Street was behind Paresky Commons and near Benner House. These moves are suspected to have caused additional damage to the house’s structure. Blanchard House was thoroughly examined by Andover town’s building inspector who declared the building unsafe.\nThe decision to demolish Blanchard House as opposed to repairing it comes from the high budget estimates. After the thorough inspection, the estimated costs for repair started at 1.5 million dollars and only increased from that point. Over the last 15 years Andover has already spent over 500,000 dollars in improving the house.\n“I’m sad to lose such an historic building, but I’m in favor of demolition… I feel we could rebuild a new structure on the same location that is energy efficient, sustainable, and safe,” said Muench.\nThe official press release included that, “the school will make a formal request to demolish Blanchard House at a public hearing before the Andover Preservation Commission on February 14. If approved, the school aims to complete demolition this March.”\nBlanchard House is one of the earliest surviving buildings in Andover and is listed in the Academy Hill Historic District as a historic place.

Black History Month is observed annually in the United States and Canada in February, but in the United Kingdom it is observed in October. The month aims to commemorate important people and events in black history.\nAf-Lat-Am kicked off the month with screenings of “Fruitvale Station” and “I Can Do Bad All By Myself” as well as a “Luke Cage” marathon. In addition, Af-Lat-Am will host a Black Arts Coffeehouse, a Black Arts Regional dance, a Drama Lab about Martin Luther King Jr. and the night before his death, a reading by poet Nate Marshall, an assortment of faculty speakers, and a vigil for black victims of police brutality.\nKeely Aouga ’19, a board member of Af-Lat-Am, said, “Many of the things we’re doing aren’t like lectures… people watch movies and then they can learn from the movie. Also, especially last year, the Coffeehouse was a big hit with many people, and it was the black students on campus showing parts of their art. So, from that people can see… a part of who we are. And [there are] faculty members speak- ing… [and] if these are your teachers, of course you want to know what they’re saying or their thoughts on things so hopefully that will also draw many people.”\nAouga believes that the events Af-Lat-Am has planned for this month are important because they acknowledge and celebrate the achievements of people who have contributed to the legacy of the United States. She stated that celebrating black history is a way of showing that the successes and contributions of all people matter.\n“I think [black history] is important to remember because America was built off of\xa0slaves. And to ignore the history of black people is to ignore all the work that the ancestors of black people have done to contribute to this country… It’s always important to acknowledge the people who have contributed to where we are now, especially people of color, in this case black people. Usually, as people of color, your success is either not appreciated or it’s ignored. We always have to pay attention,” said Aouga.\n\n\nAva Stills ’19, another board member of Af-Lat-Am, hopes that the events this month will draw students from all different backgrounds. She explained that the goal of this month is helping students have a better understanding of and appreciation for the achievements and struggles of the black community.\n“We want… people [to] feel comfortable coming… it’s not just for a select group of people…We try and stress the fact that you don’t have to identify with something to be a part of it and to care about it. First of all, it affects you in ways that you don’t really know about and you probably have never thought about. But even when it doesn’t affect you really strongly, it still should matter to you… it’s okay to care about issues that aren’t necessarily yours. Our goal is [for students] to have a better understanding of something that isn’t necessarily theirs, and if it is theirs, to appreciate it more,” said Stills.\nIn past years, Andover has celebrated Black History Month solely with Black Arts Weekend. By planning events for the entire month of February, Af-Lat-Am intends to take advantage of the opportunity of the entire month to honor the achievements of black people.\nAouga said, “It’s called Black History Month and we wanted to take advantage of that month, especially because we don’t have a lot of time throughout the year where we get to have a lot of events in honor of black people.”\n“[Black history] should matter more than just a weekend, it should be bigger than that,” Stills said.\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nWellness Week, a long-standing staple of winter term that had been in play since 2010 and focused on presenting programs on health promotion and risk reduction, has been removed from this year’s academic calendar. This decision was reached last year by Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-Director of Wellness Education, and Carol Israel, Instructor of Psychology.\nAccording to Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, efforts that once went towards developing the “crash course week” will be concentrated on more long-term programs. This includes the Foundations Empathy and Balance Curriculum for Juniors, required PACE classes for Lowers, and weekend wellness activities such as Zumba, Yoga, and Tai Chi.\n“We hope our sustained, consistent, regular programming will help our community shift habits and adopt healthy behaviors that are sustainable,” wrote Elliott in an email to The Phillipian.\nIn addition, numerous institutions such as the Brace Center, the Rebecca M.

We want to make sure that students can engage in the events we have scheduled, and allow adequate time to process and reflect on the events we have planned,” wrote Patel in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe removal of Wellness Week has also been attributed to negative student feedback regarding the lack of time available to reflect on the issues discussed.\n“We completely agree [with the feedback], and we are working on spreading out the programming\xa0and offering sessions afterwards to allow for discussion, reflection, and conversation,” said Patel.\n\n\n\n“We acknowledge that a week to discuss wellness is insufficient, and prefer that wellness education is spread throughout the year. We are making great progress in that direction, and will continue to seek student feedback and participation in our ongoing wellness education efforts,” Patel continued.\nTraditionally, Wellness Week took place during the middle of Winter Term. Students were given several days off from classes to attend workshops, performances, and speeches meant to promote mental and physical health. Originally, the content was focused around alcohol and chemical dependency but later expanded to encompass topics ranging from depression to sports psychology.\n“The people who are devel- oping the program are doing a good job making [Wellness Week] a more consistent, year-long approach,” said Kathryn McQuade, Instructor in English and house counselor in Nathan Hale House.\nGerardo Segura ’18 appreciates the positive effects Wellness Week has had on him in the past.\n“I think one of the most important things is just the idea of having a Wellness Week on campus. The school shows initiative towards actually caring for student wellness, not just physically, but in other ways. Since we’re in such high-stress environment, I really appreciate efforts to keep students healthy both mentally and physically,” said Segura.\n\n\nSome students, however, agree with a long-term approach when talking about these kinds of issues.\n“In-depth and substantial discussions should be explored within the school throughout the course of a year,” said Junah Jang ’20.\nLior Hirschfeld ’17 said, “I felt like [Wellness Week] ended up, for me, almost more stressful than normal weeks. Although the activities themselves… were really relaxing or really interesting and engaging a lot of the time, just the amount of time that they took up from the schedule ended up making it harder to fit all of your work into the week.”\nJenni Lord ’19 appreciates the decision made by the administration.\n“I think there’s definitely enough topics [that the school dis- cusses], but the processing times are not enough. [There’s also] just a lot of stress… and I did find, ironically, that teachers give way too much homework during wellness week. The fact that nobody likes it, it’s good that the school’s responsive to that,” said Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nR.Prem/The Phillipian\nWithin months of arriving on campus as a new Lower, Louis Aaron ’18 already had plans for finding a way to provide students their own industrial-grade t-shirt printer. After receiving an Abbot Academy Association (AAA) Grant for 18,000 dollars last fall, Aaron’s plan was realized and the new printer can now be found in the basement of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. The t-shirt printer will be available to all students and faculty on campus for any purpose including club, dorm, or sports apparel.\n“The printer is essentially a colored printer for t-shirts. It works almost in the same way as a paper colored printer and the process… is pretty simple. You just take a shirt on the tray, upload a design, and press the big blue button. It goes in [and] a print head goes back and forth and prints a colored image on the shirt,” said Aaron.\nThe printer can print on any surface, including t-shirts, sweatshirts, and tote bags, however it works best on cotton. The prices for each item depend on the type and color of the surface, and the type and amount of ink used. A t-shirt is estimated to cost around ten dollars. The cost of the printer is cheaper than ordering online and will also be more accessible to the community, cutting down shipping costs and saving time. A brief training session is required to use the printer, but its usage will be open to anyone on campus.\n“Apparel is really part of the culture at Andover…[It] does create a sense of unity among the\xa0members. [It’s] a physical item [that creates] a strong image for you… I think Girl Up would benefit from having t-shirts because a big part of Girl Up is spreading awareness about the club itself,” said Leah Adelman ’17, president of Girl Up, an advocacy club that promotes basic human rights for girls in developing countries.\n\n\n\nAaron originally had the idea to advocate for a t-shirt printer when he was a freshman at his previous high school in Phoenix, Arizona. After creating t-shirts and selling them to students to raise money for his math club, he realized the expensive cost of the process and wanted to have a faster, more cost-effective way to create apparel.\n“I wasn’t the only one printing shirts and I knew it was super expensive…and I was like ‘man, this school could really benefit from people having t-shirt printers…’ ” said Aaron.\nThe printer, however, is not meant to completely replace ordering apparel form online companies. For large orders, those over 60 items, Aaron recommend using an outside printing company instead. Still, Sam Bloom ’18, the graphic designer for the club, says the printer could still help for orders that have already been outsourced.\n“Let’s say your cluster orders apparel, [which is a] huge quantity… Let’s say you missed out on ordering. You could get the design and print it yourself for probably, if not the same cost, if not even cheaper,” said Bloom.\nJeffrey Shen ’19 who was also part of the development team said, “On the team, I’m the web site designer so I handle taking care of the technology and also designing the website that people can reserve times on.”\n\n\nThe printer can print on t-shirts, long sleeves, tote bags, towels, and more.\n\n\n\xa0To address these problems,\xa0the team hopes to use special cartridges that contain a special solution or to recruit day students to take care of the printer. They think that using and maintaining the printer could become a community effort.\nMoney made from the printer will go towards new ink, shirts, and saving up for a new printer for when the time comes to replace this one.\n“I want to make it clear this isn’t something for us [alone] to benefit from. This is literally us providing the campus with something that could be really cool,” said Bloom.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information, and Library Services, is the faculty member who aided Aaron with this project. In addition to using the printer for apparel, he hopes to use it for advocacy and art.\n“Louis had this somewhat wacky idea, but the more math and financial analysis he showed me, the more his idea made sense. I signed on to be his faculty advisor for his AAA grant request. He was turned down the first time, but he showed great resiliency and resolve, reworked his grant, and succeeded the second time around. I love when students have ideas and work to see them come to pass,” said\xa0Barker.\n\n\nThe team hopes to be able to\xa0keep the printer up and running two weeks every month. They are hoping to find a different location as its current room does not have the correct ventilation for the chemicals used to prime t-shirts for printing. The team plans to use the faculty lounge in the basement of the library as the printer’s permanent location. It is a large space with windows and proper ventilation.\nLouis expects that the biggest challenge will be the daily maintenance the requires. The ink cartridges have to be shaken daily to prevent them from drying up, and other aspects of the printer need to be routinely checked. Maintenance will become difficult during long breaks when students leave campus.\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nInspired by research programs offered by institutions such as BRACE and CAMD, Clementene Clayton ’18, Grace Limoncelli ’18, Fredericka Lucas ’18, and Hannah Zhang ’18 created the “Sykes Scholars,” a program that allow Andover students to explore the medical field through hands-on experiences, independent research, and peer collaboration.\nBrought together by their interests in health and medicine, the four wanted a way for high school students to learn about different careers in the medical world. Since then, the four have been working on the Sykes Scholars program under the guidance of Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director at the Sykes Wellness Center.\n“Essentially, we thought that there wasn’t really an outlet for students to do scientific research outside of an intense Biology-600 setting, and we wanted to make that opportunity available to students who just wanted to do scientific research and to learn from other students,” said Lucas.\nPatel said, “They had been percolating this idea for a while amongst themselves… and they really wanted to marry their interests in science with primarily an interest in health and health professions and research.”\nCurrently, the four students have been volunteering at Lawrence General Hospital on Sundays. For three hours a day, the Sykes Scholars assist\xa0the hospital workers in various wards and observe how the workers interact with their patients. From organizing birth certificates to simply talking with the patients, this hands-on work is a large part of the Sykes Scholars program.\n\n\n“Going to a hospital was a really important experience to have, especially since a lot of the people going into the medical field end up working in hospitals as either doctors, surgeons, nurses, anesthesioogists, you know, a lot of different careers… So we thought that it would be a really valuable experience to be able to go to a hospital and kind of see how everything works,” said Zhang.\n“I work in the ER, and not only is it great to help out where I can but also seeing a glimpse of the inner workings of a hospital is fascinating. Honestly, at our age, it can be a bit difficult to really start to get a feel for what something in the medical field could really look like. Volunteering really lets you get into the nitty gritty parts of it,” wrote Clayton in an email to The Phillipian.\nWhile they work on their specific projects, the Sykes Scholars are working to further refine the program’s curriculum. The current curriculum aims to give students a perspective into the medical world using non-traditional methods outside of the classroom. The topics covered in the curriculum will span over four main categories, from learning about modern medicine to speaking with experts.\n\n\n\n\nIn the future, Clayton, Limoncelli, Lucas, and Zhang will all become mentors for the future group of Sykes Scholars, so that student collaboration becomes an ingrained part of the program. With applications coming out later this February, the Sykes Scholars hope that the program will be successful in allowing a few students to delve deeper into subjects that are not necessarily learned in a classroom environment.\n“What I really love is that the students are shaping and defining what this program is. And now, we’ll have this first group of Sykes Scholars that\n\n\ncan be role models to next year’s Sykes scholars. I think that’s a pretty unique feature of a program that involves independent study, and one that can be incredibly impactful. So I hope that it can continue to be that mentorship from students and for students,” said Patel.\nThrough constant changes and improvements to the program, the Sykes Scholars hope that the program will make an impact on the health and well-being of the Andover community. Despite the challenge of creating an entire curriculum from scratch, the scholars are working hard\xa0to make the curriculum as open-ended to future students as possible.\n\n\n“There have definitely been quite a few bumps on the road as we develop this program, and I am sure there will be many more to come. That’s what makes doing things like this interesting… Also, we wanted to make sure that the program allowed for the full spectrum of interests that can be found in medicine. We didn’t want to just talk about physicians or hospitals, because, really, medicine is much more broad than that,” wrote Clayton in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nS.Bloom/The Phillipian\nFollowing a decade-long tradition that promotes the pursuit of environmental sustainability, the EcoAction Club and Allison Guerette, Campus Sustainability Coordinator, launched the annual interscholastic Green Cup Challenge this past Wednesday.\nThe Green Cup Challenge, a month-long energy conservation competition between Andover, Deerfield, Choate, and St. Paul’s, stems from last year’s Gunga Energy Challenge — a shorter, smaller-scale competition held between Andover dorms.\n“[Andover] is competing against other ESA [Eight Schools Association] schools to reduce the most electricity from school-specific baselines in a month-long challenge, and dormitories are competing against one another to reduce the most\xa0electricity from dormitory-specific baselines in four week-long challenges,” wrote Guerette in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n\n“Ultimately, we all win when the school saves electricity and reduces its carbon footprint,but the EcoAction Club will\xa0also reward the dormitories that conserve the most electricity. Updates will be provided on the screens at Paresky throughout February, and you can follow the dormitory competition on Gunga Data, which is linked from the PAnet homepage,” Guerette continued.\nGherardo Morona ’17, president of the EcoAction club and one of the Green Cup Challenge’s coordinators, contributed to the planning and publicization of the event as well as its student outreach components.\n“The intent for the Green Cup Challenge was to incentivize as many PA students as possible\xa0to develop sustainable habits. We attempted to achieve this through awarding prizes and nurturing a ‘friendly’ competitive spirit between dorms and with our other peer schools,” said Morona.\n\n\n“I hope that this challenge will make students more aware of the impact that they can have as individuals through their daily actions. In the long term,\xa0I hope this will urge students to develop more sustainable habits,” Morona continued.\nChallenge participant and Stevens House resident Jennie Guo ’19 believes that these challenges may make her more mindful of energy usage in the short term, but that frequent reminders may prove more constructive in the long term.\n“I’m normally pretty conscious [of energy usage]… sometimes I leave the lights on by accident but usually I close\xa0them after I’m done with them… I guess it makes me slightly more aware, but I feel like just regular reminders work a lot better than some challenge because personally I feel like I don’t care that much about the challenge, but\xa0I care a lot about the environment,” said Guo.\n\n\n\nArno Min ’19, Bishop Hall resident, views the challenge as\xa0a good first step towards a more concrete change for environmental awareness.\n“I think the challenge will help motivate people towards being more environmentally conscious. However, I also feel like there’s a large population\xa0of students who either are not really involved in the challenge or don’t have a huge interest in the challenge, so in that sense it may not be the most effective… I feel like regular reminders would generally speaking be more effective. But I think this\xa0is good that they’re trying to do this,” said Min.\n\n\nThe competition features\xa0an incentives program with weekly prizes and a celebratory munch awarded to the dorm that consumes the least amount of energy. Dorms such as Hearsey House and Bertha Bailey, which are not equipped with energy tracking software, as well as the day student community, will still be given the chance to win weekly prizes through taking pictures of energy saving actions and sending them to the Campus Sustainability Office.\n“We hope the Green Cup Challenge inspires students to always look for ways to save energy. Small changes (such as unplugging devices when not in use and turning out lights when you leave a room) can collectively make a big difference in saving energy and reducing our carbon footprint,” said Guerette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nAn overwhelming number of students visited the rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center over the past few weeks due to the increasing volume of illnesses: seasonal influenza, viral gastroenteritis, and the common cold. Symptoms of seasonal influenza, also known as the flu, in clude fever, cough, and fatigue which can make it highly contagious. Gastroenteritis has more severe symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever.\n“We’ve had a very small handful of positive flu. There’s a difference between the flu, which is what [students and faculty] got [vaccines] for, and what we saw a large majority of here on campus, which was gastroenteritis. It is a viral gastral bug that we got inundated with about three weeks ago,” said Karina early, a registered nurse at the Wellness Center.\nIn addition to gastroenteritis and the flu, there have also been many cases of a nondescript bug. According to members of the Wellness Center team, the bug acts like a viral illness and its symptoms are similar to those of the common cold, such as a fever and a runny nose. A pattern regarding spikes in illnesses around campus has been defined, with the peaks being around the middle of January continuing to May.\n\n\nNurses at the Wellness Center speculate that the reason behind the quick spreading of gastroenteritis and the common cold is due to close contact with peers, especially in living spaces.\n“When living together, [illness] is going to spread quickly because you’re sharing every thing. [Students and teachers] cohabitate. Just like living in somebody’s house, if you get sick at home, chances are that your brothers and your sisters and your mom and dad [are] also going to get sick,” said Amy\xa0Avery, registered nurse at the Wellness Center.\nAbhinav Tadikonda ’20 considers sickness as a burden to his social and academic life.\n“When I did get a minor sickness, I felt tired all the time, and it was hard for me [to] find the energy to do homework and sports,” said Tadikonda.\nStudents agreed with Tadikonda, stressing that sickness brings disruptions to classes and schoolwork.\n“It just makes you super tired and fatigued, but you know you really can’t miss a class because if you do, you might fall behind. you can’t miss your test, even though you can barely keep yourself awake and focused,” said Britney\xa0Bourassa ’18.\n\n\n\n“I did have a cold and it made it harder to do my homework. When I get sick, it’s just hard to focus,” said Safi Zenger ’20.\nA campus-wide email was sent out by the Wellness Center which highlighted the best course of action for fighting flu season. These steps included staying hydrated, eating healthy, sanitizing hands often, and receiving vaccines. The email also emphasized that getting enough sleep was imperative to a quick recovery.\nSince the Wellness Center only has twelve beds for patients, students living within a two to three-hour driving distance were asked to return home. According to Amy Avery, Registered Nurse, ill students cannot attend school until their fever subsides for 12-24 hours.\n“Students will be in the dorms with illness, as the Well- ness Center is caring for the sicker students. Please be attentive to the attendance system and mossprod alerts [system in place for faculty communication], and check in with your students who are sick to ensure that they are managing (eating, drinking, and resting). Please also check in with roommates and close contacts of sick students,” the email said.\n\n\nStudents are already taking precautions to avoid this year’s spread of illnesses.\n“[To prevent illness] I drink lots of water, sleep, get workouts in, eat fruits and veggies.

When CARE hired its full-time staff attorney, the way we responded to immigration, to the executive orders by Trump, to a whole host of things, [it] totally changed,” said Mazen in his presentation.\nMazen also highlighted the need for people to stand up against racial stereotypes and targeting, including articles and fake news that focus on attacking Muslim culture. educating people about Islam and unreliable media sources can assist in preventing racism and xenophobia.\n“One needs to know how to consume media and how to talk about all kinds of things, but [specifically] ethnic groups, religious groups, security, etcetera, in a very measured, very productive way. It doesn’t help anyone if we’re talking across purposes or if we’re scapegoating people,” said Mazen in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n\n\nMazen’s final step to help the Muslim community was to simply “show up,” which means attending fundraisers, being a reliable ally, and using privilege to help people who are being suppressed.\nAbdelaziz Bahnasy ’17, a member of the Muslim community at Andover, expressed his hope that Mazen’s presentation would help build empathy and lead to progress in the fight to change negative perceptions of Islam.\n“If we can get ourselves to shift our focus from big picture political conversations to those human beings on our level and trying to help those around us were going to be able to make progress,” said Bahnasy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Feb 10, 2017'), ('\n\n\n\nAt the end of the first half of Super Bowl LI, Jack Lee ’20 grew excited at the Atlanta Falcons’ 21-3 lead.

They really pushed me and challenged me to think in new ways, and that was just a really great experience and I’m really grateful for the year I’ve had,” she said.\nChaya Holch ’17 and Jack Twomey ’17, former Managing Editors, will also step down in place of Ananda Kao ’18, former Associate Sports Editor, Serena Ren ’18, former Associate Arts Editor, and Nicholas Toldalagi ’18, former Associate News Editor.\nTwomey said that he will recall his experience managing and working in the newsroom as the best 30 weeks of his life.\n“I’ve enjoyed nearly every minute of it, I’ve met the best people, I’ve been able to be exposed to just some amazing things, and I feel like I really found my home in the newsroom,” said Twomey.\nHolch had confidence in the success of the CXL board and described each member as capable and determined to lead, support, and innovate The Phillipian.\n“I have lots of faith in Serena… Ananda, Nick, in all of [the Upper Management Board], and I really believe that, as a group, they’re going to find a balance that works for them the way our board did, and the way we’ve loved each other I hope that they can love each other the same way and in the ways that they need to be loved and supported by each other, and I think they’ll do that,” she said.\nJB Lim ’18 and Juan Pablo Ramos Barroso ’18, Former Associate News Editors, will be in charge of the News section in place of Candy Chan ’17, Annie Lee ’17 and Susan Yun ’17.\n“Working with Susan and Annie has been absolutely amazing. In my unbiased opinion, I think we’ve been the best News editors so far, in the whole 239 years of Phillipian. But, really, we’ve gotten really close because normally there are like five or four News editors, and it’s only the three of us, so doing all that work together I feel like has really strengthened our friendship,” said Chan.\nLee said, “Getting involved with The Phillipian was really one of the best decisions I made at Andover. Whether it was coming down on Thursday mornings to edit articles or staying up late to finish the news layout, I’ll miss working with Candy, Susan and the associates a lot. They are all so amazing, and I’m lucky to have been a part of this hard-working and motivated group of people.”\nLim and Ramos Barroso will strive to enhance and ‘lede’ the News Section beyond the high bars set by former editors.\nYun said, “I have a lot of faith in our new editors. Hopefully they’ll keep remembering to hide the Gushers. Although I’m biased, I believed the most important section of the paper, News, should have priority over snacks.”\nLauren Lee ’18 and Hannah Zhang ’18, former Associate Arts & Leisure Editors, will now succeed Kalina Ko ’17 and Morgan Kuin ’17 in capturing the aesthetics of Andover.\n“Having worked with Lauren and Hannah since they started writing, Kalina and I are both confident that they will bring plenty of creative and fresh ideas to the paper. We’re excited to see how they will shape and expand Arts and Leisure,” said Kuin.\nKatie Hartzell ’18, Emily Ndiokho ’18, and Adrienne Zhang ’18, former Associate Commentary Editors, will continue their formidable work ethic, friendly leadership skills, and strong writing techniques to inherit the Commentary Section from former editors Sewon Park ’17 and Nancy Kim ’17.\n“It certainly required a lot of patience and hard work to be a commentary editor, and the experience was definitely more about communicating and collaborating with other editors than about editing articles. But in retrospect, it was a good learning experience,” said Kim.\n“Adrienne is a strong writer, Emily communicates effectively with her peers and our writers, and Katie has a solid foundation in English grammar. I have no doubt that they will create a section that our readers will enjoy. I can’t wait to see what they’ll do once CXL really takes on the reigns of the paper,” she continued.\nFormer Associate Sports Editors Anjunae Chandran ’18, Nithish Kalpat ’18, Jennifer Lee ’18, and Reuben Philip ’18 will now lead the Sports Section in even replacement of former Sports Editors Laura Bilal ’17, Cassie Chin ’17, Howard Johnson ’17, and Andrew Zhang ’17. From winter to fall sports, the quartet will report fresh and live performances of the Andover Athletes.\n“To cover Phillips Academy Athletics for such a long time – that’s certainly a privilege. I’ve written and tweeted about some of the top athletes in Andover and New England history, and I hope that stays with me as I grow older. In terms of the Sports Section, it is left in the capable hands of Nithish Kalpat ‘18 and Jen Lee ‘18. I believe Reuben Philip ‘18 and Anjunae Chandran ‘18 are also carrying a bit of the load, but to be truthful I always saw the duo as much more of an Upper Management tandem — I was shocked when they didn’t apply,” said Johnson.\nWith Emma Wong ’18 as the Head Copy Editor, Isabelle Bicks ’18, Zoe Hutchins ’18, Nicholas Schoeller ’18, and Larson Tolo ’18, former Associate Copy Editors, will replace Peter Rossano ’17, and Jair Suazo ’17 to lead the Copy Section. Rossano expressed the strong faith he had in the team’s ability to interact with and support a diverse range of editors in the newsroom.\n“Copy Gang? They’re lively as ever! We’ve got Emma, Larson, Isabelle, Nick, and Zoe. Everyone’s great, everyone’s extremely hard workers, if not the hardest workers down there because we’re suffering through every single article there is. I have great faith in them to keep running the paper. It’s going to be hard for them initially, as it always is right after turnover, but they’ll pull through,” he said.\nFormer Associate Photo Editors Ale Macaya ’18 and Tyler Rynne ’18 will continue the teamwork Leah Hamann ’17 and James Wolfe ’17 have shown for the past year as Photo Editors. The duo will actively capture memorable events such as Head of School John Palfrey walking into Commons with his Blue Squash Racket.\n“I think Ale and Tyler will do a great job. They worked really hard as associates and I think they work really well together. They both really love what they do, and they’ve definitely handled the stresses of last-minute photo stuff well,” said Hamann.\nConnor Devlin ’18 and Charlie Mayhew ’18, former Associate Features Editor, will add humor and liveliness into the paper as they will step on as Features Editors, a position previously held by Emma Rosz Kelley ’17 and John Wu ’17.\n“Charlie and Connor… [are] the perfect fit for the job because between the two of them you get, obviously, a lot of humor, but also edginess and at the same time, sensitivity,” said Wu.\nFormer Associate Layout & Design Editors, Isabelle Beckwith ’18 and Lucy Jung ’18, replacing former Editor Niko Skrivanos ’17, will be responsible for the paper’s appealing and constructive layout. Evelyn Wu ’18 and Amy Xia ’19, former Associate Illustration Editors, will continue the colorful legacy of Sarah Al-Mayahi ’17 and Alice Lu ’17 by drawing and refining illustrations that accompany heavy texts.\nMeanwhile, under CXL, the paper will place heavier emphasis on digital-first content, especially through vitalizing the Digital and Video Section, spearheaded under the leadership of Executive Digital Editor, Cedric Elkouh ’18. Fully utilizing his background as Associate Online Producer, Elkouh will be replacing Ally Klionsky ’17 and Rudd Fawcett ’18 to continue and expand news content beyond physical paper.\n“Cedric has a ton of ideas for the paper, and I think he’s going to make a great Executive Digital Editor,” said Klionsky.\nFawcett said “I’m really excited to be working very closely with the Digital Editorial boards to further that relationship and to reconfigure how we’re thinking about digital journalism in the context of The Phillipian, and also how we’re thinking about The Phillipian as a newspaper, content-wise, and how we’re thinking of The Phillipian as a business. And so there’s some stuff in the works. I think there’ll be some pretty exciting changes to come.”\nIn support of such mission, Julia Morrissey ’18 and Jessica Wang ’18, former Associate Video Associates, will succeed Mika Curran ’17, Syler Sallick ’17, and Charlotte Suan ’17 as Video Editors.\nAt the same time, Lior Hirschfield ’17 and Jerry Yang ’17, former Online Editors, will pass down the paper’s online platform to the hands of Eliza Bienstock ’18, former Associate Online Producer, and Caroline Yun ’18, former Features Staff Writer. The Phillipian will also appoint Samantha Bloom ’18 as its first Data Visualization Editor, who will be responsible for initiating engaging graphing projects as well as designing the State of the Academy issue.\nThe Business Board, previously a four-person team under the leadership of Sabrina Lu ’17, will almost double in size with Matt Shea ’18, former Business Associate, as Chief Financial Officer.\nLu described her time in The Phillipian as a transformative moment in her life, which led her to find “a second family” that would provide “endless support. Stepping down from her position as Chief Financial Officer, Lu had the utmost confidence in her successor.\n“Matthew [is] a very kind and compassionate person, qualities that are very important as a leader, and because of this he gets along very well with the people in the newsroom,” said Lu.\nAlongside Shea, Alexandra Loumidis ’18 and Michael McCullom ’18 will inherit Advertising Managers from former Managers Kristy Lam ’17 and Wendy Zhang ’17, while Pierce Bausano ’18 and Lara Robinson ’18 will become Business Managers. In place of former Subscription Manager Connor Haugh, Moyo Oyebode ’18 will assume a new role as Circulation Manager.\n\n', 'Feb 3, 2017'), ('\nRevisiting the group of students from the Class of 2011 who created a song to illustrate Andover as a place where a diverse group of students can grow and thrive.\n\xa0\n“Some say PA is only worth diploma day, but those you know will tell you that it isn’t so. The fact is that appearances are inexact, though to the masses unbeknown, the school is more than just a stepping stone… To be or not to be…”\nThat is the question Michael Kontaxis ’11, Charlie Danner ’11, fellow students, and Andover faculty tried to answer back in 2011 through “The Andover Song,” painting a picture of Andover as a place where a diverse range of students can, and do, thrive.\nThe video incorporated performances from many students of the Class of 2011, Seniors at the time the video was created, as well as faculty members such as Kevin Graber, Senior Associate Director in Admissions, Aya Murata, Associate Director in College Counseling, and Paul Murphy ’84, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.\nNow an eight-minute Google-certified viral video according to YouTube’s newly added description, the song’s music video had garnered over 300,000 views by the time of writing since its first posting on July 28, 2011. The song has also been featured in publications including, but not limited to, “The Huffington Post,” “Slate,” “Village Voice,” “Grantland,” “Gawker,” and “Time Magazine.”\nKontaxis wrote the music and the lyrics as well as directing and editing the video, while Danner produced the instrumental component.\nKontaxis said in an interview with The Phillipian,“I’d been writing the lyrics for a while, just on and off, but the actual recording and shooting was done in basically my very last week at Andover, in terms of getting all the people, filming, and recording the song.”\nAccording to Kontaxis, he created the video in order to break certain stereotypes that may have existed about Andover and prep school students as a group, especially among college admissions teams.\n“It actually started with my college counselor, Jonathan Nicholson… looking for a video he could show to college scouts. They would hold these events on campus where scouts from [colleges] would come… and there were a lot of misconceptions about Andover… particularly in regard to thinking it was a privileged school with a bunch of rich kids. And he wanted to dispel the notion of that,” said Kontaxis in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe graduating class, however, also intended it to be somewhat of a farewell to their school. Casey McQuillen ’11, one of the performers in the video, said, “The intention behind it was to have a representation outside of ourselves of our experience at Andover, and what it had meant to us.”\n“We were in an interesting period of Andover where we were leaving, and I think that naturally lends itself to reflection, and I think music is a really great way to be able to share your feelings with others, and the words Michael wrote really exemplified what our group of friends felt as we were leaving,” she continued.\nMurphy was Dean of Students when Michael Kontaxis approached him to star in the video. Although he was nervous at first, Murphy eventually agreed to appear in the film, alongside other faculty members.\n“When students ask you to be in videos and you’re the Dean of Students, you don’t exactly know where the footage is gonna go. But at one point I thought ‘who cares, what do I have to lose’. Mrs. Chase eventually said yes and Mrs. Sykes did too so it was fun,” said Murphy.\nGraber, the most featured faculty member in the video, with a total of three verses performed to his credit, said, “I’ve soaked up so much celebrity because of ‘The Andover Song’… Almost everywhere I go from Aspen, Colorado, to New York City, to here in our own office of admission — I introduce myself to a prospective student or family, and they say, ‘Hey, you’re that guy from ‘The Andover Song’! It’s always amazing.”\nHe also discussed how “The Andover Song” represents something integral to the Andover experience: putting oneself outside one’s comfort zone. He hoped that by appearing in the video he could act as a role model to new students.\nCurrent students seem to enjoy and take a lot from the video as well.\nRomulus Sottile ’19 told The Phillipian the story of the day he was accepted to Andover. He said, “When I came home from school on March 10, my parents were playing ‘The Andover Song’ so I knew I had gotten in. The video was so fun and well-made that it made me so psyched to be going here. I wanted to be like the kids in the video who were so academically and athletically-able. Coming from a public school, the lives shown in the video were so different than the one I was used to and I was just really excited to be a part of that environment.”\n\n', 'Jan 27, 2017'), ('\nFor our exclusive online feature, please visit https://womensmarch.phillipian.net.\n\n', 'Jan 27, 2017'), ('\n“What is our generation’s mission statement?”\nFourteen Andover students sought to answer this question at Andover’s first ever TEDx Youth Conference last Saturday. Organized by Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19 with support from the Tang Institute and Stuart Paap, a third-party speech coach, the event covered a distinct set of topics that ranged from the dangers of artificial intelligence to the solution to world hunger.\n“We should have a deep look on how our generation wants to reflect the changes that we want to see in society. Our generation lacks definition. It doesn’t lack passion or determination,” said Kanchinadam in her opening remarks to the conference.\nKanchinadam hopes to make the conference an annual occurrence at Andover. The three-hour-long conference was divided into three sessions and two intermissions, where attendees were encouraged to begin a dialogue with participants and ask any questions one-on-one. The event was also recorded and streamed at the Mural Room and on the Tang Institute website.\nDuring a brief speech prior to student presentations, Head of School John Palfrey said, “What I’m so excited about is what we will see today in terms of the students’ commitment to figuring out ways to solve big problems. To make a case, to make an argument, to stand up in public and to apply the work they have been thinking about for so long.”\nA long-time fan of TED conferences, Kanchinadam first pitched the idea of hosting one at Andover when she arrived on campus last year as a Junior. Planning sessions held in The Nest allowed her to collaborate with other students and brainstorm for this year’s conference.\n“One of the hardest things that we had to do was finding a theme that [could] balance both the interest of our Andover’s community [and] the interest of the global TED community. We decided [on] the theme ‘What is our generation’s mission statement?’ [because] that question felt more like something other people had been trying to answer for us in our entire lives,” said Kanchinadam in an interview with The Phillipian. \nWhile writing about their topics, students were instructed to draw from their own personal experiences and construct their arguments around issues they cared about. During the process of applying and preparing, participants submitted short paragraphs explaining their ideas, recorded videos of themselves giving their speeches, and practiced both in the library and on stage over the course of the week. \nHosshini Suraj ’19, who was in the audience last Saturday, said, “I thought [the conference] was a really great experience. Each talk uniquely contributed to the overall theme of ‘what is our generation’s mission statement?’ I really learned a lot from Makenna’s talk on gentrification. She had a lot of examples and really broke down the issue… I would encourage anyone who wasn’t able to make it this year to try to make it to the next conference.”\nKanchinadam hopes to improve upon the conference next year by inviting students from schools around the area to participate and to admit a larger audience.\n“I believe that ideas and knowledge are worth sharing. They’re not properties of Phillips Academy or something else. I think that’s what made this project so amazing — that these ideas that often times seem trapped in the ‘Andover Bubble’ [were released],” said Kanchinadam. \n\n', 'Jan 26, 2017'), ('\nSilence, broken up by students shifting in their chairs, was all that could be heard in Kemper Auditorium after the anonymous question, “How can I help my partner discover his prostate?”, was asked at the “With the Door Open” faculty panel. The event aimed to challenge the awkwardness and secrecy typically associated with sex education talks by holding an open faculty panel.\nLast Friday, students filled Kemper to attend the event, which saw a panel of teachers covering topics related to sexual health at Andover proposed by students. The event was held by the Brace Center after a year of planning, and emceed by Dakoury Godo-Solo ’17 and Nell Fitts ’18.\nTopics covered included Andover’s disciplinary policy with respect to sexual activity, the school’s parietal rules, the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center’s facilities and resources for dealing with issues of sexual health, and general information on healthy relationships.\n“What really got the ball rolling was that there was a sort of revelation for some people that, in some dorms, sex talks weren’t being had, and so this was really a project to make sure that all students had available to them the necessary information about their sexual health and things of that nature,” said Fitts in an interview with The Phillipian.\nQuestions were submitted anonymously into an online Socratic quiz, the address of which was provided to everyone in the audience. The questions could be submitted either before or during the event. They were then read to the panel by the student emcees. Audience members also had the choice of asking questions out loud if they wished, but anonymity remained an option.\nParticipants found that anonymity was a very important facet of the panel, serving to create a more comfortable space in which students could ask questions they may otherwise be embarrassed to introduce.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Godo-Solo said, “There’s a lot of stigma surrounding sex, in terms of having it, but also not having it. So, since it was a very sex-positive space, for someone who’s chosen not to engage in sexual activity for whatever reasons, it’s nice to be able to have everyone hold back and not feel like since you aren’t asking questions you aren’t engaging.”\nThe adults on the panel were chosen for their positions on campus, which placed each of them in a unique place to talk about different aspects of sexuality and relationships at Andover.\nDavid Farnsworth, Psychological Counselor and Wellness Educator at the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center said in an interview with The Phillipian, “To have a bunch of teenagers who are dealing with their hormones, or are curious, or wondering, it’s so easy for them to find depictions, maybe on the internet, of a lot of the stuff they’re wondering about.”\n“I think what’s out there could be confusing, it could be misrepresented, images of beauty are twisted to be filmed, so I think that having real people in their lives just to join with them and answer those questions and give them more resources, or clarify what they’re seeing out there, I think that’s important,” continued Farnsworth.\nSome students in attendance had not had any sort of formal sexual health education at their old schools or in their homes. Will Lam ’19 said he was surprised by the openness of the faculty during the discussion, a far cry from his previous abstinence-only education.\n“Before this talk, I had barely any sex-ed experience since I went to a Catholic school. The school promoted abstinence and never talked about contraceptives or anything like that. When I went to this talk, I was surprised at how open the faculty were, but I think it’s good we can have an honest dialogue with adults on campus,” said Lam.\nJack Hjerpe ’17 said he was grateful that the discussion went beyond the typical biological explanations of sex that most schools offer.\n“I had health class that definitely touched on sex, but it focused a lot more on abstinence. The panel was great because it answered so many questions that schools normally wouldn’t take the time to answer, going deeper than just the standard biological understanding that schools normally offer,” said Hjerpe.\nThe panelists and student emcees made it clear that “With the Door Open” was not intended to be a one-time event and told the audience that they hope to put on more panels like it in the near future.\n\n', 'Jan 23, 2017'), ('\nExploring the question, “What is our generation’s mission statement?” 13 students will make presentations in the upcoming TEDx Phillips Academy Youth Conference this Saturday. The conference is organized and hosted by Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19 with the help of the Tang Institute and a student-run planning committee. Featuring scheduled student speeches with breaks for discussion in between speeches, the independently organized event is modeled after traditional TED conferences.\n“We’ve been mainly working with the Tang Institute, and also the faculty at the library, like Mr. Barker. Other than that, it’s mainly student-organized. We have a planning committee, and all the speeches are student-driven. So other than the Tang Institute we’re pretty much completely student-run,” said Kanchinadam.\nSarah Bakanosky, Tang Institute Project Coordinator, said, “The Tang Institute is doing whatever we can to help Tanvi and the student planning committee get the event up and running. It’s really nice to see the event take the form of a student-run, student-organized event and I’m just here for support. I’m helping with the more logistical aspects. Really anything we can help them out with to make sure it’s a success.”\nThe event will be focused around the central theme and will cover wide variety of topics, including the Black Lives Matter movement, gentrification, and climate change, according to Kanchinadam.\nKanchinadam said this conference was just the beginning of a longer discussion about education at Andover.\n“At the end of the conference, we don’t want you to think about it as an ending. We want you to think about it as the beginning of a new way we can approach learning at Andover,” said Kanchinadam.\n“We would love it if these conversations kept going beyond. There are great conversation starters on the 14th. We definitely want that to keep going and be lasting conversations that the students are able to contribute to and think about long after the event is over,” said Bakanosky.\nThe conference will take place on Saturday, January 14 at 4:30 p.m. in Tang Theater and will also be livestreamed to the Mural Room.\n“We encourage students to watch the conference there, or organize their own ‘viewing parties.’ We’d love everyone to use the hashtag #TEDxPAAndover to share thoughts, insights, and ideas about the event,” said Bakanosky\nMeet the TEDx Student Speakers\nThe following features were written by Christina Cho, Gwen Robinson, Newaz\xa0Rahman, Riffany\xa0Chang, Andie Pinga, Alexandra LeBaron, Will Ennis, and Patricia Thompson\nHost: Tanvi Kanchinadam\nTanvi Kanchinadam ’19 first dreamt up the idea of having a TEDx conference at Phillips Academy about a year ago, as a Junior, after being inspired by the organization’s motto, “Ideas worth spreading.” Kanchinadam hopes that student speakers who address the theme “What is our generation’s mission statement?” will provoke further discussions about critical issues in our modern world and how we can work to fix them. Kanchinadam said, “I hope that people continue [these] conversations and allow [these ideas] to grow. I think that the conversations should never just stop at this conference and I hope that this conference is just a starting point for people to really think about what they want their generation to be as opposed to every other generation that’s inhabited this planet… How can we be different? How can we make a positive impact and learn from other people’s mistakes?”\nMakenna Marshall\nLiving in Washington, D.C., gentrification of historic neighborhoods has always been a relevant issue to Makenna Marshall ’18 and her family. Marshall will speak on the issue of gentrification and the difficulties that privilege poses on finding a solution. While writing her speech, Marshall realized that the problem of gentrification may not be as complex as people make it out to be. “I realized… the reason why the problem hadn’t been solved yet wasn’t because the problem itself was tricky, but it was more because people were being difficult,” said Marshall in an interview with The Phillipian. “Reflecting on her own bias about gentrification, Marshall wrote her speech in the hope that Andover students will be able to relate with her struggle on looking at issues from a biased perspective. “The only way you can learn is by putting aside the guilt that comes with having privilege and… being open to making changes,” said Marshall.\nGracie Limoncelli\nGracie Limoncelli ’18 will discuss the power of storytelling in nursing homes and share the stories she gathered from different residents in an elderly care facility. “A major part of my TED talk was recording people’s stories… [and] one of the hardest parts of writing this entire talk was just trying to figure out what story to use because there were so many wonderful, wonderful stories. Every resident had something incredible to share. You don’t necessarily know anything about their lives from looking at them,” said Limoncelli in an interview with The Phillipian. Through presenting different stories of the elderly, the talk will specifically emphasize the importance of acknowledging and consulting with the past during the process of defining and finding this generation’s mission statement.\nClaudia Meng\nIn her TEDx talk, Claudia Meng ’18 hopes to look deeper into the ways our generation values innovation and will discuss how society’s obsession with “newness” affects our daily lives. Meng believes that the most successful entrepreneurs are the ones who work hard to be innovative in all that they do. “I’ve really been fed the idea that creation is the only method of arriving at something worthwhile, and because of that, I’ve really wanted to delve into the idea of how much value we place on creation just for the sake of creation,” said Meng in an interview with The Phillipian. She will also discuss how our generation’s obsession with gadgets may influence the future. “It’s really about how we, as a group of people, should be interacting with the future, and what our goals should be,” said Meng.\nAmiri Tulloch\nRecognizing social media’s importance in a generation increasingly defined by its internet use, Amiri Tulloch ’18 was inspired to give a talk at Andover’s TEDx event on social media activism and the black community. “This generation is creating and thriving in so many ways. Social media shouldn’t be cast off as something where little kids go and communicate, but actually a real cause of change and a tangible force,” Tulloch said in an interview with The Phillipian. A user himself, Tulloch will explore Twitter specifically as a platform for black activism. Tulloch appreciates the opportunity to share his views with the Andover community. “TEDx is something that everybody has heard of in the educational world, and it’s so fascinating to actually be involved in it and I hope that the Andover community can not only embrace it this year, but for future years too,” said Tulloch.\nAndie Pinga\nInspired by both her father’s work and a conference she attended earlier this school year, Andie Pinga ’19 will discuss world hunger and its root causes during her TEDx presentation this weekend. “Hunger is related to many factors and interconnected to many drivers of poverty, [like] malnutrition… When you’re malnourished you’re not able to earn as much income… there is this cycle of poverty that people are stuck in because they don’t have adequate food and adequate nutrition,” said Pinga in an interview with The Phillipian. Pinga believes that solving hunger will allow other problems such as poverty to be addressed. Doing so will allow for people in agricultural communities to perform at a higher level. “When you focus on nutrition, and when you give nutritious food to these children, you are investing in the future of our world because they will grow up, and they will grow up to be the managers of our world,” said Pinga.\nSarah Stack\nConcerned with the common inclination to categorize people and things, Sarah Stack ’19 will present the drawbacks of thinking in binary terms in her TEDx talk. “A lot of people are told or think about things as either a right or wrong. Good or bad, yes or no. Some people are labeled as things like you’re either good at math or bad at math. Or a Republican or Democrat. Or a girl or boy, and there is no in between,” said Stack in an interview with The Phillipian. Stack said that she hopes to help the Andover community move beyond binaries. “I thought that TEDx would be a good platform for sharing my ideas. I wanted more people to think… [about] this idea of binaries and moving beyond binaries. Thinking, instead of [giving] one answer or another answer, would be beneficial for the Andover community,” said Stack.\nLeeza Petrov\nIn her TEDx talk, Leeza Petrov ’18 will focus on deconstructing overachievement culture. Petrov suggests that our generation must learn to view ambition, competition, and achievement in a healthier and more positive way. Petrov said, “Sooner or later we’re going to enter college, and were going to enter the workforce, and we’re going to enter the real world, and we’re going to have to be equipped with the tools that we need, not just to succeed and get all these meaningless achievements,” said Petrov. “But if you come into the real world with the mindset that I need to do this, to get this… and don’t really take time to look back and reflect on your accomplishments, you’re not going to lead a very fulfilled life… it just comes down to the fact that we need to equip ourselves with the proper tools to enter the real world and be successful and happy,” continued Petrov.\nVish Dhar\nDuring a visit to India in middle school, Vish Dhar ’19 almost got into a car accident due to the brown smokescreen created by fog and pollution. This near-miss marked his first personal encounter with dangerous climate change. Three years later, Dhar is taking the TEDx stage to give his talk on climate change and the current generation. “It turns out that global climate change is probably going to be the greatest issue of our time and for our generation… If it’s not our mission as young people to solve that problem, I don’t know what other issue is,” said Dhar in an interview with The Phillipian. Dhar hopes that his talk will encourage students to utilize the power of social media and the internet to speak up about climate change. “You should go out into your community and educate people who don’t understand that this is a serious issue,” said Dhar.\nNick Toldalagi\nA passion sparked in Nick Toldalagi ’18 when he read Klaus Schwab’s “Fourth Industrial Revolution” that his dad placed on his desk a few months ago. “When people say ‘economic,’ it always sounds boring, but these things can be really interesting and not that difficult to understand for kids our age. And it’s really easy for us to use the internet to learn about them… and form your own opinions and solutions on them,” said Toldalagi in an interview with The Phillipian. On the edge of our next technological revolution, Toldalagi believes that people should recognize economic challenges that follow this major shift. He describes how Andover students especially are uniquely equipped to think big and solve these problems. “In previous times when we had these big areas of transition… some countries have suffered… we should be able to recognize these challenges ahead and be proactive about it,” said Toldalagi.\nKevin Sun\nKevin Sun ’18 will be discussing the importance of finding opportunities in one’s life and sharing them with others. As the younger brother in his family, he often felt like he was living in his brother’s shadow, and it took him some time to find enough confidence to take risks. His speech focuses on him stepping out of his comfort zone while creating and running a hackathon for Andover students last fall. Beyond simply organizing the hackathon, his TEDx talk will follow his own journey of growth and the way in which stepping out of his comfort zone has changed him as a person. He also thinks that by pushing their own boundaries, students should help others do the same. “Running this large-scale Hackathon, I just wanted to personally take some time to reflect on why I started in the first place. I think our generation needs to discover new things and step out of our boundaries, but also be able to share them with others,” said Sun.\nTessa Conrardy\nAs a Junior, Tessa Conrardy ’20 is a long way away from the college application process, but that doesn’t mean she hasn’t already witnessed how applications affect the choices Andover students make. In her TEDx presentation, she will share some of the observations she has made about the way other kids select their extracurriculars both while applying to Andover and after arriving here. She thinks kids should be more concerned with what they want to do than what they think they’ll have to do to appear impressive. “We are literally a college preparatory school, so I think especially here sometimes it’s good to just slow down and say, ‘hey, maybe I will do this purely for the purpose of enjoying it and not have to think about how I could put [it] on a bullet list of the things that I’ve done in my life,’ ”said Conrardy.\nOlivia Lai\nOlivia Lai ’20 doesn’t want Asian-Americans to be negatively affected by external stereotypes. In her TEDx Talk, she will discuss the destructive pressures of model-minority stereotypes and their effects on Asian-Americans. “Because Asian-Americans are always seen as good at math, all playing musical instruments, there’s this certain pressure to live up to a standard, and when you don’t [live up to the standard] there’s definitely a negative effect on your emotional well-being… that’s an incredible amount of stress to live under,” she said. Lai plans to continue advocating for solutions to a growing mental-health problem among Asian-Americans who she says need more support. She hopes that her TEDx Talk will help to raise awareness of a topic she thinks needs to be discussed more. “I want people to recognize that this pressure exists because no one really recognizes it and I feel like the problems of Asian-Americans aren’t seen as as important as the problems of any other racial group,” said Lai.\nGherardo Morona\xa0\nAs president of the Robotics Club on campus, Gherardo Morona ’17 has worked with robots to increase their “brain” power, all the while keeping an eye on the constant development in the field of artificial intelligence. To Morona, the major theme of this generation will be technology, specifically artificial intelligence. In his TEDx Talk, Morona hopes to bring a more dimensional approach to the topic of artificial intelligence: challenging the often negative portrayal of artificial intelligence in popular culture and shedding light on the companies and individuals who are heavily invested in it. “It’s a very controversial topic. People are oftentimes scared and worried from seeing science fiction movies and popular media,” said Morona. “In science fiction movies, you’ve seen, probably, the program with the machine going against humanity — this story about [a robot takeover] is told very often… I want to talk about how as Andover students [we can] tackle [the issue].”\n\n', 'Jan 20, 2017'), ('\nGina Soutendijk ’15, described by her friends and close faculty members as compassionate, caring, and wise beyond her years, passed away peacefully of a heart attack in her sleep on January 5, according to her father, Greg Soutendijk. Soutendijk, a sophomore at McGill University, came to Andover as a new Lower. She was 20 years old.\n“Gina was loved and valued immensely by the Andover community. She was an impeccable writer, a good friend, and a beautiful person inside and out. She was one of those people that everyone knew of and respected, even if it was just for her smirk,” said Charlotte Berry ’15, Soutendijk’s close friend and roommate for two years.\nAnother characteristic that made Soutendijk special was how she brought a spark of fun to every situation, making each moment special, says her close friend Kaylee Llewellyn ’15.\n“Gina had an incredible ability to make even the most mundane moments memorable and extraordinary. Looking back on the time that we spent together at Andover I am filled with numerous memories of us dancing and belting out Taylor Swift as we walked towards our caramel macchiatos downtown, watching crappy horror movies, and sitting in Paul Revere talking about any and everything,” said Llewellyn.\nMorgan Rooney ’17 remembers Soutendijk as an upperclassman mentor and was thrilled when their friendship began to blossom.\nCourtesy of Kaylee LlewellynSoutendijk, right, “was the first person to show me what loyalty, love, and compassion looked like in a best friend,” said Llewellyn, left.\n“Gina meant a lot to me. As an upperclassman, I looked up to her, so when she and I began casually chatting over Facebook and Twitter, I was so happy,” said Rooney. “Gina radiated so much love and humor and I’ll always cherish the kind words she has written to me over the years. I’ll miss playing Club Penguin with her in Silent Study, and I’ll miss her irreplaceable spirit.”\nSoutendijk was a constant presence in Paul Revere Hall, where she lived her Upper and Senior years. She often babysat for her primary house counselor in the dorm, Andrea Orben. Orben recalls Soutendijk’s kindness toward Orben’s daughter, Helene. Orben says that Soutendijk often welcomed Helene to her dorm room.\n“Gina was close with my family and was a favorite babysitter for our three young children. My eldest, Helene, loved to wander upstairs in the dorm to Gina and Charlotte’s room to read gossip magazines and to have her nails painted using their extensive polish collection,” said Orben.\nSoutendijk was always open and willing to have deep conversations, even with the younger girls in her hall, according to Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English and one of Soutendijk’s house counselors in Paul Revere Hall. \n“When I talked to girls who are now Seniors, who knew her when they were Lowers, they all say that she was always kind and inclusive towards them,” said Staffaroni. “I have the sense from a couple of girls I’ve talked to that Gina was always willing to chat about something that happened and have a one-on-one, heart-to-heart with them.”\nDuring Soutendijk’s Upper year, Berry borrowed a hedgehog from a friend for a long weekend, smuggling the pet into their dorm room. After being caught, Staffaroni and Soutendijk bonded over the incident.\n“I’ll just never forget Gina’s faux-shame about it. She clearly just thought it was hilarious, like she had no shame whatsoever about the fact that this had happened, but we were like, ‘You cannot have a hedgehog in the dorm.’ And she just thought it was hilarious,” said Staffaroni. “It became a really funny inside joke with them, particularly with Gina, for the rest of her time in the dorm.”\nFriends cite Soutendijk’s sense of humor, knowing smile, and knack for planning ridiculous jokes as some of her defining characteristics.\n“I guess my warmest memories of her are just of laughing with her. She was a really darkly funny person… She just had this really funny, sarcastic way about her. She could do these one-liners that were just really funny…she always had the ability to look at you and smirk knowingly, like with a sense of wisdom above the world,” said Staffaroni.\nSamir Safwan ’16 said, “A funny memory we have is that halfway through our music class during Extended Period Week, we went to the bathroom and switched clothes. Still not sure if the teacher ever noticed. She was an amazing friend and I’m so happy I had the chance of spending so much time with her at Andover.”\n“She also was extremely compassionate as a friend to her peers… She had relationships while I was her house counselor, and she seemed to be really good at loving people. That’s what I remember and hold dear, the laughter and the big heart,” said Staffaroni.\nLlewellyn describes Soutendijk’s impact on her life and says she will always love her friend dearly.\n“I will never forget that she always wore her socks inside out because she hated the way the seam felt on her toes. I will never forget her smile, her laugh, and the way she passionately lived her life to the fullest no matter what obstacles got in her way. Gina was the first person to show me what loyalty, love, and compassion looked like in a best friend. I will forever remember her as my best friend, and love her as my sister,” said Llewellyn.\nAs her roommate for two years, Berry hopes Soutendijk’s memory will encourage students to be kind and sensitive to everyone.\n“I hope Gina’s legacy will remind those at Andover that even if those around them appear to have it all — beauty, popularity, intelligence — it does not mean they are not in need of support and care. You never know what your peers are going through, so be kind, be kind, be kind,” said Berry.\nAccording to an email Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, wrote to the student body, a service was held in Soutendijk’s memory at McGill University on Thursday, January 12, and another service was planned to be held in Singapore this week. A moment of silence was observed at All School Meeting this Monday in honor of Soutendijk.\n\n', 'Jan 20, 2017'), ('\nThe Academy Chorus and Gospel Choir joined together to sing the hearty refrain of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” during the opening celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day at All-School Meeting (ASM) last Monday. \nThe keynote speaker this year was Melissa Harris-Perry, a professor at Wake Forest University, political commentator, activist, and award-winning author. In addition to hosting her own award-winning show on MSNBC, Harris-Perry is currently an editor-at-large at ELLE.com.\nLaShawn Springer, Director of Community and Multicultural Development and an organizer of the day’s speakers and events, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “[Harris-Perry] has been on our shortlist for quite some time because of her work on the intersection of race and gender. In the midst of a highly contentious presidential campaign, now really seemed like the right time to get her to campus… As a political and social commentator, writer and professor, she’s in the business of keeping us honest.”\nAfter remarks from Springer and Linda Griffith, Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion, Auguste White ’17 and Isabel Jauregui ’17 relayed their personal experiences with Harris-Perry’s work before welcoming her to the stage. \n“I’ve only seen [Harris-Perry] behind my television screen. She has been an active [presence] since I was 12-years old. She narrated critical, political and social moments and movements for me, [including] the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the natural hair movement, and transgender issues… She’s had a profound impact on me and my family, as a lot of her stories are about black women told in a black woman’s voice,” said White at ASM.\nT.Rynne/The Phillipian\nHarris-Perry focused her keynote presentation on the power of storytelling and understanding narratives from the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the need for black women leaders today.\nCiting King’s usage of the press and television to successfully publicize nationwide movements, she said that social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter can be used to raise awareness and incite action for African-American activists today.\nShe also stressed the importance of choosing which stories to tell and conveying all aspects of those narratives. For instance, Harris-Perry objected to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C., because it fails to acknowledge King’s community.\n“Now that [memorial is] just wrong, it reinforces the great big man… who came from nothingness. No, King came out of a community. He came out of a movement, a church, a family, and a bunch of other people doing work. It’s exactly that kind of revision that, for me, is so distressing. In addition to making King still and immobile and disconnected… now, we tell [a different] story of King. It’s a story of [how King], who is a great disruptor of the American story, [is] now part of the perfecting of the American narrative,” said Harris-Perry.\nHarris-Perry also discussed the need for the emergence of black girl leaders. She said that there was a need to dismiss patriarchy and encourage “blackness” to be an obstruction of inequality. According to Harris-Perry, asking about the missing stories of black women in history helps foster a more complete picture of the Civil Rights movement and American history.\nT.Rynne/The Phillipian\n“[It’s] important to get different stories… out there because the black woman voice is so often unheard,” said Amadi Lasenberry ’17. “[Harris-Perry’s] point of view [and speech] wasn’t only geared towards a group of black women on campus, it was for the whole school, which is cool.”\nJack Curtin ’19 said that he gained a new perspective on King and his contributions to the Civil Rights Movement through Harris-Perry’s presentation.\n“MLK fought for equality, but [Harris-Perry] talked a lot about how he wasn’t widely accepted in his time, but we have to fight these assumptions about him and fit it in our daily lives right now,” said Curtin.\nDuring his closing remarks, Head of School John Palfrey acknowledged the significance of Harris-Perry’s message in the classroom and encouraged students to challenge and advocate for a more inclusive community.\n“As a teacher of U.S. history, [Harris-Perry has] given us a counter narrative to one that is taught in so many schools across this country and, I think, our own school… You have given us a lot to think about and reflect on exactly what we are doing in this project of education,” said Palfrey. “[MLK Day] is a day of work… and activism.”\n\n', 'Jan 20, 2017'), ('\nWhen Mae Zhao ’18 first came to Andover, she was not truly aware of the effects of her diagnosed ADD. In an interview with The Phillipian, Zhao said she began to pile up extracurriculars and other commitments, which strained her ability to focus on her work, and consequently affected her mental health.\n“In middle school and elementary school, I didn’t really work on study habits because it was middle school, so I could just push through. There also was not a lot of extracurriculars, so it was just homework and done. Once I came to Andover, I definitely overcommitted myself because I still had that belief that — even though I had ADD — whatever other people do, I can do it, too,” said Zhao.\nAfter learning to prioritize and adjust her workload to fit her needs in her Upper year, Zhao created DyAD — a combination of the learning disabilities Dyslexia, ADD, and ADHD — a new club aimed to encourage students to learn how they can embrace their disabilities, with John Rauen ’17, Katie Hartzell ’18, Oliver Pennington ’18, and John Sandor ’18. According to the Academic Skills Center, over 80 students currently deal with learning disabilities that hinder their ability to focus or work at the same rate as their peers.\nZhao said, “These experiences that I had dealing with ADD… I could use that to help other lowerclassmen. I really wish that as a lowerclassmen, somebody came up to me and told me, ‘It is okay if you do less than somebody else.’ ”\nThe club aspires to help students with learning disabilities learn to reach out for any help they might need at Andover and advise them on specific studying skills they may need to work with their disabilities.\nDyAD will also serve as a forum for students to congregate and discuss their experiences with learning disabilities at Andover.\n“I was struggling a lot in French,” said Rauen. “It was either Thanksgiving Break or Winter Break that I got tested and ended up being dyslexic… I don’t really think of it as a disability, it is just a difference.”\nSome members of the club indicate that there are not enough resources on campus to help people living with learning disabilities.\nHartzell had trouble keeping up with her work during her first term at Andover, before she was diagnosed with ADD during her second term. She acknowledges that although Andover provided tools to help her academically, she didn’t know where to turn to for emotional support, which DyAD aims to provide.\n“I wasn’t diagnosed with ADD until Winter Term of my freshman year, and to be honest, Fall Term was hard,” wrote Hartzell in an email to The Phillipian. “Once I learned the reason why I had trouble finishing tests and my work quickly, it all made sense, but it didn’t make it any easier. I had to come up with studying methods to help cope with it by myself, and even though Andover does a great job providing disability services, there was never much emotional support.”\nDyAD hosted its first-ever meeting this past Sunday in Paresky Commons, and members used the time to share personal experiences. Although the club’s board is still comprised entirely of upperclassmen, board members hope to bring younger students into the fold and serve as mentors.\n“Just to have an idea of other students that are going through the exact same thing helps you build a little bit of confidence,” said Sandor. “It also helps that you can share methods because by Senior or Upper year, you have got to figure it out. I think it is a good idea to have an organization on campus that can pass this down.”\nHartzell said, “The rest of the board and I hope that people with learning disabilities, especially underclassmen, will come to our meetings so they don’t feel as alone in the difficulties they face. Through sharing stories, advice, and just discussing a topic that, for some reason, seems to be quite stigmatized on campus, we can help each other and ourselves.”\nZhao hopes students struggling with a potential learning disability will reach out sooner rather than later if they need help.\n“It is okay to have a learning disability and be different than your classmates. You are not stupid if you learn differently and it takes you a little longer,” said Zhao.\nEditor’s Note: Katie Hartzell is an Associate Commentary Editor for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Jan 20, 2017'), ('\nThe 4×5 schedule has officially been rejected, after years of planning and just months away from implementation. Results from the December 2016 revote, which was held the week of Monday, December 12, certified the faculty’s decision to reject the 4×5 schedule, extending the current schedule into the 2017-2018 academic year.\nThe official revote was an immediate response to the results of a previous advisory vote, which portrayed a distinct change in faculty sentiment since the initial schedule vote was held in January 2016. While 56 percent (119 votes) of the faculty participants voted in support of the 4×5 schedule in the original vote last January, only 35 percent (72 votes) of participants approved the 4×5 in the recent December revote.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Head of School John Palfrey said, “Faculty voted in favor of the 4×5 last winter, and it came out a different way this past term. I think that it had to do with looking at the particulars of what it would entail, and I think a number of people decided to change their point of view, that the benefits were outweighed by some of the costs that are associated with it.”\n“In my view, that was the right time to take a formal revote, step back, and take a break, which we’ll do this winter, and go back at it in the spring. I remain optimistic that we can improve upon our schedule and calendar,” he continued.\nIn the meantime, Palfrey noted how the school will continue with its current schedule and calendar for the 2017-18 academic year.\n“This shift in timing means we will apply what we have learned over these past few months, continue to engage students in this process, and expand our research more broadly, with a goal of a new schedule and calendar beginning in the fall of either 2018 or 2019,” he wrote in an email sent to students, families, faculty, and staff.\nWith the 4×5 model, the schedule would have consisted of four terms with five periods each, potentially less homework time, a school starting time of 8:30 a.m., greater time for collaborative work between faculty and students, and improvement of the Empathy and Balance curriculum.\nAccording to Palfrey’s email to the Andover community, “The design of a new student-centered schedule and calendar is one of several ways [the community] honor[s] commitments to academic excellence as well as empathy and balance, equity and inclusion, and creativity and innovation at Andover.”\nChristopher Jones, Instructor and Chair in History and Social Sciences, explained how the 4×5 was designed to provide a healthier lifestyle both in and out of the classroom.\n“My view of the current schedule is that it facilitates the desire of many students to do as much as possible, but fosters superficial engagement, lack of sleep, anxiety, unhealthy living habits, and, worst of all, a cheap intellectual life,” said Jones in an interview with The Phillipian. “It was designed to address major concerns the faculty have about student health, wellbeing, and intellectual life.”\n“The 4×5 addressed major initiatives of [Andover’s] Strategic Plan by building more time into student and faculty days and weeks to advance a richer intellectual environment, a healthier social and living environment, and more time for faculty collaboration and interdisciplinary coursework,” he continued.\nMany faculty members, however, expressed the need for modifications to the current schedule, but opposed some of the specific changes that the 4×5 schedule would have brought next fall.\nSome students also did not completely support the 4×5 schedule, citing lengthened classes, and sporadic course curriculums as reasons for hesitance.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Aidan Driscoll ’17 said, “I did not completely support the 4×5 schedule, my reasons being [because] I did not think it would be beneficial for those taking languages to take them sporadically throughout the year. I also thought that it would be hard to keep paying attention in long classes and with longer homework assignments and would force students to be learning multiple concepts at once in classes like math and science.”\nAndrew Wang’ 18 said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I am glad that [the 4×5 schedule] is gone. It gives me a chance to complete my schedule and take more classes next year…and take five courses [a term].”\nLilia Cai-Hurteau, Instructor in Chinese, suggested how each department should have their own “pedagogical priorities” that allow for individualized approaches in learning.\n“What I would like to see is for the faculty to develop a schedule that is intentionally differentiated to suit the diverse needs of different departments and different students,” wrote Cai-Hurteau in an email to The Phillipian.\n“Our teachers have been very innovative when developing a variety of class schedules under the current system by mixing up red-dots, singles, doubles and super doubles. I believe that our faculty will continue to work hard to come up with an improved schedule that honors the principles of continuity, flexibility as well as student and faculty wellness,” she continued.\n\n', 'Jan 13, 2017'), ('\nSheena Hilton, Instructor in Chemistry and House Counselor in Paul Revere Hall, will replace Matthew Hession, Instructor in History and Social Sciences, as Dean of Flagstaff Cluster next year, having been selected after a series of interviews. Hession has been serving in the role since the fall of 2011, and his six-year term will be ending this June in accordance with school policy.\nDuring his time as Dean, Hession has tried to foster a closer cluster community by reaching out to and looking after all members of Flagstaff.\n“In all honesty, Mr. Hession is one of the people who makes Flagstaff Cluster what it is, a cluster of friendship and empathy. Every single time you go to a munch you have students walk up to him and he knows their names and he says something nice about them. He tries to make their day and cheer them up. He is one of the most understanding adults on campus,” said Abdelaziz Bahnasy ’17.\nHilton, who has been a house counselor in Paul Revere Hall for four years took a leave of absence for the past two years to receive her Master’s Degree from Cornell. Over that time, she has loved her experiences in her dorm. Though she will miss living in Paul Revere, she looks forward to getting to know all members of the Flagstaff community.\n“Paul Revere has been my home the whole four years I’ve been in the cluster. I’m very partial to my dorm. I like that it’s big so I get to know a lot of different girls but I also feel that we have a strong community feel within the dorm,” said Hilton.\n“I’ll be really sad to leave Paul Revere, but there are more than 200 people in Flagstaff, so it will be nice to be part of a larger group of children’s lives,” she continued.\nBecause of her time in Paul Revere, Hilton is already familiar with the Flagstaff Cluster. To her, the central location of Flagstaff means that she tends to be in the center of student life on campus.\nFor Hession, the end of the year will be bittersweet. Without the duties of Cluster Dean, Hession hopes to spend more time and energy with his family come next year. Being the Dean of Flagstaff, however, has shaped not only his own time at Andover but also his family’s, and the past six years will always hold a special place in his memories. At the end of the year, Hession and his family will move out of Newton-Hinman House, where he and his family have lived since his appointment.\n“I know I’m going to miss all of the students that I get to be interacting with and sharing time with and there is going to be a longing there,” said Hession. “My son Will has gone from entering this world to turning six years old this summer, so [Andover] has certainly been our home and we’ve made it our home.”\nHession is optimistic about Flagstaff’s future and trusts that Hilton will effectively carry out all of the responsibilities that the job entails.\n“I think Ms. Hilton is absolutely tireless in the support she has for kids. I think she is an educator here in school who takes a really strong interest in kids, in thinking about kids, in thinking about their experience here,” said Hession.\n“When it comes to thinking about community, whether it be the dorm community that she has been a part of in Paul Revere, whether it’s the cluster community in Flagstaff, or her classroom community, she’s a person who is always thinking about how it is the kids are interacting with each other and the importance of making sure that all of those interactions are positive and that kids are finding meaning in what it is they’re doing,” continued Hession.\nDue to the heavy time commitments of the position, Hilton will be dropping one of her Chemistry classes at the start of next year. Hilton hopes to continue fostering a positive cluster culture when she becomes Dean in the fall.\n“I think I’d like to maintain and increase the community aspect among Flagstaff. I think a lot of students move here because of the location and it would be nice to maintain the cluster pride that’s already out there and to beef it up a little bit too, hopefully through more cluster munches and smaller munches with just maybe one or two dorms at a time so I can get to know people a lot easier.

In an attempt to address the demands of the changing school, a group of Andover staff members from the Shuman Office of Admissions, the Office of Information and Technology, and Summer Session and Outreach, are leading an effort to streamline navigation on the site and provide a means for prospective students and their families to learn more about various programs and events at Andover.\nThe Andover website, which is currently the school’s primary digital outlet for sharing campus news and links to important application or registration forms, has remained mostly unchanged since it was designed.\n“After a successful redesign of Andover’s admission catalog and viewbook [that were] published this fall, it makes strategic sense that our main digital publication, the public website, would follow,” wrote Tracy Sweet, Director of Academy Communications, in an email to The Phillipian.\n“Since [the last time the website was updated], we have refreshed some of our upper-level pages and built a handful of custom sites to support priorities, such as the Strategic Plan, the Tang Institute, the Sykes Wellness Center, and athletics,” said Sweet.\nAndover has partnered with New York-based Brooklyn United, a digital agency that specializes in website design and user experience, to assist with the redesign process. \n“We’ve been working with Brooklyn United to… get an idea for what we want out of our new website, what each different department needs and what the different prevailing attitudes are about what our website does and does not accomplish right now,” said Beth Friedman, Director of Outreach and Summer Session.\nFriedman said that students and teachers will also be able to provide input and test out parts of the new website as they are created. Specifically, removing the drop-down menus that appear when users hover over titles on the website, and focusing more on the search bar tool instead.\n“When we get into the actual specifics of development, there will be lots more opportunities for everyone on campus to weigh in… There’s also going to be user testing where we recruit people to test out the website and we do things like track their eyes and see where they click and all of those things that can identify to us what a more appropriate setup will be,” she said.\n“I think some of the things people are going to be excited about is one, we want to make some of our content less redundant and more relevant. We want to be able to highlight news and information for students, we want calendars to be more readily accessible showing what all is going all across campus. And we want that to be more user friendly, more design friendly, and look less like it was built in 1997 and more like it was built in 2016,” continued Friedman.\nSome students have already expressed their displeasure with aspects of the current website that they hope will be addressed in the redesign.\n“I dislike how old a lot of the photos [look] once you get off of the home page because it just makes the website seem stagnant,” said Paige Morss ’17.\n“I know when I was applying to Andover, I went on that section and saw all the different clubs but that’s [no longer] updated. They also need to work on explanation [of extracurriculars] for students applying to Andover so they know what’s going on,” said Allison Zhu ’19.\nThe redesign will also focus specifically on the appearance of the site from the perspective of families interested in Andover.\n“Some families may not have the opportunity to visit campus before their child applies. The website serves as a welcoming gateway – a digital front door – for students considering whether Andover may be a good educational fit,” said Sweet.\nThe website redesigning will begin later this winter and continue through the spring. Leaders of the project are hopeful the redesign will be complete when the 2017-2018 academic year commences in September.\n“I don’t want to overpromise. I think none of us want to overpromise, but we would like this website to launch for next fall.

In order for them to get it all done they could really use our help.”\nThe team specifically shovels areas which O.P.P. cannot clear with snow plows.\n“The only way to remove snow from stairs is to manually shovel – this is where we have helped and will help again tomorrow,” Hurley continued.\nGirls Crew Co-Captain Evelyn Mesler ’17 said, “For the crew team, it’s been tradition for every year that I’ve been on the team… It’s a good workout, and [the workout] definitely promotes team morale. It’s just a way of helping out and giving back.”\nAccording to Boys Crew Captain Luke Bitler ’17, around 10-12 members of the team began shoveling the Chapel steps as soon as boarders were allowed to leave their dorms in the morning. Following the Chapel, the team made their way around campus, shoveling the steps of the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Vista, George Washington Hall, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, Samuel Phillips Hall, Paresky Commons, Susie’s, and finishing at the Borden Gym after an hour.\n“Shoveling has been a long-standing tradition that the crew team does every year. The reason we do it is to show our gratitude to the school and O.P.P. and the hard work they do for us everyday. I think the team understands that and is held as an important value that we share,” said Bitler.\nRemus Sottile ’19 described how shoveling in the winter promotes team bonding, especially helping new members acquaint themselves with upperclassmen on the team. \n“I volunteered because I felt that it would give me a chance to bond with some of my teammates which is something I always prioritize. How close I am with my teammates has a lot to do with how well we’ll row together in the spring which then determines whether we’ll win races or not,” said Sottile in an email to The Phillipian.\xa0\nGirls Crew Co-Captain Elizabeth Irvin ’17 wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I’ve been shoveling snow with the crew team since my [Junior] year… it was a great way to get to know upperclassman on the team.”\n“I think it’s just nice to wake up early, hang out with my teammates for a bit and spent sometime outside, and then go through the rest of my day knowing that I did something nice for the campus,” Irvin continued.\nIrvin says the tradition of team shoveling helps build team spirit and cohesiveness, especially outside of winter training and in preparation for the competitive interscholastic spring season. It also provides an additional workout for rowers and coxswains who participate in winter crew training. \n“It’s the kind of thing that works really well for a crew team, because our sport is all about putting ourselves one the line and making ourselves uncomfortable for the benefit of the boat and the team.

I cannot speak on any particular suspects, but we have some leads we are looking into,” wrote Lieutenant Edward Guy, a first responder at the crime scene, in an email to The Phillipian.\n“The safety and security of our citizens is of utmost importance and the Andover Police Department is committed to investigating and prosecuting those involved with this brazen act to the fullest extent of the law,” he continued.\nThe police began their investigation of the incident after a woman placed a 911 call at 10:22 p.m., “reporting that her son was shot and en route to the hospital,” according to police logs.\nThe victims then made their way to a duplex across the street, where a friend drove them to the hospital.\nThe Lawrence General Hospital later notified the A.P.D. that the men, both Andover residents and in their 20s, had arrived with gunshot wounds, according a press release from the A.P.D.\nFour officers responded to the scene of the incident, which was about 1.3 miles away from Andover’s main campus. Two detectives were also dispatched to interview the victims at the hospital.\nIn an update, the A.P.D. said that police investigators have yet to disclose the names of the two victims, who were released from the hospital on Friday afternoon.\n“We do not believe that there is any danger to the community at large,” said Andover Police Chief Patrick Keefe in an official statement.\n“Right now, this investigation is just beginning, and we greatly appreciate everyone’s patience while the victims are tended to, and we work to determine who is responsible for this act of violence in our community,” said Chief Keefe.\nShawsheen Plaza is home to numerous stores and restaurants, including Stop & Shop, Raagini Indian Bistro, and Planet Fitness.\nAlthough most businesses were closing or closed at the time of the shooting, Debbie McNiff, a manager at Grassfields Steak & Seafood, said that local businesses were notified of the incident by the A.P.D.\n“[The police] told us about keeping the back door locked and that there was an incident across the street…They [asked us for surveillance footage], but we don’t have surveillance headed toward that part of the building,” said McNiff in an interview with The Phillipian.\nDemetri Photis, a worker at the Shawsheen Plaza Sunoco across the street from the duplex, had closed his shop before the shooting occurred and heard about the incident the next morning.\n“I believe there were still police officers on the scene [the morning after] investigating and locking the place down,” said Photis.\nPhotis also said that there had been recent instances of crime in the area. In June, the same Sunoco station was robbed by a man with a knife, according to a report by “The Eagle Tribune.”\nDespite recent incidents at Andover or near Shawsheen Plaza, the town has experienced an overall decrease in crimes since 2010.\n“Violent crime is very rare in Andover. We have not seen an increase in violent crime and specifically the North Main Street area,” said Guy.\xa0 \xa0\nJohn Moreland ’18, a day student who lives in Andover said, in an interview with The Phillipian, “[The shooting] is unbelievably surprising because I’ve grown up here my entire life and traditionally nothing really goes wrong in Andover. It’s this cute little town, [it’s] safe, and there are no cares as to what might ever happen. I’ve never felt unsafe walking down the street, so that’s really surprising,” said Moreland.\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nAn official revote on the 4×5 schedule has been scheduled by Head of School John Palfrey in response to the discouraging results of the recent advisory vote. According to an email from Palfrey to the faculty, 61 percent (123 votes) of the faculty voted against the 4×5, while 36 percent (72 votes) approved, and 3 percent (6 votes) abstained. This is a drastic shift from the 119 votes for and 89 votes against the 4×5 cast during the original vote last January. \nIf the faculty votes against the January 2016 binding decision, the 2017-2018 school year will not adopt a new schedule. In this case, a revised schedule will be implemented in either fall 2018 or fall 2019.\nPalfrey wrote in an email to the faculty on Wednesday, “I will issue a new ballot for a formal reconsideration of the binding vote of January 2016 in favor of implementing the 4×5 this coming fall. Made available shortly and coming to you under separate cover, this new ballot will be available for 48 hours beginning this evening and running through Friday evening.”\nThe ballot is projected to have two options: a “yes” vote on the 4×5 or a “no” vote. A majority of “yes” votes would mean that Andover would carry on as planned with the 4×5 at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year. A majority of “no” votes would lead to the cancellation of the 4×5 and the end of scheduling talks for the winter term. \nIn place of the 4×5, the school would plan a schedule for next year similar to the current one, tweaking the current schedule only in ways that affect Empathy and Balance pilots. Palfrey further described that the school will “resume scheduling work under a new committee this spring.”\nBy way of the advisory vote, faculty and staff also shared their concerns with and suggestions for the 4×5 schedule implementation. According to the email from Palfrey, many expressed “the desire for improvements” to the schedule, but opposed specific changes that the 4×5 schedule was anticipated to bring in the 2017 year.\n“To quote one colleague (whose name I do not know): ‘This is a difficult vote for me, because I want to express my strong support for a change of schedule, but I do not think the 4×5 is the right change to make. My understanding is that a ‘no’ vote can still be a vote for a change of schedule (even, perhaps, as soon as next year).’ Many comments echoed a version of this sentiment,” Palfrey said.\n“I asked the faculty to advise me on their thinking in light of the detailed work that we all have done over the past year to refine the schedule and calendar,” wrote Palfrey in an email to The Phillipian. “Regardless of the outcome of the reconsideration ballot, we will keep working to come up with the best schedule and calendar for Andover and its students, consistent with the direction of our strategic plan.”\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nStorming into the office of John DeGioia, President of Georgetown University, Kory Stuer ’15 and 16 other students executed what would become the culmination of their protest against the school’s licensing agreement with Nike. Lasting 35 hours, the sit-in began last Thursday morning and did not end until the students and administration reached an agreement on the future of Georgetown’s partnership with Nike. \nAccording to Stuer, the licensing agreement between Georgetown and Nike, expiring at the end of this year, states that Nike can license out Georgetown’s logo and manufacture Georgetown apparel. In October 2015, the Workers Rights Consortium discovered that thousands of workers in Nike’s Hansae factory in Vietnam quit their jobs because of an abusive working environment. Workers were found locked in the building, forced to work overtime in a room hotter than 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n“Nike said that [the workers] were walking off because they hadn’t gotten the bonus pays they wanted, but we found out that that was clearly not true,” said Stuer. “This walkoff is especially meaningful because, in Vietnam, it’s illegal to organize like that, so they walk off under threat of death. That’s how serious these conditions were.”\nSince then, numerous Georgetown students, including Stuer, have attempted to cut Georgetown’s contract with Nike. Early November this year, over a hundred members of the community called directly into the president’s office, asking DeGioia to take action. The students also created the social media campaign “Better Barefoot Than Nike,” for which many students chose to walk around barefoot for three days to raise awareness, each day asking a new member of the faculty to join them.\n“Since November 2015, [we’ve been] in meetings with the administration, trying to get them to hold Nike accountable and force them to do better, because an important thing to recognize is that Nike is getting worse in terms of its labor practices. It was about bringing things back where it used to be – which was by no means good – but we were trying to make things less bad,” said Stuer. “We did various things trying to demonstrate to the administration that we cared about this both inside meetings with them and outside of that. They really weren’t as receptive to that as we needed them to be.” \nAccording to Stuer, “Occupied until DeGioia cuts Nike” was hung outside of DeGioia’s office window in Healy Hall, overlooking the foyer where a crowd gathered for a solidarity rally at noon in support of the students in the sit-in. Matching Christmas tunes with political lyrics, a hundred students, faculty, and campus workers sang “we wish you would cut the contact” instead of “we wish you a Merry Christmas.”\nDiego Blandon ’15, who was present at the protest said: “The protesters elicited a very positive response from the administration regarding the status of the contract. This was definitely a step in the right direction. However, I strongly believe that punishing students for standing against oppression and injustice around the world is antithetical to Georgetown’s values.” \n“[They] came and spoke and chanted. I think that while it was very serious, we were also having a certain degree of fun with it and making sure we were keeping our spirits high and that we were in it for the long haul and ready to stay as long as needed,” said Stuer.\nA group of nine students left the sit-in Thursday night due to the risk of receiving disciplinary action. Stuer and the remaining seven students were denied access to additional food and water or blankets and pillows by the university as they spent the night in DeGioia’s office. According to Stuer, due to lack of warmth and food, one student became ill and left the protest as well. \n“People tried to bring in food and water to us but we were not allowed that, so we were just relying on what we came in with. They had blocked [other people] off from us and we had begun to run out of food, but we were willing to stay there as long as it took. If that meant that we ran out of food, that meant that we ran out of food. Because while we were concerned about our health, we were more concerned about the health of the thousands of workers in Vietnam because something that I know [is that] we, all of us, were [more concerned about] the commitment to these workers. It wasn’t about us; it was about them,” said Stuer.\nFinally, on Friday night, the remaining seven students walked out of DeGioia’s office with smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes after hearing that Georgetown had agreed not to continue its licensing contract with Nike unless the company gives the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring organization, full access to all their factories.\n“I felt pretty happy and proud to have been part of this… You can make change. It is about standing up and recognizing that taking direct action has an impact. [Andover] is not a perfect institution and there are changes that should happen… You really can stand up and make a change when you see the need for it. I hope that student activists at Andover, recognizing that, can make those changes happen at Andover as well,” said Stuer.\nStudents who participated in the sit-in broadcasted their negotiations with the administration, and conducted “news reports,” live from the president’s office through their Facebook page “Georgetown Solidarity Committee.” They used the account to share their beliefs with the greater Georgetown community and outside world. \nMalika Dia ’17 agreed with many of the committee’s objectives. \n“I found out what happened with [Stuer] mostly through his own social media networks. I really admire him for the progress he has made. One of the major things that I admire about this whole situation is that Georgetown is so incredibly rooted in tradition… I think that it was really cool that [Stuer] was able to maintain those values and was also able to stand up. I think that is really cool and admirable of him,” said Dia.\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nFor Justice Robinson ’18, “stay woke” is one of the mantras that she will remember most from her trip this past week to the Student Diversity Leadership Conference (S.D.L.C.) in Atlanta, Ga. \n“It means stay aware to what is going on around you,” said Robinson. “Don’t let the systems of oppression and effects of privilege get past you. Stay woke, don’t sleep, be aware of what’s going on.”\nRobinson, along with Bennett Sherr ’17, Abdu Donka ’18, Cindy Espinosa ’18, Allison Zhu ’19, and chaperones LaShawn Springer, Director of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD); Karina Hernandez-Guarniz, Associate Director of College Counseling; and LaShonda Long, Instructor in English, attended S.D.L.C., a three-day conference in which over 1,600 students gather to discuss topics surrounding identity and inclusivity in schools.\xa0\nStudents attended from various private and independent schools across the country to participate in the nearly 25-year-old annual conference hosted by the National Association for Independent Schools. \n“We were able to talk about race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, ability, family structure, and many other aspects of our identity and get to hear stories from people across the country,” wrote Sherr in an email to The Phillipian. “The general atmosphere at the conference [was] one of compassion and respect.”\nDuring the conference, the students were split up into “family” groups of approximately 70 to 90 people named after famous activists and “home” groups of around 10 people. Some Andover students served as peer facilitators in these groups leading the conversations at the daily check-ins of home groups. \nFor Sherr, the most rewarding part of the conference was the selection of affinity groups.\n“I went to the queer affinity group, and I honestly had such an amazing time. It was incredible to see the amount of trust each person had in one another and how easily we were all able to relate because of our shared experiences. As people came out, members of the group who were already out, including myself, applauded and cheered for the people that stood up in front of the group,” said Sherr.\nAfter attending the conference and speaking to students from other boarding schools, Donka believes that Andover is more progressive than other schools in terms of inclusivity.\n“From all the different places I found that Andover was ahead and really unique, especially with how they set up MLK Day and how there’s a lot of programs and affinity groups in CAMD to help students that are engaged in this school,” said Donka.\nThe S.D.L.C. trip for Andover students has become an annual tradition, financed by a grant that is applied for and obtained yearly from the Abbot Academy Association. This year, Donka, who applied and was granted an Abbot Grant in Spring Term, then coordinated the event alongside CAMD, and students underwent an application process to attend.\nAccording to the attendants of the conference interviewed by The Phillipian, many of them hope to bring what they learned at S.D.L.C. and have it discussed on campus. \n“I think it’s very imperative that we, as people that went to conference, use what we got from other people,” said Robinson. “I think it’s even more important to take what we learned from the students we were talking to with their experiences in their school system and their experience with oppression. Taking [the experience] to heart and turning it into something that we can apply to our own school.”\n\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nIt might be cold and chilly outside, but the spirit of creativity brought warmth to the Makerspace this Wednesday afternoon during the Holiday Maker Bash, a festive event featuring some of the most advanced machines on campus. The Bash encouraged students to interact with the technology the Nest has to offer in interesting ways that allowed students to de-stress before break.\nSome students considered the highlight of the event to be the use of Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that the Makerspace recently purchased. Because of their positive experience at the Bash, some students see themselves taking their interests to the next level. \nAnushree Gupta ’18 said, “The Oculus was great. It was very interesting that you could be transported into virtual reality, and it seemed really real. I am gonna consider going to the club that let us use it on a more regular basis.”\nAlthough it has been been a staple of the Makerspace since last year, many students have yet to be formerly familiarized with the laser cutter. The Holiday Maker Bash offered an opportunity for them to learn about this machine and produce a craft to bring home to family. \nNeil Thorley ’19 said, “I haven’t had as much of a chance to use that [the laser cutter] as I would like, and it was nice to finally get to try it out and learn how it works and makes something awesome. I made an ornament for my Christmas break [today].”\nTessa Conrardy ’20 also enjoyed using the laser cutter. She said, “It’s kind of interesting because you can put things in 2-D format and have to think about it in a 3-D sense, and how to transition from 2D to 3D and utilizing the laser cutter to do that. It’s kind of like a cool technology in a cool mindset.”\nStudents of different levels of involvement in the Makerspace showed up at the event. Some had had extended experience working there.\n“I come in here almost everyday for something or another. My goal is to learn how to use all the machines in here by the end of the year. I’ve learned how to sew, how to use the laser cutter, how to use the 3-D printer. I haven’t done any of that before I came here. It’s really fun,” said Conrardy.\nOthers, like Riley Edsall ’20, might have only used the space for studying prior to the event. He said, “Occasionally I will come in here because it’s a nice and quiet place to study, but usually I don’t have much interaction here.” \nMichael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information, and Library Services, was delighted to see new faces to the Nest at the Bash. Barker recognizes a group of “return customers” who use the Makerspace on a regular basis, but says he is eager to grow the pool of students who utilize the tools frequently.\n“We like what we’re seeing. But we always want to grow that pool, that community of people, as much as possible. Events like this [Holiday Maker Bash] kind of help because it’s just come on down, try some of the equipment, have some fun, meet some people, all of that,” said Barker. \nClaudia Wessner, Makerspace Coordinator and Lead Experience Designer, agrees with the importance of making the space more accessible to the community. \n“We are constantly trying to reach out to different groups of students, to make it a place where everyone can come. This place is for all students. We want you to come in here. If you don’t know what this space is all about, you can talk to me and find out how to use it, how to use the tools. Even if you think you can’t do any of this, I am pretty sure that we can find something that you can do absolutely, and you can learn the stuff,” said Wessner.\nOther than the Holiday Maker Bash, the Makerspace has planned many events to encourage students to take full advantage of the space. \n“We run lots of one on one workshops, some skill workshops. We have NestEd events for people to come and just listen to somebody that’s doing something in the makerspace kind of zone. We try to run events that are open to anybody,” said Barker.\n“Just recently the sewing and knitting club are gonna come, and they have started to do their making in the space. I think we should just do more of it. More art, more crafts, just have fun doing this, and eventually we will learn something doing it, and it will be a creative adventure,” he continued.\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nHeads bent over computer screens, furiously typing out lines of code, members of the Computer Science (C.S.) Club gathered in The Nest to participate in Code.org’s fourth ever Hour of Code. While most schools use the programs offered by Code.org to teach classes, the C.S. Club decided to teach a one-hour course on their own coding program. \nDarius Lam ’17, Co-President of the C.S. Club, said, “Our society is becoming more and more built on technology, and specifically computer technology… In other fields as well, being able to use programming is incredibly important, in the medical field, what runs M.R.I. machines, surgery robots – it’s all programming.”\nThe C.S. Club has hosted the Hour of Code on campus since its creation three years ago. The goal of the Hour of Code, according to members of the C.S. Club, is to teach both beginner and advanced-level coding programs and to spark interest in computer programming. \nThe Hour of Code is an international event that occurs each year during Computer Education Week, this year taking place from December 5-11. Code.org, a non-profit that offers free coding games and courses, established the event in order to inspire students to code by providing operational support of one-hour courses at schools that agree to participate.\nLam started the event by offering to teach a course to beginner-level coders. He soon realized, however, that only experienced coders had attended the seminar, and he proceeded to teach a coding sequence on computer-animated fireworks instead.\nMiles McCain ’19, a member of C.S. Club who attended the Hour of Code, described why he believes events that teach computer programming are significant.\n“I think that because our society is so dependent on technology, it’s important for everyone to at least understand how the underlying systems work. I don’t think it’s necessarily important for them to be able to create them themselves, but I think that having a general understanding is necessary, and knowing the basics of coding, is sufficient,” said McCain.\nNicholas Zufelt, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and Faculty Advisor to the C.S. Club, supervised and supported the event. \n“I think it’s extremely empowering to start [coding]. I think that it is a skill students can pick up either in class, or not in class, they can constantly get better at it, it’s something they can feel proud of, and it is applicable to essentially every area of their life in our extremely connected world,” said Zufelt.\nR. PremThe Hour of Code is currently held in over 180 countries with basic tutorials available in 45 different languages.\n\nMany members of the C.S. Club expressed that the relatively small turnout of the event was not what they had hoped for or expected. Lam described that finding beginner interest has been an ongoing challenge for the C.S. Club, as well as the irony in having no beginners show up to an event designed for teaching beginners to code. \n“This is something that’s been plaguing the Computer Science Club for a while, which is, we want to make it accessible to everybody. Not just people who are super interested in math, not just people who are super interested in science,” said Lam.\nLam also described the difficulties he faces when teaching coding, and how it can be challenging to simultaneously teach students who have varying levels of experience. \n“We want to keep everybody engaged and involved, and it’s difficult when people come with so many different experience levels. If they’re really experienced and they show up and we teach an intro to Python, they think it’s not interesting and they leave. But if we start out with a very advanced topic, the beginners can’t keep up and then they feel like it’s not accessible to them,” said Lam.\nDespite this, Lam maintains a positive attitude.\n“I think in the future [turnout] might get better, especially as our Computer Science Department gets bigger, as more people get interested in it. So yeah, disappointing now but I’m not worried,” Lam said.\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nShoot, slide, tap. It takes less than ten seconds for\xa0 student to use Snapchat to instantaneously document their daily lives. The social media platform allows for students to communicate with people from all around the globe, while having the ability to customize their experience with geotags and filters.\nClusters, dorms, and events at Andover have been known for creating specific geotags, whether the geofilter at this year’s Andover/Exeter tournaments, or the campus-wide filter of Samuel Phillips Hall. Every cluster on campus except for West Quad North has developed a geofilter. \nAlly Klionsky ’17, the creator of Pine Knoll Cluster’s geofilter, said, “Abbot Cluster came up with a geotag, and I was walking downtown and I saw it show up on my phone, and I was really excited and I already created the PKN logo, so I went on snapchat.com, to their geofilter submission page, and I just quickly uploaded the image, and it got accepted.”\n“I like [the PKN geotag] better than the regular Andover one, and I just like the PKN symbol.

The Ugly Sweater Party hosted on Saturday was adorned with a geofilter of Christmas lights, created by Sarah Choi ’18 and Ale Macaya ’18. The Andover community has seen the tendency of geofilters becoming a tradition for annual events, as every year there is a new Andover/Exeter geofilter for the weekend’s events.\n“People were really excited about [the geofilter] and were using it, and so it was a great experience. Basically incorporated with a semi opaque background filter, I typed in Andover related texts. People in Exeter were also using the geotag too, so it was really exciting. [Geotags] make everything seem more exciting, and that’s definitely true with the Andover/Exeter geotag. It was really exciting and made people hyped up for games,” said Klionsky, who also created last year’s Andover/Exeter geofilter. \nMax Rigby-Hall ’18, who attended the Ugly Sweater Party and used the geofilter, said, “I think geofilters are becoming more and more popular because it’s an easy way to add more color and fun to your Snapchats. It’s kind of like a special thing that only you and the people and the event can see. Everyone wants to get the geofilter so they can put it on their story and be one of the few who saw it.”\nWest Quad South’s geofilter was designed by Sam Bloom ’18, who brainstormed ideas within WQS’s Cluster Counsel before taking her ideas to Adobe Photoshop. A launch party was held for the filter at the end of last term, and Bloom plans to launch another geofilter she designed for the cluster after break.\n“It was a cool addition to add the the cluster, other clusters already had one, and I figured, ‘why not have one too?’ It was also a way to bring people to West Quad South, because it’s not really in the center of campus,” said Bloom. “We met at cluster council a couple times, and everyone just discussed what they wanted to see, but I had pretty much creative control over the whole thing.”\nThe Addison Gallery of American Art is currently holding a contest for students to design a geofilter to represent the museum, that will be active during the Addison’s Wednesday evening hours. \nSnapchat is also a different way of expressing students’ identity by decorating a picture with filters. For many students, geofilters encourage students to feel more involved with Andover. \n“You definitely have a sense of pride, when you’re able to post your story and share with your friends and they can see [Andover’s] geotag,” said Klionsky.\nRamdhany Correa said, “I would definitely be [interested in new geotags of Andover], especially like the clubs I am part of, and like the different sports I do. It just like really unites like a group of people in whatever community they are in.”\nAs Snapchat constantly develops numerous filters and geotags that users can enjoy, Andover students can create and submit their own geofilters of Andover’s campus to be reviewed and further implemented. \nTyler Yung ’20 said, “Snapchat is very fun and easy to enjoy because you don’t have to type anything. Just two touches send a photo… The greatest advantage [of Snapchat] is that it is interesting and gives me constant joy getting connected with my friends in a unique way.”\nEditor’s Note: Ally Klionsky is an Executive Digital Editor of The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Dec 16, 2016'), ('\nThe Abbot Academy Association (AAA) released its list of 25 funded student and faculty proposals, with this term’s grants totaling 192,913 dollars. The Association awards funding to student and faculty initiatives after applicants submit an extensive proposal and present before the AAA board at an Association dinner. The Association was founded in 1973 to provide funding for projects “consistent with the traditions and ideals of Abbot Academy and the current needs of Phillips Academy,” according to the Andover website. The projects featured below represent only a fraction of the grant proposals that received full or partial funding.\n\xa0\nPAshion Print Fashion Magazine\nPAshion Print Fashion Magazine, a new club and student publication run by Emelie Eldracher ’18, Nell Fitts ’18, and Claire Jungmann ’18, was given funds to help pay for professional printing. The print and website-based magazine focuses on fashion on and off campus. With the help of the Abbot Grant, the club plans to produce paper copies of its magazine. In an email to The Phillipian, Jungmann wrote, “We really wanted to create a physical copy of the magazine and we’re so excited that we are able to actually realize the idea. We hope to have more than 20 full-color pages that will look like a professional magazine.” The club also plans to sell advertisements to local businesses and start a sustainable publication.\n\xa0\nGirls Who Lift Initiative — Equipment for the Fitness Center\nSofie Brown ’18, Makenna Marshall ’18, and Elizabeth Seero ’18 recently received an Abbot Grant for their club, Girls Who Lift. The club’s primary purpose is to “make girls feel safe and accepted in the weightlifting section of the gym,” said Marshall. “We’re hoping that by exercising in large groups, [they] can get a safe workout culture going.” The club needed money for equipment appropriate for beginners, as those currently in the gym are not. The club requested lighter weights, such as a 15 pound bar instead of a 45 pound bar, to properly instruct students. With the grant money, the club will now have the means to cover these expenses and teach girls how to lift. “I feel great,” said Marshall. “I’m really glad it worked out. We all worked really hard on the planning and the research for it.”\n\xa0\nStudent-Run Engineering Research Project\nKevin Kastholm ’17, Matthew Grottkau ’17, and Sarah Choi ’18 were granted funds for a student run engineering research project that will focus on technical projects designed to expose students to different types of engineering. In the fall, they held a bridge building competition, and they hope to start a collaborative project utilizing the grant money in the next two terms. “The Abbot Grant will help because doing a hands-on project requires materials, and, in this case, we’re trying to do an alternative energy project and materials, such as a solar panels, are very expensive,” said Kastholm. “We’re very fortunate because if we didn’t receive [the grant money] then we wouldn’t be able to do these types of projects.”\n\xa0\nSelf-Defense Program Aimed Toward Female Students\nJennifer Lee ’18, Alexandra Loumidis ’18, and Clarisa Merkatz ’19 received an Abbot Grant for the Girls’ Global Health Club. In an interview with The Phillipian, Loumidis said that, with the money, they are hoping to “provide an outlet on campus for girls to learn more about both physical and mental health. In the spring, [we’re] planning on doing various different wellness activities. [Our] overall goal is to make female students feel more comfortable on this campus.” With the Abbot Grant, the club will be able to fund self-defense classes. Lee also sees it as a sign of support. “It is a way for the school to show support for our club’s message, and the goals of our club in terms of making [it] a more welcoming and inclusive place for students of all identities,” said Lee. “It also provides a platform for us to share what we’re passionate about with others in this community.”\n\xa0\nPhillips Academy Interscholastic Student Film Festival\nHoping to host a film festival at Andover involving students from other schools, Alexander Emerson ’17, Andrew Lin ’17, and Nicholas Emerson ’20 were given a grant for the Movie Maker’s Club. In an interview with The Phillipian, Lin said, “We’ve been planning this event for a while as a club, but it never really came through. A couple of years ago, Alex and I went to the National Film Festival for Talented Youth. It was really cool and we’re looking at some aspects of that film festival to help build ours.” Submissions are opening up January 1st for students who would like to submit an original movie of their own. “One of the main reasons we applied for the Abbot Grant is because we don’t want to have an admissions fee, so we’re looking to build on Non Sibi in some ways… It’ll also cover food, event costs, the Polks’s equipment, and the website. We’re going to host the website in order to display the films,” said Lin.\n\xa0\nMIT Sports Analytics Conference\xa0\nRolando Rabines ’19 received an Abbot Grant for his plan to take students to the MIT sports Analytics Conference. The event will include a panel made up of general managers of sports teams and author of “Moneyball,” Michael Lewis. In an interview with The Phillipian, Rabines said, “My inspiration for the project was really my love for analytics. I wanted to raise awareness for sports analytics at Andover, a school currently lagging behind in sports analytics technologies.” This project is aimed towards benefiting Andover athletes, students, and faculty. “The vision is to have Sports Analytics Managers on every varsity team at Andover, and instead of passing waters and moving cones, [managers would be] crunching numbers to bring a competitive advantage to Andover’s sports teams while also allowing for the Andover community to learn about analytics and its quantitative uses,” said Rabines. The club has already purchased tickets to go to to the conference on March 4, 2017.\n\xa0\nDevelopment of Female Wrestling Program at Andover\nIn an effort to further develop Andover’s female wrestling program, Kassie Archambault ’06 and Rich Gorham ’86 intend to use their money to host wrestling clinics with Olympic Gold Medalist Helen Maroulis and Olympian Elena Pirozhkova. After receiving an Abbot Grant last year, they are looking to continue informing girls who may not realize wrestling is an option for them. In an email to The Phillipian, Archambault, who is the coach of Andover Wrestling’s girls program wrote, “Female wrestling is the fastest growing sport for girls in the country, yet there’s still a stigma around it.” The coaches are also planning on participating in the national tournament later in the year.\n\xa0\nEditor’s Note: Jennifer Lee ’18 is an Associate Sports Editor and Alexandra Loumidis ’18 is an Associate Business Manager for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Dec 13, 2016'), ('\nElectric-powered golf carts, all brandishing stickers reading “100% Electric Power,” are driven around campus on a daily basis as part of the sustainability movement at Andover. Charging ports for the electrical vehicles (EV) have also been widely implemented around campus, most notably at Phelps House where Head of School John Palfrey charges his personal electrical vehicle. The addition of EVs to Andover’s campus fleet accommodates the grounds, technology, and athletic departments, as well as the Sykes Wellness Center for transportation for off-campus medical situations.\n“Because [EVs] are powered by electricity, and because our electricity grid is getting cleaner and more renewable, electric vehicles have less emissions… and they also are able to take the energy from electricity and use it much more efficiently than a gasoline or a diesel vehicle. There’s also just some economic benefits from it,” said Allison Guerette, Campus Sustainability Coordinator.\nThe “Sustainability Team” on campus is comprised of Guerette and Russell Stott, both Senior Managers of Campus Design, Sustainability, and Grounds. Both work with a Sustainability Steering Committee and Climate Action Plan Working group, comprised of faculty and staff with the intent of spearheading numerous efforts toward a more sustainable campus.\nWith the Campus Master Plan, a framework for decision making that allows for campus renovations, in mind, the Office of the Physical Plant (OPP) works to implement more Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications. OPP is another team on campus that works towards sustainability.\nThe use of renovation projects enables an increase in energy efficiency, further conservation of water, and minimization of waste, in addition to preserving the natural landscape. Some LEED-certified buildings on campus include Paresky Commons and the Sykes Wellness Center. A building is LEED-certified when it consumes less energy and is considered resource-efficient by a national standard. The new Snyder Athletic Center will also pursue a ranking.\n“[The LEED-certification] is a ranking system so that when you’re designing the building, you’re thinking about how is energy going to be used in the building, are the systems efficient… It’s very technical… It’s pretty strenuous to achieve and it takes a real commitment. It’s not just lip service, it’s a nationally-recognized program,” said Guerette.\nAdditionally, behavioral changes require a campus effort to increase awareness on sustainability issues and take action to eliminate wasteful habits.\n“All over campus, there are these little efforts that are cropping up that are changing behaviors. Sometimes, it’s not always with sustainability as the main reason. It may be some reason to save money or just because something’s the right thing to do, and so people come at it from different places. It all comes together to increase the overall sustainability of the campus,” said Stott in an interview with The Phillipian.\nRaising awareness is also a huge factor in increasing sustainability. Guerette and Stott partner frequently with the Eco-Action Club on-campus, which work on developing ideas into hands-on projects in the community. Eco-Action sponsored the Gunga Energy Challenge this past year, in which dorms competed campus-wide to regulate their energy consumptions.\n“Early in the fall, we welcomed [her] at a club meeting where [Guerette] gave an inspiring presentation outlining all the initiatives and plans to promote sustainability on campus. Soon after, Ms. Guerette and Ms. Elliott informed the Eco-Action club about excessive plastic bottle consumption in certain dorms. As a result, our board members traveled to certain dorms and shared our motivations for reducing plastic bottle consumption,” said Gherardo Morona ’17, a member of the Eco-Action club.\nKrystiana Swain ’18 believes that the topic of sustainability should be more frequent in student discussions, which would consequently increase participation and student involvement in sustainability efforts.\n“From the students at least, I haven’t seen much of a big push for sustainability or anything. It’s not something that comes up in everyday conversation and it doesn’t seem to be one of our focuses… It’s not big enough among the students, we don’t have enough exposure to it,” said Swain.\nBeing aware of portion sizes at Paresky would also be a dramatic influence on food waste.\nThompson Uwanomen ’19 said, “I would say the most wasteful thing on campus would be the food from Paresky Commons. I tend to see large pieces of bread, or chicken, or rice just thrown out, or put back on the conveyor belt… That’s basically just an abundance of food gone to waste… I know they can’t physically make students stop wasting food, that’s impossible, but try to make students more aware of the fact that they shouldn’t take as much food as they thought, and when they finished eating, they had a lot of food left… Only eat the amount of food that they know they will finish.”\nSmall personal changes also go long ways for a more sustainable campus. Stott describes actions such as closing the window during heating season, turning off power strips when a dorm room is vacant, carrying reusable water bottles, and taking shorter showers as ways to decrease the ecological footprint.\n“There’s all these little things that anybody can do. Together, they make this huge impact… and it doesn’t just impact here, it impacts when people go home to their families, and into the future when they have their own families. They will kind of have been set on this course where it’s a part of their life,” said Guerette.\n\n', 'Dec 9, 2016'), ('\nCurved and dangling with blue beads and soft white fur, the Chipewyan object on display at the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology researched by Lydia Paris ’17 looks quite different from traditional western ideas of a smoking pipe. After weeks of research, she discovered the pipe was passed around by traders who didn’t see it in the sacred context of Native American spirituality, which illuminated a history of disrespect for Native American artifacts and culture. \n“George Grinnell was the original anthropologist [of my object]. He didn’t send it to a museum. He sent it to be traded. So he was not using it for a sacred purpose. He was using it for profit. So I think that was something really interesting… I think a lot of it comes down to disrespect for Native American [religions],” said Paris.\nHaving spent weeks planning and organizing an exhibit, the students in Kurt Prescott’s “Religion in America: One Nation, Under God(s)?” class can finally call themselves museum curators. The students spent the last three weeks of fall term conducting intense research on an arctic or subarctic artifact in the Peabody Museum. During the process, they researched their object’s origins, provenance, sacred significance, and how it came into the hands of the museum. \nStudents gathered their research into a paper on the significance of their object, covering everything from the item’s journey to the Peabody to its importance in the religion of its original tribe. From their essays, the students enveloped all of the information into a 50-word descriptive blurb that would explain the object to the general public so that it could be shown off in an exhibit. \nPrescott, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies, developed the idea for this project over the summer with Ryan Wheeler, Director of the Peabody Museum. \nThe class was focused on religion in America, which for Prescott was an interesting opportunity to incorporate sacred Native American artifacts held at the Peabody into his project. Grace Anthony ’17 was grateful to have the opportunity to work with her object, a bone fishhook, at the museum.\n“I think it’s really cool that we have [the Peabody] on campus,” said Anthony. “I don’t think it’s used enough… It is a resource to see something real that applies to your learning. It does have a very nice department. It is a lot of Native American tribal stuff that they have there. That is not always covered in our history classes but that is something we can talk about,” said Anthony.\nThroughout the project, the class learned more about the process of how museums gather and store information, as they had to conduct the majority of their research on their objects via outside sources. \nStudents helped develop the Peabody’s records of the objects they researched, making many discoveries previously unknown to the museum’s curators themselves.\n“I was really impressed by some of the things that they figured out. And it was really an opportunity for me to learn more about them. Some of the collections came from expeditions, but there were also some that were gifts. And so it was fascinating to see how they found their way to us and learn a little bit more about them,” said Wheeler.\nWhen Prescott first came up with this assignment over the summer, he knew it would be difficult, but he was also excited to see how his students would work together with the staff at the Peabody.\n“When you’re assigned a bone fishhook, you can be like, ‘Okay what is this boring research paper.’ But I think what they found is that the object in and of itself often defied whatever their expectations were of it… you suddenly discover [an artifact was] mis-categorized by the Peabody and it’s actually a pendant that you would’ve worn on the bottom of a skirt to help keep your legs warm,” said Prescott.\nPrescott believes that the project was a success, and he will continue to work with and build upon it in the coming years.\nThe artifacts and the students’ short descriptions are currently on display in the Peabody. \n\n', 'Dec 9, 2016'), ('\nWhen Alex Ma ’17 first came to Andover as a new international student from Beijing, she found herself struggling to adjust and sought counseling from a faculty at Graham House, Andover’s mental health facility prior to Sykes Wellness Center. However, East-Asian International students, despite comprising a large portion of students who suffer from mental health issues, often do not seek the help they need, according to Ma.\n“In terms of mental health, a higher percentage of East-Asian international students experience mental health issues than any other group of students in the U.S.,” said Ma. “However, despite higher rates of mental health issues, they are also the least likely students to seek help from a professional mental health counselor.”\nAfter conducting extensive research, discussing with over a hundred people, and writing a comprehensive paper, Ma stood in front of a large crowd last Friday at Kemper auditorium for her Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar presentation. \nMa’s presentation, entitled “Fresh off the Boat: Examining Mental Health Risk Factors and Counseling Barriers Among East Asian International Students,” discussed the cultural and personal blocks that prevent East-Asian students at Andover from seeking necessary help to combat stress and mental health problems. \nMa described how her personal experience as an East-Asian International Student, alongside those of her peers coming from similar backgrounds, inspired her to pursue this topic. She outlined how different attitudes toward counseling in many East-Asian cultures prevent students from seeking help. Ma also mentioned that East-Asian culture has a tendency of keeping quiet about personal problems, especially relating to mental health. \n“I was an international student from China and the transition was really hard for me… Graham House ended up being really helpful, but I felt like my friends who had similar backgrounds and experienced similar issues didn’t always use Graham House, and I wanted to look deeper into that,” said Ma in an interview with The Phillipian. \nAfter outlining the factors that prevent students from reaching for help, Ma proposed potential solutions for adjusting this pressing issue. In particular, she emphasized a need for both individual and institutional changes to ensure that students have a better understanding of mental health resources available. \n“One barrier to counseling is that students feel uncomfortable opening up to a stranger. Opportunities can be made for the entire Sykes Counseling and Wellness team to introduce themselves to the students. This could be done directly to the entire student body in meetings such as ASM or special class meetings, or it could be done through intimate dorm and advising group talks,” Ma said. \nMa also encouraged student leaders to assist students around them who might be suffering from mental health issues in seeking necessary help from Sykes.\n“In order to reinforce the social acceptability of counseling, students must lead their peers by example. This includes student leaders, such as prefects or team captains, encouraging members of their halls or teams to visit Sykes when they come to them with a problem, rather than suggesting that they just sleep it off or talk to a friend about it,” said Ma.\n“Another way for students to feel less shame and self-doubt in facing mental health issues is to realize that other students are also experiencing similar things,” she continued.\nJungwoo Park ’19, an attendee of the presentation, said, “I realized a lot of the basic issues that international students face that I wasn’t aware of, and it got me thinking and taught me a lot about concrete efforts and steps that we as a community can take to combat these issues that these students face.”\nThrough her research, Ma hoped to educate students on and raise awareness for an issue that is not widely discussed. She also sought to help dismantle the stigma surrounding counseling for mental health issues.\n“I think that the main goal of my presentation was to show students, especially East-Asian international students, but just anyone who felt that they couldn’t talk about their mental health issues… [that] their experiences are valid and that they could actually reach out for help,” said Ma in an interview with The Phillipian. \n“It didn’t matter if they experienced stress once a term or all the time, they could ask for help and they weren’t alone. And I hope I came off as someone who could be an ally to these people and who they could come up to and talk to about this,” she continued. \nMa concluded her presentation praising Andover’s continual effort. However, she highlighted that the school must still work towards making every student comfortable in receiving and reaching out for a variety of resources.\n“[Andover], in comparison to many other schools, has exceeded in providing academic and mental health support systems to relieve students of stress and other mental health issues. However, this is the difference between achieving equality and achieving equity,” said Ma.\n“Equity entails that everyone feels the same amount of confidence and comfort in using these resources. In this respect, I think that more can be done to empower not just East Asian international students, but any students who avoid counseling due to stigma and misperception,” she continued.\xa0\n\n', 'Dec 9, 2016'), ('\nAbbot Research, Science, Innovation and Engineering Society (A-RISE) is a new initiative at Andover that focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) subjects on campus. As Andover’s first-ever science research society, this new program will look to engage in team-oriented, collaborative science and engineering projects that will be recognized on a national and international level through various STEM competitions.\nSydney Marler ’18, the founder of the A-RISE initiative and recipient of a 4,300-dollar Abbot Grant, saw a lack of accessibility to student-driven science research opportunities on campus. During her Upper year, she took the initiative to make such research a possibility for the Andover community. \n“The idea arose out of observing the polarized inequality in access and opportunity for scientific research. For example, formal summer research programs cost upwards of thousands of dollars and students living in rural areas with no access to nearby research facilities are effectively shut out of the entire experience,” said Marler in an email to The Phillipian.\nUsing the Abbot Grant, A-RISE will fund conferences and host events that facilitate STEM research, as well as pay for publicity and entry fees into outside competitions and events.\nMarler said that A-RISE is currently undergoing the process of selecting a seven-seat Board of Directors and several committee leaders. \n“Some students simply have never heard of anything like [A-RISE]. A-RISE seeks to make the entire process of STEM-based projects more accessible to all PA students and we hope to provide engagement with the world of science that transcends the classroom,” she said.\nStudents with interests in STEM fields have been well-receiving of the project. Varun Roy ’18, A-RISE’s Society Research and Mentorship Coordinator, believes that A-RISE gives him the opportunity to expose his ideas to a greater market. \n“A-RISE gives opportunity [for scientific research] to many students… where I can go and do actual commercial level research as a high schooler to bring forth new ideas to the whole community as the world. I wanted to help other people spread their own knowledge and their own wanting to spread the findings of their research to the world,” said Roy.\nThe society looks to compete in a number of competitions this year including the Toshiba ExploraVision, TSA TEAMS, and Lemelson-MIT InvenTeams. \n“There’s always been a large wanting for people at Andover who are interested in STEM to spread STEM around campus. [The project’s purpose] is to educate the campus about STEM… and to compete in competitions… Ideally, the work at the competitions should further the project’s goals and provide strong results,” said Nick Masri ’18, a participant of A-RISE. \nMarler said that A-RISE plans to bring a STEM conference to campus this Spring, allowing for the Andover community to hear from experts in the Scientific fields and compete in several competitions.\n“As a new organization this year, we are looking to put on an interscholastic science conference in May, reach out to alumni and professionals to create mentorship and networking opportunities for students, and tentatively participate in several science and engineering competitions,” said Marler. \nPeter Frank, Instructor in Chemistry, had been looking to form a group like A-RISE for a while, and when Marler approached him with the idea for the initiative, Frank assumed the role of Faculty Advisor.\n\n', 'Dec 9, 2016'), ('\nOn the three-hour bus ride back from a Hotchkiss debate competition last Sunday, Akhil Rajan ’17 was stunned to receive a text from a friend at the tournament bearing the news that he had won his advanced speaker division, qualifying him for the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. \nThe prestigious worldwide debate competition invites around 200 competitors to participate in speech and debate events that include parliamentary debate and impromptu speaking, and will be held in Sydney, Australia, this March. It is the highest level of secondary-school debate in the world.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Rajan said, “In my freshman year, I remember one of the co-presidents of The Philomathean Society (Philo) had qualified for [World Championships] and everyone was super excited. What people say is that [the competition] represents the ideal form of debate where you have this exchange of ideas of people from such diverse backgrounds and origins.”\n“This has been a little bit of a debate dream for me; something that I’ve been really trying to work towards,” he continued.\nThrough the Debating Association of New England Independent Schools (Daneis), up to nine students from 30 schools in New England can qualify for World Championships by winning specific qualification debate competitions. At Hotchkiss, where the final qualifying debate was held, Rajan argued three resolutions with topics including universal health care and the spending of the U.S.’s military allies. In the final round, Rajan had to argue in favor of factory farming, a cause he is personally opposed to.\nHijoo Son, Instructor in History and Social Science and Faculty Advisor to Philo, said, “It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and tremendously honorable and incredibly proud moment for Andover to have a student represent our school at the World Championships… A competition like [World Championships] would provide an opportunity for Akhil to see how they would fare within a larger pool of students from all around the world. So it would be an exciting opportunity.”\nRajan started attending Philo meetings in the fall term of his Junior year at Andover because of his interest in politics and current affairs, he says. After serving as an Associate, Rajan has held the position of Vice President since his Upper spring. For four years, Rajan has been honing his skills by attending debates every weekend.\n“I think it is very important for my development as a person [who aspires] to be involved in government and policy-making at some point,” said Rajan. “The idea of thinking beyond the box that you’ve been born into, that you’ve seen around you, and that you’ve interacted with, I think is vitally important.”\nCarra Wu ’17, Co-President of Philo, has been Rajan’s partner in every debate since Junior Fall. The pair also won their division as advanced team in the Hotchkiss tournament. Because Rajan and Wu have worked together for so long, they have learned to play to each other’s strengths and cover for each other’s weaknesses.\n“Akhil and I have found ways of balancing each other out,” said Wu. “We’ve run the same arguments for four years, and we know how to debate each of the arguments, so there’s an incredibly fluid exchange of information that often doesn’t even require words.”\nDarius Lam ’17, Co-President of Philo, said, “Akhil is incredibly well-versed in foreign and domestic affairs. His grasp of past and current events is really incredible and he is able to recall examples for his arguments very quickly. This is very important for the parliamentary extemporaneous style we participate in, where debaters must create cases in only ten minutes.” \nAs Vice President, Rajan works with the other board members of Philo to train aspiring debaters and organize upcoming tournaments for the Daneis league.\nShyan Koul ’19 said, “He’s influenced pretty much every [lowerclassmen] in Philo and really made them enjoy debate. He’s made me appreciate it a lot more and just find a lot more fun in it.\xa0 A lot of people look up to him as not only a really good debater, but someone who can lead… [He’s] just an overall great guy, great debater, and I’m so happy that he got this.”\nRajan is currently looking for ways to financially support himself to attend the World Championships.\n“Unfortunately, the school was unable to provide any support for this and any future trips to Worlds, so Philo is trying to find alternate ways to send me and future debaters to the competition.

For some dorms, celebrating the holidays with festive decorations has become an ongoing tradition; other dorms hope to start a new tradition by creating a homey environment for students spending the holiday season away from their families.\nIna Megalli ’20, a resident of Eaton Cottage, agrees that decorations can be uplifting during the winter months.\n“I think they’re really nice. The lights help me find my way home in the darkness. They make me feel like Eaton Cottage is a lot more homey than it is without lights. It makes it look pretty and well done,” said Megalli.\nWith regard to how students from different backgrounds might perceive the decorations, Dea Barreto Lagesse ’18 said, “Most of the decorations revolve around a specific holiday. They can make it seem very isolating for people that don’t practice the religion.”\nRespecting the students who may not celebrate Christmas is highly important to house counselors. Shawn Fulford, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, and House Counselor of Eaton Cottage, says she decorates by season, not by holiday.\n“I decorate the dorm in every season. We always have a wreath. I mean from April through October the garden is blooming so when it’s November and December, the garden is just dead. I wanted to put something up that’s welcoming… I just want them to feel like they’re home,” said Fulford.\nAs the holidays quickly approach, dorms take on different approaches to the decorating process. Some are more unified. For instance, Debra Pickering, Chair in French and House Counselor of Clement House, typically hosts a holiday party the Sunday before break, complete with hot chocolate, carols, and cookies.\n“We typically have a little Christmas tree, decorated with baubles and tinsel, in the corner of the common room. I also give tinsel garlands to the girls to put up around the common room and in the entrance. Otherwise, it is up to the particular group of Clementines each year to decorate as much as they would like,” said Pickering in an email to The Phillipian.\nFrom year to year, students’ innovative contributions bring a unique twist to yearly traditions. Karissa Kang ’17, a three-year resident of Clement House, says her dorm is like family.\n“Last year, [a girl] in my dorm cut these beautiful snowflakes and hung them on the ceiling. Although they were a fire hazard, they were extremely beautiful. So this year I hope that we can have something equally as beautiful and hopefully will not be as dangerous,” said Kang.\n\nThe process of putting up decorations can also be a bonding experience for certain dorms. \nMax Ivakhno Bykova ’19, a current resident of Draper Cottage, said, “Decorating [the dorm] together would bring the people more because it’s a big task that everyone can collaborate on and give a bit to develop [the decorations].”\nOn the other hand, many dorms leave the job of decorating entirely to the students. \nKathryn McQuade, Instructor in English and house counselor at Nathan Hale, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “The house counselors in Nathan Hale don’t decorate the dorm for the holidays, but students often bring in their own decorations for their rooms, which of course we support.” \n“We want students to feel comfortable decorating for and celebrating the holidays that are significant to them personally, that bring a little bit of what they miss from home into their living spaces at Andover. And of course, we also want to honor the diversity of backgrounds and traditions that Hale students bring with them to the school,” continued McQuade.\nDecorations aren’t the only way to celebrate the holiday season. Gift giving events are very popular. In Eaton Cottage, a non-Christmas-affiliated ‘secret psych’ is planned for January where members leave each other little gifts. Another way that students celebrate is through an inclusive holiday party that celebrates all holidays and the beginning of winter break.\nValentina Boldurescu ’17\xa0 from Paul Revere Hall said, “[My friends and I] organize [a gift swap] because when you have to buy many presents for so many people…you’re trying to divide [your focus] amongst so many people.

This novel is one of three new books, alongside “I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual” by Luvvie Ajayi, and “Documenting and Assessing Learning in Informal and Media-Rich Environments” by Jay Lemke, which entered the shelves of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) this week. \nThe OWHL currently owns about 100,000 books. On a daily basis, new books are added to the collection in the OWHL, the Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) library, and the Addison Gallery of American Art. Many of these new books are donations made by the community. \nWhen accepting these donations, the librarians first check to see if they already own the book. Most are accepted to replace worn books or add to the library catalog. Collections of books that are specific to cultural diversity or American art are delivered to the CAMD library and the Addison library, respectively.\nApart from the donations, book requests are made by faculty members and students. If a student wishes to read a certain book or a member of the community recommends a book that would be helpful for the community, the librarians usually purchase these books. \n“We actually aggregate on a monthly basis a list of books that we order at the end of each month. We do that and then we also take individual requests that we get from the community as well. We try to support all the different studies on campus, the curriculum, but also try to get a really diverse selection of fiction, or graphic novels, or pleasure reading types,” said Elizabeth Tompkins, instructional librarian, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nOWHL is also part of an organization called the North of Boston Library Exchange (NOBLE), which includes many college and public libraries. Any student at Andover has access to not only the books in the OWHL, but also the books in any of the libraries that belong to NOBLE.\nMeanwhile, some students claimed that they did not have time to read books in the stacks for pleasure but instead read required readings for class.\n“I read [books] exclusively for class projects. I think, however, we don’t need more [pleasure] books. In terms of collections for History-300, 200, 100, we have plenty of those, but the more relevant science periodicals, I think we need those,” said Rawit Assamongkol ’18.\nGrace Hitchcock ’20 noted how recently published books were not readily available to her in the library. Hitchcock tried to check out a book that she wanted to read from the stacks, but was able to read the book four to five days later as the OWHL did not have a copy.\n“The book was published relatively recently and so this library didn’t have it, but another branch of the library did… It would have been more convenient if they did have the book here. One thing that could be a beneficial change is to have books that are published recently as opposed to having to wait for them,” said Hitchcock.\n\n', 'Nov 12, 2016'), ('\n“No, the short answer is no,” said Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, when asked whether she felt women writers are given enough credit for their accomplishments at the Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. Paige Roberts, Director of Archives and Special Collections, agreed, and hoped to further the highlighting of women’s accomplishments at the event. \nThe Brace Center worked closely with Roberts to organize a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon focused on creating and adding to Wikipedia entries on Abbot Academy (AA) writer alumni, highlighting the accomplishments of these female writers. The event will be one of a series of collaborations between the Archives and the Brace Center.\nMany AA alumnae authors were featured, including Anna Laurens Dawes AA ’71 and Edith Kathleen Jones AA ’1889, whose articles will go live on Wikipedia this week.\n“My feeling is that women writers probably are not highlighted enough in the history of literature. So one purpose of the event is to kind of further that, but I think we are making progress. Every little bit helps, the tie to school history is kind of cool too,” said Roberts.\nDuring the three-hour session, students created Wikipedia pages for alumni with the help of Techmaster Tony Tan ’17, using resources like the book “A Singular School,” written by Susan Lloyd an Abbot history instructor in the 1960s. \nTechmasters, AA alumnae, and students all participated in this event, held this past Sunday in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), quickly filling up the McLean Gallery before it had even begun. \nVidal, whose personal favorite AA writer alum is Julia Alvarez AA ’67, hopes that the event connects students with the stories of alumni past and present.\n“There are a variety of different goals [of the event], one of which is of course to increase visibility of Abbot writers through the very public medium of Wikipedia and to help the world know about the legacy of these writers. To connect alums and students so that they have an opportunity through this meaningful interaction to hear each other’s stories,” said Vidal.\nStudents who attended the event also shared similar visions of the event’s impact. Nell Fitts ’18 believes inequalities within the gender binary contribute to the writer alumni’s lack of representation on Wikipedia.\nFitts said “The Edit-a-thon is important because [it allows] for a great visibility of important historical figures, they don’t get as much recognition as they deserve, especially Abbot women… They haven’t had Wikipedia pages before now because we generally don’t care about the successes of women, [and] as a society they have been underrepresented. That’s just our past, and we are trying to amend that.”\nJason Reynolds ’18 edited an article on writer and newspaper columnist Anna Laurens Dawes.\n“[The Edit-a-thon] reveals how women are just as important in the world of literature as men… The women didn’t have Wikipedia pages before now because they were not respected writers of their time,” said Reynolds.\nTan, a Wikipedia advocate who has edited more than 3,700 articles, thinks that the writers’ absence on Wikipedia is a result of a majority male editorial group which does not know about the authors or have enough sources to create articles about them.\n“No one’s paid and everyone is doing their best. The goal of this project is to accumulate to something large so everyone is working together to get closer to that goal,” said Tan.\nRoberts agrees that Wikipedia is an important source of information for students and our society at large, which is why AA alumni representation on the site is so important.\n“I would love to have students to get to… have a little familiarity and comfort with Wikipedia as a creator through creating something with Wikipedia partly because in the real world after graduation this is the sort of thing that people do. You don’t actually always write research papers. It’s a great extra skill to have,” said Roberts.\n“It’s important for us to add quality information to Wikipedia partly because it’s the primary thing that comes up when someone is searching Google. If we can get Andover and [AA] information in there, that’s great,” she continued.\n\n', 'Nov 12, 2016'), ('\nWhen Chloe Kim, a senior at Milton, had an idea for a new publication, she reached out to Abdelaziz Bahnasy ’17 through a mutual friend. Soon, students all over New England joined in to make Kim’s publication a reality. Working collectively, the students created “The Tavern,” a weekly platform for high school students to write or publish artwork on any subject of their choosing.\nAccording to its Facebook page, “The Tavern” strives to create a community where students can record and express their thoughts by sharing their ideas with an audience outside their respective schools. With its motto, “A Thoughtpaper, Not a Newspaper,” “The Tavern” publishes a variety of works, from commentary to poetry and photography.\n“After thinking about our specific goal as a paper, we realized we weren’t interested in reporting news; our goal is to provide a platform for students from different institutions to engage in thoughtful dialogue and civil discourse,” wrote Kim in an email to The Phillipian.\n“The Tavern is unique, first of all, because it’s a collaboration between ten independent boarding schools in Massachusetts. Beyond that though, this is the one paper that’s totally commentary and uncensored in any kind of way. It does not have to fit any kind of agenda.” said Bahnasy.\nAs a member of the nine-person editorial board of “The Tavern”, Bahnasy serves as the Editor for Andover. Other members come from nearby prep schools including the Brooks, Milton, Governor’s, Tabor, Groton, Northfield Mount Hermon, St. Mark’s, and Concord. Each school maintains a panel of ten members and an editor.\n“The ten specific schools were not chosen out of exclusivity, but out of practicality. The list of schools on the masthead of ‘The Tavern’ may very well change or expand in coming years, but as of now, we’re trying to see if even this group of ten can be maintained,” wrote Kim.\nAlthough “The Tavern” is a recent creation, both Kim and Bahnasy have many ideas for the future of the publication. Kim hopes to someday publish a hardcopy issue, and Bahnasy hopes to give students more opportunity to write. Currently, each issue features a “ten-thoughts” article made up of a single weekly submission from each school. The article seeks to address a guiding theme or question. \xa0\n“If we could end up allowing every school to have submissions from students more frequently, that would serve the purpose a little bit better and that’s where I want to go with it,” said Bahnasy.\nKim, who was born in Seoul and raised in Minneapolis, loves to read and write poetry and fiction. The idea for “The Tavern” came to her in late-August after spending time with friends over the summer. \n“I wished there could be some way for me to continue being a part of their lives while still living mine. It just crossed my mind that it would be cool to have a newspaper uniting high schoolers across the country. I feel like it’s a natural tendency for schools to spotlight their focus on athletics more so than on the arts, and I hope ‘The Tavern’ can help in the effort to balance the scales,” wrote Kim.\nCurrently, ‘The Tavern’ has published two complete issues, both of which can be viewed on its website: “the-tavern.net.”\n\n', 'Nov 12, 2016'), ('\nMelania Trump, President-elect Donald Trump’s third wife, is a former supermodel who came to the U.S. in the mid-1990s. As the second non-American born First Lady in the country’s history and the first to pose nude prior to arriving at the White House, she faces challenges that many First Ladies have not.\nEmma Staffaroni, Instructor in English and an advisor to Women’s Forum on campus, said that First Ladies have been known for taking on a reserved, feminine role that helps gather more female supporters in the candidate’s campaign.\n“Women are kind of emblems of morality. They are supposed to represent family values, innocence, goodness, traditional motherliness… I think that in a way she elevates Trump. Frequently [and] historically, this is the sort of role that First Ladies can play,” she said.\nThough Ms. Trump was not an active spokesperson in President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign at first, more recently, she has spoken out. For instance, Ms. Trump said she would combat cyber-bullying in a campaign speech last Thursday in Pennsylvania.\nShu Sakamoto ’17 said in an interview with The Phillipian, “[Her focus on bullying is] not bad, that’s one of the things that [others] could actually relate to. She’s not saying she’s going to do something about foreign policies, but bullying is something that she does know about… I feel that’s good.”\nStaffaroni said, “[But] her husband is counteracting everything she says that could be good. The cyber-bullying issue is one that is really important. That’s an awesome focus for a First Lady campaign, but [her] husband is a part of the problem.”\nWomen in politics, Staffaroni said, are more judged for their physical appearances than men. She said that Ms. Trump has presented herself the way most wives of conservative men tend to present themselves – upper class, hyper-feminine, and professional. \nLucy Grossbard ’19, a Clinton supporter, believes that Ms. Trump sets an unrealistic standard for American women.\n“She meets the requirements of media’s ‘perfect woman,’ and she might set an example for young girls looking at her as our First Lady where we need to have thin waists, large breasts, and big butts [as if] we need to look like the perfect woman… She wouldn’t set the right goals for women,” said Grossbard.\nOther students are more concerned about the message Ms. Trump sends about the role and worth of women. \nJose Arnold ’19 said, “I think that she is not an unkind woman, but I think that to be okay and to stand by your husband when he makes sexist remarks just constantly, there’s inherently something wrong. She’s either scared or confused or a bad person, because misogyny is bad, and anyone who’s misogynist is inherently bad, and so I think she’s sending mixed messages to her children and children across America. She just kind of confuses me.”\nMisah Edwards ’20, a Clinton supporter, said, “I feel like Ms. Trump doesn’t even know what’s happening… I don’t feel like Ms. Trump does anything to help… There’s not really substance when it comes to her, she’s just kind of empty as a person, and I feel like she’s [Trump’s] trophy wife… I feel like that just brings worse expectations on women.”\nThe Phillipian reached out to four Trump supporters. All four declined the interview. \nEditor’s Note: This article was written for the Journalism elective\xa0– taught by Nina Scott, Instructor in English.\n\n', 'Nov 12, 2016'), ('\nInspired by the impact that TED talks have had on her life, Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19 successfully proposed a TEDxYouth Conference, which is to be hosted at Andover on January 14, 2017. The event will be comprised of around ten student talks exploring the theme, “What is our generation’s mission statement?”\nKanchinadam hopes that the conference will be an interactive opportunity that will help to spark discussion and provide a forum for student ideas on Andover’s campus.\n“Andover [is] the extreme opposite of my old school. When I came as a [Junior], I [felt like] I could do anything. And I thought, if I can do anything here, what’s the farthest possible thing that I could never have done that maybe I can do here. And TEDx was the first thing that came to mind just because it inspired me so much,” said Kanchinadam.\nKanchinadam said she has collaborated with the Tang Institute to plan the conference. She has also worked with a group of around 15 other students that are a part of Campus Connectors to pick the theme of the conference and choose speakers.\nTucker Drew ’17, a member of the Campus Connectors group, said, “Everyone on campus has several things that they’re really passionate about… They’re often passionate about it because they believe it’s important for our generation to focus on. This broad theme gives the opportunity to relate someone’s own work to the broader theme and increase connectivity between what I do and what you do on campus.”\nCaroline Nolan, Currie Family Director of the Tang Institute, said, “Tanvi brought the idea to us last spring, and we were just really excited to support a student-led effort to bring a TEDx Youth conference here… I think we’re really eager to host a platform where students feel as though they can contribute their important perspectives on key issues, both that resonate with our community, and with a global audience…I love the notion of a forum for ideas, I feel like this community thrives on that.”\nThe conference will include a series of keynotes and performances from several speakers. Kanchinadam is hoping to make the event very interactive to encourage discussions on the topic among students after the event.\nThe Oliver Wendell Holmes Library has also been, according to Kanchinadam, a vital supporter of her initiative. Michael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information, and Library Services, said he appreciates the emphasis on student perspective that the TEDxYouth conference will provide.\n“I for one am a huge fan of any kind of forum where students share their own work, their own ideas, to move the adults to the side for a minute and just present what they see. I think there’s a great sense of empowerment there. So before anybody even talks, I think we’ve already succeeded in creating a forum where students are asked to lead. I think that’s the greatest thing about it,” said Barker.\nA broad range of speakers will be chosen for the event, with the goal of making the conference as interdisciplinary as possible. According to Kanchinadam, the broad theme leaves room for interpretation, all with the hope that speakers will pick a topic that interests them personally. The speakers selected will then spend a term working with instructors to develop their ideas into five to 15 minute presentations.\nAnjalie Kini ’19 wants to use the TEDx conference to share her ideas about the importance of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic fields.\n“Giving a TEDx talk is a really good opportunity that is not something that a lot of people have the chance to do. Also, it’ll be really interesting to do the research and develop the presentation and speech and learn more about the topic that I’m doing and be able to share my ideas with other people,” said Kini.\nThe first and only previous TEDx conference at Andover was hosted in 2013. In the future, Kanchinadam wants to bring in speakers from surrounding schools and potentially dedicate one entire day in a school year to TEDx workshops.\n“I want it to be an annual thing, I really want it to continue after I graduate. At least [I hope that] by my senior year we’re going to have TEDx conferences for an entire day, where the entire campus is experiencing it. Instead of having one set of speakers, there would be different speakers at different times. So you would be running from one talk to another talk… In the end, I want it to have the Andover spirit,” said Kanchinadam.\nStudents interested in becoming speakers should submit a speaker proposal application by November 27, 2016. Student speakers will work with the Tang Institute and participate in a series of trainings on public speaking and other skills in preparation for the conference.\n\n', 'Nov 11, 2016'), ('\nWhen CNN projected that Donald Trump would win Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, at around 1:30 a.m., Carra Wu ’17 knew that it was over for Clinton, her preferred candidate. As recounted in an interview with The Phillipian, Wu was frantically refreshing “The New York Times” paths-to-the-presidency web application in her room. After losing the swing state, Wu realized Clinton’s best-case scenario was a tie.\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, Donald Trump, the businessman from New York, defeated Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, in the race for the white house.\n“Honestly, I still went to bed with a vestige of hope and woke up a couple times in the middle of the night, frantically checking my inbox. It was devastating when I finally woke up for real and found out Trump had won on my phone. I didn’t process it at first,” said Wu.\nAfter writing mental lists in her head of what she could have done to better support her candidate, Wu decided to focus on the present, and she reached out to Andover community members for support. Led by Wu, a handful of students who felt sincerely discouraged by the results of the election sat together silently on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall during school hours on Wednesday, in an attempt to unite in the face of a seemingly divided nation.\nT. Rynne\nThe group stood with Out of the Blue (OOTB), a student organization on campus that hosts and facilitates social justice forums, which invited disheartened students to wear all black as “a symbol of mourning for the destructive rhetoric that has been (and will continue to be) used by our next president,” according to an email OOTB sent to its club members.\n“I think one of the reasons why we’re wearing black and also staying silent and not playing music, all of that is in a note of solemnity. I don’t want it to be gimmicky, but there is something to be said that we are mourning the loss of this opportunity, the incredible decade’s work done by women and immigrants… We’re mourning all these things that we took to be quintessentially and unequivocally American,” said Wu.\nAccording to a survey conducted by The Phillipian, 73 percent of Andover students and 94 percent of faculty supported Clinton for president. Many members of the community were concerned by the divisive rhetoric Trump demonstrated throughout his campaign.\nIndy Sobol ’17, who was part of the group on the steps of Sam Phil, said, “People keep asking us if it’s a protest. There’s no political thing that we want to get out of this. It’s just that people are so lost and feel so betrayed, and we can come together and talk to each other and just start feeling like we’re not hated, and that we’re not completely alone.”\nLinda Griffith, Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion and Faculty Advisor to OOTB, said that she supports student-run demonstrations as a way to express dissent and gain acknowledgement from the public eye without suppressing opposing views.\n“I love that it came from the students… Now that we’re here, and the election is behind us, this allows those who are not [happy] to express themselves without necessarily stomping on someone else’s celebration. I always support those types of responses on campus, especially a high school. It is a subtle, quiet way, but obvious way, of bringing awareness and bringing solidarity,” said Griffith.\nEven as a Republican, Bryce Murphy ’18 was in anticipation of Clinton’s win. He believes the surprising outcome of the election reflects a division in the nation regarding different issues.\n“People have to understand that just because I support the Republican political party does not mean I support every policy that Donald Trump is trying to pass and everything that he says…I don’t condone what Donald Trump has said,” explained Murphy.\n“I look at my life and certain values stand out, and they are Republican. The Democrats want to raise taxes even further, and I live in Illinois, one of the most highly taxed place in America, so raising taxes would negatively affect my family,” he continued.\nThe administration made the last-minute decision to change what was intended to be separate class meetings to one All-School Meeting (ASM) the morning after the election results. This decision was made to assemble the Andover community and address the fear that some students felt.\nThe ASM featured addresses from Head of School John Palfrey; Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, who gave her speech in tears; and Griffith.\n“At Andover, we reject bigotry. We will not tolerate hateful, bigoted actions,” said Elliott in an emotional address to the Andover community. “In this space, today, we have folks who are feeling scared and unsafe… In the weeks and months ahead, reflect, think, and dream about how you can better serve your peers, your community, and your world. Dream about how you will confront the complicated problems that divide us today. I have deep faith in you, and I will celebrate you every step of the way.”\nPalfrey said, “This morning, as we wake up to a divided nation and a world of hurt and anger, I find I am devoted more than ever to the central cause that brought me to Andover: to help to make this residential school an example of a tolerant, loving, diverse, serious, hard-working, supportive, unbreakable community.”\nMurphy held a slightly different view towards the ASM. The Phillipian reached out to seven Trump supporters, and all but three declined the request for an interview.\n“Imagine if Clinton became president and there is a group of people wearing black, because Donald Trump was not elected. If Hillary Clinton won, I am sure there would be tons of people cheering and being happy about this, so I think that people just need to look at both sides and we need to understand each other and figure out how to move forward,” Murphy said.\nSophie Schwartsman ’18 described how it was incredibly biased for the administration to cancel regularly scheduled activities in light of the election.\n“I respect that point of view and support the message of unity, tolerance, and respect. What I do not support is a mandatory meeting where students are forced to listen to perspectives that alienate the limited portion of the student body who feels content with the results of the election… The reaction from this campus felt very judgmental and continued the complete intolerance for the conservative view and unwillingness to have a productive and educational conversation that created a silent majority willing to elect Donald Trump… As long as both sides are heard, I am confident that we can work towards a better future in which no one feels excluded from democracy, ” said Schwartzman.\nGriffith announced at ASM that there would be safe spaces available for students who needed to debrief the news of Trump’s presidency, including the Office of Community And Multicultural Development and the Brace Center for Gender Studies.\nJack Hjerpe ’17 said, “As a queer person, [Donald Trump] hinted at plans to repeal a lot of the legislation that protects queer citizens, which is a huge problem for me. I think that’s the biggest thing I’m concerned about: my right to marry whoever I choose, my right to be protected against discrimination when it comes to employment. Those are the two things that are being attacked, and are two things that are really important to my livelihood.”\nSensing a need for Andover students to reflect with one another on the results of the election and its implications, Hjerpe, Peter Rossano ’17, and Casey Yarborough ’17 met to plan a makeshift Andover Political Union (APU) meeting in the Freeman Room of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. At 6:15 p.m., they and many other students packed the room to share their raw reactions – some of which included tears and bursts of frustration.\nJulian Colvin ’19, an attendee of the meeting and a supporter of Trump, said, “I think Mr. Palfrey did a very good job in mentioning the paradox of tolerance. I think we will become a much more united campus as time goes on, as emotions settle, and when we recognize the peaceful transition of power that’s going on right now. President Obama has made me incredibly hopeful, Secretary Clinton has made me incredibly hopeful, and the reaction of our leaders has made me incredibly hopeful… incredibly respectful of the processes that we have for the peaceful transition of power.”\n\n', 'Nov 11, 2016'), ('\nNestor Payan can be found behind the stir-fry counter during lunch and dinner, sizzling meat and vegetables while chatting with students as they wait in line for their meals.\nOriginally from the Dominican Republic, Payan has worked at Andover since 2009 cooking for several food stations at Paresky Commons throughout his career. He wakes up at 6:30 a.m. every morning, and serves around 150 plates of stir-fry to members of the Andover community every day. The Phillipian’s interview with Payan was conducted in Spanish by Juan Pablo Ramos Barroso, Associate News Editor.\nPayan drives from his home in Lawrence to Andover for his 10:30 a.m. shift. His morning routine consists of taking a shower, drinking a coffee, and spending time with his mother prior to heading to work. Once he arrives to school, he prepares himself for the day ahead.\nT. Rynne\n“The first thing I do is change into my uniform, and next I check the menu for the current day, the day that follows, and what we are serving that night. After, since I arrive in the morning, I prepare all of the food that needs preparing for the day, and I prepare the food for the next day during the afternoon,” said Payan.\nPayan spends one half of his ten-hour shift cooking stir-fry for students and faculty alike, and the other half preparing ingredients for the meals that follow. His work day officially begins at 10:30 a.m., with a meeting for all Paresky staff that is followed by a break at 2:15 p.m. His shift ends at 7:00 p.m., and Payan says he often does not arrive home until 8:00 p.m.\n“The kitchen closes at 2:00 p.m., but we have a meeting at 2:15 p.m. about the production that we have for the entire week. Any additional information for any event that employees are required to attend is given at that time,” said Payan.\nThroughout his working hours, Payan and other Paresky employees can get lunch under the condition that there is someone at their assigned station and that they do not interfere with the faculty and students’ process of getting food themselves. Payan described the system in place for Commons’ workers meals, saying that there is an established set of rules at play. \n“One cannot eat while serving food or while being behind a line, seeing how [Paresky staff] has a [designated] time for that. Sometimes we break the rules if we are very thirsty, but normally we can’t eat nor drink behind the line in which food is being served. Also, if we grab food with the glove that we use to serve food, we have to make sure that we change it because we don’t want to mix different foods together,” said Payan. \nEven though Payan’s work hours are only from Monday to Friday, special occasions often arise that lead to extended work hours, whether it be on a regular weekday or for a specific event throughout the weekend. \n“I often have to prepare food for special events whenever the school tells me to, such as in festive days like Thanksgiving. If the event aligns with [Paresky staff’s] regular work hours, our food stations take priority over the event. This leads to someone being found that can cover the event instead,” said Payan. \n“Last Saturday, since it was Family Weekend, I had to come here and work around 11 hours preparing and serving food for the parents,” said Payan.\nApart from the special events, there have been instances in the past where Payan and his coworkers have had to spend the night in Paresky due to severe weather. According to Payan, Paresky is fully equipped with beds that are placed in designated spaces for the workers.\n“I had to spend the night on two occasions because of snowstorms last year. [Most of the Paresky staff] slept in the building. [My co-workers and I] had to spend the night, because the students and teachers need to get breakfast the next day and if we had left, we wouldn’t have been able to come back in the midst of a storm,” said Payan.\nEditor’s Note: Conversations with Nestor Payan were conducted in Spanish and were translated from Spanish to English by Juan Pablo Ramos Barroso, Associate News Editor for The Phillipian, vol.

She had been chosen as a student delegate to represent Massachusetts at the annual Global Youth Institute World Food Prize Conference in Des Moines, Iowa.\nBeginning on October 13, the three-day-long conference allowed over 400 students to connect with teachers, Nobel Prize laureates, and agronomists to discuss critical problems facing the world in the agriculture and food safety industry.\nPinga said, “The Global Youth Institute runs parallel to the World Food Prize, which is a ceremony for real agronomists and scientists in the ‘food realm.’ The World Food Prize is the Noble Peace Prize for agriculture, so it allows students to go to this conference and experience what it is like to deal with these [agricultural] issues and interact with all these famous people in this line of business.”\nTo apply, high-school students from around the world were asked to write a research paper about a food security issue of their choice with the help of a teacher or mentor. Pinga chose to write her paper on the dangers of aflatoxins, cancer-causing molds, that contaminate food in Malawi, which earned her a certificate of participation.\nPinga said, “In the spring of my freshman year, I was researching for some programs or jobs to do over the summer, and I managed to stumble upon the Global Youth Institute. I was really interested in the Biology course I was taking and thought it would be a great opportunity to learn more about food insecurity that plagues the world around us.”\nIn addition to getting her paper signed by the former president of Malawi, Joyce Banda, while at the conference, Pinga also attended a keynote speech by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, met the Minister of Agriculture in Liberia, and conversed with C.E.O.s from the agriculture and farming industries.\n“I definitely became more aware of the food insecurity issue in the world. I learned that it’s really an oppressing issue. A lot of people are affected by it, and there’s a lot in the world that we don’t know,” said Pinga.\nAttendees were also able to participate in an Oxfam Hunger Banquet. At the banquet, each diner receives a different meal, determined randomly by raffle to represent the way in which people are born into different socioeconomic privilege. Pinga hopes to bring some of her experiences back to Andover by possibly hosting a similar event on campus. The event would raise funds to help support Oxfam’s mission to alleviate global poverty.\n“I would just like to raise awareness of the severity of food insecurity in the world. Here at Andover, it’s sometimes tough to look outside and realize our most basic privileges. It was surprising to me how much people were involved in it and so I’m taking those perspectives and relating them to my experiences now. I actually want to pursue this line of work now after this conference. It was very inspiring and overall amazing,” said Pinga.\nPinga said she was more thankful for the opportunity to attend the conference.\n“I would definitely encourage other students to participate in this conference. It was such an amazing experience, and [it] completely transformed the way I think and see the world. It sort of exposes you to the problems that they’re trying to fix. The prize was going to the conference and being able to experience it. It was an honor to be there and an honor to represent Massachusetts,” said Pinga.\n\n', 'Nov 4, 2016'), ('\nWhen Dr. Gregory Cartin was in high school, he wasn’t aware of the benefits of meditation and mindfulness in training for sports, and his athletic performance suffered as a result, according to Cartin. Now, as a professional sports psychologist, he hopes to help adolescents learn from his mistakes.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Cartin said, “I was an athlete all my life and realized in high school that there was more than just physical skill that allowed athletes to succeed, and at competitions sometimes I didn’t perform as well as I thought I could or didn’t practice.”\nThis past Tuesday, teachers, coaches, students, and athletes gathered in the Underwood Room to watch Cartin’s presentation on sports psychology and mindfulness. Cartin has worked in the field of sports psychology for over 13 years, and he has been a private practitioner at GC3 Performance Consulting for five years. \nCartin spoke about the effect mindfulness can have on athletic and academic performance and aimed to spread his knowledge to coaches, student athletes, and teachers. He believes that even the highest level athletes can suffer from nerves or emotional distress that can hamper athletic performance.\n“Nobody is immune from anxiety, fear, anger. We all share that in common. This is something most student athletes should know, everyone is going through the mental challenges as well,” said Cartin in his presentation.\nLani Silversides, Head Coach of Andover Girls Basketball, brought Cartin to campus as part of the Tang Institute class she leads on sports psychology. \n“Part of my work with the Tang Institute is running a sports psychology class for student athletes, and it is in its pilot year. It is Tuesdays nights, one hour a week where I am meeting with Senior student athletes that opted into it. Each week we talk about the mental skills that can help student athletes in their performance,” said Silversides.\n“One of our topics was mindfulness and sports, and I met Dr. Cartin at Boston University last year through sports psychology course. I was taking in graduate school there and he does a lot of his practice with mindfulness training with his athletes, so we wanted to bring him to campus as another voice to share some of his experiences with elite athletes and performance,” Silversides continued.\nCartin suggested that dissatisfaction with the quality of athletic performance can actually help athletes to improve their skill, as long as they learn to move past emotional blockades by using meditation to learn and grow as players.\n“It is okay to be uncomfortable. Human beings seek comfort, so we are working against ourselves, our evolution, when we are performing we are always seeking to control the environment. In reality, we cannot do that,” said Cartin.\n“The best most simple practice, is an insight meditation practice, where what you’re doing is sitting quietly and paying close attention to when your mind wanders and you use your breath as an anchor,” he continued.\nStudents walked away with knowledge of how to apply mindfulness to athletic performances.\n“When we were talking about nerves and recognizing your nerves and realizing they are okay, and using them to your advantage. I guess I did find it surprising. I have always tried to get rid of my jitters and my pre-game nerves, but to hear that it is okay to have nerves, it helps you be the best you can be,” said Cassie Chin ’17, co-captain of Andover Girls Soccer.\nLaura Bilal ’17, a member of Andover Girls Basketball and Girls Lacrosse said, “He was very insightful, and I think that his coming here and talking to athletes at high school level is incredible and I think that if we can widespread this around campus it can be super beneficial to students so I think it is incredible.”\nHolden Ringer ’17 a member of Boys Cross Country as well as Boys Track & Field, believes he already prepares mentally for his races subconsciously, in lieu of a traditional meditation method.\n“I already feel like I have a pretty positive outlook going; I don’t feel like I’m doubting myself. Some of the stuff he brought up, I feel like I already do a pretty good job of doing. Just something little I do, I do it subconsciously. I prepare for my race and it’s just natural. There’s not a mindfulness or meditation thing that can help with that. I just pray before my race, say thankful things, and make sure I’m prepared,” said Ringer.\nCartin, who completed his Masters in Counseling Psychology from Boston University, said the best way to practice mindfulness is through meditation. Although students at Andover may say that it is difficult to find time to meditate with such busy schedules, Cartin believes meditation is an important and convenient part of daily life.\n“Meditation is not for relaxation, it is to sharpen your focus and awareness. The best time to meditate is when you wake up,” said Cartin in his presentation.\n“Setting aside 10-15 minutes a day I think is a doable amount of time and that students should try to commit to,” said Cartin in an interview with The Phillipian.\nEditor’s Note: Laura Bilal and Cassie Chin are Sports Editors for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2016'), ('\nWhen Julia Lane ’17 first began her research into the abuse of disabled women, she was stunned by horrific stories from survivors of such abuse. She read the story of a physically disabled woman named Traci, who was beaten by her husband but believed she had no choice but to stay with him, as she thought she could not support herself on her own. \n Over the course of her research into the abuse of disabled women, Julia Lane ’17 encountered the story of a physically disabled woman named Traci, who was beaten by her husband but believed she had no choice but to stay with him, as she thought she could not support herself on her own.\nTroubled by the prevalence of stories like Traci’s, as well as the lack of conversation on campus surrounding disability, Lane delivered her Brace Student Fellow Presentation entitled “Anatomy, Autonomy, and Abuse: An Analysis of the Abuse of Physically Disabled Women” to raise awareness of disabled women’s rights and abuse.\nLane aimed to outline the correlation between power imbalances and gender-based abuse of women with physical disabilities, as well as offer a solution to combat the abuse of physically disabled women.\n“Disability just seems to be something that no one really acknowledges, maybe because it is rather infrequent, especially on a campus like this. I was just fascinated by how something that is so defining in the lives of the people with disabilities can just be ignored by everyone,” said Lane in an interview with The Phillipian.\nDuring her presentation, Lane focused specifically on physical and sexual abuse of women with physical disabilities, while highlighting the intersections between disabilities and abuse. \nReferencing a diagram called the “Power and Control Wheel,” depicting the relations between power and control with physical and sexual abuse, Lane focused her presentation on several factors that perpetuate the cycle of abuse for physically disabled women: isolation, dependence, and the medical model of disability, which shows a medical process of dehumanization. These factors contribute to a lack of agency for physically disabled women.\n“Physically disabled women experience longer terms of abuse because they are so profoundly disempowered by medical, social, and political systems, and this disempowerment enhances the control that male abusers wield over their victims, preventing physically disabled women from reporting or escaping abuse,” said Lane in her presentation.\n“These women do not have the authority to make decisions about their lives and their bodies,” she continued. \nAdditionally, Lane explained the systemic challenges those with disabilities face, such as a lack of disability-accessible resources, inadequate training for people who work with abuse survivors, and insufficient sexual education for many people with disabilities. To conclude her presentation, Lane showed how participation can work to combat these issues.\n“[Participation] is largely the antithesis of disempowerment. Participation combats the harmful effects of the medical model of disability, because patients can be encouraged to participate actively in decisions of their health, their treatment, and their bodies, actually empowering them when they step into the doctor’s office,” said Lane in her presentation.\nDuring her research, Lane worked closely with her faculty advisor, Donald Slater, Instructor in History and Social Sciences, as well as Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, who guided her through the process of researching, drafting, and writing her paper and presentation.\n“I was in [Slater’s] class for History 300, and I could tell that he had so much insight into the research process because he had done a lot of research himself. I knew he would be an amazing resource, and I got along really well with him, so I was happy to work with him,” said Lane.\nVidal said “There were so many aspects of this whole project that were incredibly successful. I think she did a phenomenal job of unpacking [the topic]; that level of critical thinking at this level of complexity and being able to understand it, and to write about it eloquently and logically and persuasively – we don’t see much of that in high school, we really don’t, not even in Andover. So that was an aspect that made it truly special.”\nLane’s presentation was met with enthusiastic responses from an audience consisting of students, faculty, and former alumni. \n“I was just remembering sitting in the dorm with her last spring when she was first pitching this idea, and I really did not understand just how much of an issue it was, and it was just something that I had never really considered before. It’s clearly a very pervasive issue, so I guess I just took away just how widespread it actually is,” said Laurel Wain ’17.\n“I found that the presentation represented people that aren’t always represented, and I think it is important to remember this group of people, disabled people, and how they aren’t necessarily acknowledged in our society, especially in a community like Andover,” said Abigail Taylor ’20.\nLane hopes that her presentation and research will spark students’ interest in the abuse of power and control targeting women with physical disabilities. \n“I wanted to bring this to light and to share this experience with other people on campus, and I really hope that it actually inspired some people to look into this topic,” said Lane in an interview with The Phillipian. \nEditor’s Note: Julia Lane is President and Editor in Chief of The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2016'), ('\nWith tears in her eyes, Auguste White ’17 beamed with pride as she showed the audience a photo of the young boy she helped to deliver this summer while interning in Tanzania. As the recipient of the Class of 2017 Lorant Fellowship, White relayed her experiences working in a small Tanzanian hospital over the summer during All School Meeting (ASM) last Wednesday.\nThe Lorant Fellowship, granted annually to one member of the Upper class, allows a student to travel to another country to pursue a topic of their choice over the summer. This past year, White was awarded the Fellowship, with Rosie Poku ’17 and Jayshawn Fuller ’17 as the two other finalists selected from a crop of nominees.\nWhite said during her presentation, “I chose Tanzania because it has a high infant mortality rate, child marriage, and [female genital mutilation] rates. [The country] has also undergone serious political reform to prevent gender based health issues and discrimination. I wanted to explore my love of adorable babies, science, medicine, and feminism. The fellowship allowed me to see my passions blossom, and to develop inter-cultural connections and competency. It allowed me to see real life applications of Andover’s constitution which charges every student to see beyond themselves.”\nDuring her four-week stay in Tanzania, White interned at St. Joseph’s Hospital where she was able to help assist doctors and observe surgical exams. In addition, she met with women entrepreneurs as well as Maasai warriors – a local nomadic group – and worked under the Network Against Female Genital Mutilation (Nafgem), an organization that rehabilitates and helps women who suffered from female genital mutilation and nonconsensual child marriages.\nWhile at the hospital, White developed a particular connection with a Yvonne, a young 17-year-old mother in the midst of labor. Being the same age, the two shared similar tastes in pop music and Yvonne discussed with White her favorite Biblical story, David and Goliath. When Yvonne’s delayed labor forced her to have an emergency cesarian section, White rushed to the young mother’s side to protect her from doctors about to perform the cesarean section, risking her volunteer position in the hospital and travel visa in the process. White got to Yvonne in time to deliver her baby, and she did not lose neither her position as an intern nor her VISA.\n“Being in Tanzania for such a long time, I became a bloodhound for hope. I could smell it from a mile away, it was unmistakable and overwhelming. Once I’ve caught the scent, nothing can stop me from hunting it down. I encountered so much hope in Tanzania, because my experience with the women, the nurses, the doctors, [the mother] and her baby all taught me how resilient hope is,” said White.\nWhite cited the experience as one of most important events of her life because the Lorant Fellowship allowed her to pursue her passion for medicine and feminist healthcare.\nWhite was nominated by members of the student body and faculty last fall and was selected from three candidates, out of a pool of 60 nominated Uppers, to be the recipient of the fellowship based on her proposal last winter.\n“It was the most important four weeks of my life, I can say with certainty. It changed me fundamentally, I think about it all the time. When I found out I was nominated for the Lorant Fellowship, it was fantastic and my heart exploded with joy. If you have a crazy idea, but people are willing to support you, run with it. If you feel like something might be misunderstood or it will be hard to present, if people are willing to offer you the support, then I think you should pursue it to its fullest extent,” said White in an interview with The Phillipian.\nLater on Wednesday, the Andover community received an email from the Lorant Fellowship Council for new nominations of current members of the Upper class. Dale Hurley, a member in the council and Instructor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, introduced the ASM by stressing the importance of learning both inside and outside of the classroom.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Hurley said, “We pick the student with the most earnest endeavor because they are sort of self-motivated and they do things on their own. We help them, but we don’t tell them what to do, it’s got to come from them. I think in a lot of ways, it’s easy for us because we pick the right people. The whole point is that you pick the person that’s really into what they do.”\nWhite’s hope-filled and positive message struck a chord with Marianne Bautista ’20 who said, “I was very inspired about [being able to reach out to help others]. Just seeing how young Auguste is and how she’s able to go to other countries and help other women give birth and give life into the world, I thought that was very inspiring.”\nMax Davis ’19 said, “I didn’t realize how common it was for girls to be married off at such a young age, and I also didn’t realize how common genital mutilation was… I didn’t realize how dire the situation was and I think Auguste really brought that into the light… We’re always so focused on things that affect our lives. This is something that largely doesn’t affect our lives, but is so extremely important.”\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nIn light of the upcoming 2016 presidential election, The Phillipian conducted an interview with Daniel B. Schwerin ’00, Director of Speechwriting for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Schwerin shared a wide variety of anecdotes, ranging from his experience as Editor in Chief of The Phillipian, to his involvement and perspective surrounding the Clinton campaign.\n\xa0\nWhat is it like to work in politics now, and how do you tie that back to your time at Andover?\nI’ll tell you that one of my first experience in politics was [when] I was class of 2000, and we covered George W Bush’s run for president because he was an alum. Every week, we had a regular feature ‘Bush Watch.’ On the night of New Hampshire primary, so probably February of 2000, the two news editors and I borrowed a faculty advisor’s car and drove to Manchester and covered the primary night. We managed to get to see Bush, Gore, and Bradley.\nI didn’t expect to go on to politics, [and I hadn’t] really thought of being a journalist or a lawyer, but I graduated from college during the 2004 presidential election, and I took a year off… I got an internship on the hill with Hillary Clinton, who was my home senator, because I lived in upstate New York.\nI went to Virginia and worked for a little-known governor named Tim Kaine… Then Hillary’s office told me “You were a good intern. We have an opening for Junior staffer would you like to come interview for it?” So I did, and they hired me. And that was late 2005, and I have never left, so I’ve been there for over ten years, which is very unusual in politics because most people move around a lot. But she kept giving me new opportunities, so it stayed interesting.\nHow does the media influence the way you write speeches for Secretary Clinton?\nTwitter has really changed [speechwriting]. Now people are live-tweeting your speech [so] you have to both think about what’s a memorable line that is going to get tweeted. People have really developed a sense of knowing what sounds political, and they don’t like it. You have to write something that’s snappy and memorable enough to get tweeted and passed around, and posted on Facebook, but something that just doesn’t sound like politicians.\nIt’s tricky, and I think every speechwriter whose working now is watching Twitter as the speech is delivered, how people are receiving it in real time. Not that long ago, you wrote a speech and you’d tune in that night on the news or read in the next day in the paper — what did people think of it? But now I know, as it’s being delivered, which lines are working and which ones aren’t. And if I’ve gotten something right or I’ve gotten something wrong, I can tell right away.\nCan you explain the process of speech writing? Do you write your speeches alone, and then show them to Secretary Clinton or is it more collaborative from the beginning? \nIt’s a great [and] very collaborative team. The candidate has been doing this for a long time and usually has a very clear sense of what she wants to say about something. We will go back and forth on drafts and she’ll send me back to the drawing board. She’ll say “I want more of this and less of that.” Occasionally, [Clinton’s] husband will call me up in the middle of the night… One of the things that I learned at The Phillipian [was] to be the kind of writer where you don’t feel too much pride of authorship. You’re always going to be edited.\nOne of the nice things about having been with the same person for more than a decade is that we know each other really well. I’ve gotten to know not just her voice, which I think is sort of an overrated concept in speech writing, but worldview is important — how your boss thinks about a problem, what’s going to interest her, what’s going to make her laugh, what’s going to make her angry or inspired, and how would she go about solving a problem. If you can figure those things out, then the words will come.\nThe first bit of writing of mine that Hillary ever read, and liked, was a write-up of the office softball game in the Senate. And it was like, after work, we’d play. And I wasn’t very good at softball, but I’d write up a funny report from the game, and we’d circulate it among the staff. And then she got her hands on it, and she was like, ‘Who wrote this? This is good!’ and I was just an assistant in the office. And no one ever asked me to do that. I just did it. And that’s the thing — you have to find every opportunity to just write and keep doing it.\nDo you have any advice for any students hoping to go into a similar profession?\nI would say that there’s no substitute for just getting involved. You can volunteer on a local campaign — they tend to be great. You can get a lot of responsibility fast. You can do internships, when you’re in college, with a congressman or a senator or a local representative. Smaller is sometimes better because you’re going to get to know the candidate or the elected official more directly and maybe have more responsibility, but bigger is good, too.\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nStanding in a fighting stance and being prepped for combat situations, a group of 20 eager students participated in the first self-defense lesson held at Andover this past Sunday. The class was held by two instructors from the Combat Objective Battle Ready Applications (C.O.B.R.A.) organization on Sunday afternoon. The instructors, Chris Fazzio and his assistant Marissa Haddid, placed an emphasis on reality-based attack scenario training and on both the mental and physical aspects of self-defense.\n“It’s a crazy world, and there’s just so much bad stuff. In [the town of ] Andover, you don’t see a lot. At Phillips [Academy], you’re probably even more isolated. But when [bad stuff ] happens, it’s terrible. If you can take a 45 minute class that protects you, and makes sure that [an attack] never happens to you, then [the class is] a good thing,” said Fazzio.\nIn the class, students learned how to adapt a fighting stance and to break free from an attacker’s grip by twisting and pulling away. They received advice about fighting and practiced ways to hold off against an attacker.\n“I learned the basics of physically defending yourself from getting hurt, and how to fight back with the minimal risk of hurting yourself, but the main thing that I learned is about being a soft target and a hard target,” said Evelyn Wu ’18.\nA soft target was described by Fazzio as a person that an attacker would aim for usually determined by age, gender, or background. Fazzio acknowledged that these characteristics can often not be changed, so emphasized the importance of being able to hold off attackers and increase protection.\n“We didn’t get to do a whole lot, but from [what] we did do, I feel more confident in myself, which is very important because that confidence will make [me] less of a soft target,” said Kamsi Oramasionwu ’19.\n“I think that we have to realize that it is a very possible situation that we can find ourselves in, and it’s best to be prepared,” explained Emily Ortiz ’19.\nMcKenna Montenegro, Administrative Assistant and Wellness Programing Coordinator, took initiative by inviting C.O.B.R.A. to host the class after students expressed an interest in safety and self-defense.\n“I don’t think your gender or your background should make you fearful. I think you should just gain the skills to have that level of confidence to interact with your community and not be afraid,” said Montenegro.\nThe class provided a safe area to learn about fighting with a minimal risk of injury. Students would pair up and reenact a scene, in which one group of students would display aggression, and the others would defend themselves. Sydney Mercado ’19 said, “I feel a lot more confident and secure about defending myself. It’s reassuring to know that I can fight back if the need ever arises.”\nThis lesson is a part an ongoing Weekend Wellness series, which consist of PSPA-funded (Parents of Students of Phillips Academy) events that occur every Sunday in the Sykes Wellness Center. Zumba classes, yoga, and mindfulness activities are also hosted.\n“We were just trying to add in a new option to increase the variety of this program, so we decided to bring in self-defense. We think it’s an essential skill that everyone should have a chance to practice,” said Montenegro.\n“We need 20 students to make up each class, which is limited, but it’s a commitment for the students too. It looks like there’s good interest, which is really encouraging to me,” she continued.\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nIn 1942, nine-year-old Sam Mihara and his family were given a week to pack up all their belongings before departing their hometown of San Francisco. Upon the executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mihara’s family was relocated to Heart Mountain, Wyo., one of the ten Japanese internment camps during World War II, where they lived in one 400-square foot room in a barrack.\nMihara was one of 120,000 Americans with Japanese ancestry detained in relocation camps. In his presentation, he shared his perspective on the racial discrimination, intolerance, and injustice towards Japanese people of his era.\n“I am not going to hide history,” said Mihara. “My purpose [is] to reveal things that you won’t read [about] and you won’t hear because they are factual and they had a great impact on a lot of us,” Mihara continued.\nNow a member of The Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation, a museum founded at the site of the internment camp, Mihara visited campus last Friday to inform students about the history behind internment camps in America. His presentation entitled “All That We Could Carry” detailed the plight of Japanese-Americans in internment camps, focusing on his personal experiences in his own internment camp of Heart Mountain.\nThe presentation was arranged by the Department of History and Social Science, the Community and Multicultural Development Office, and the Tang Institute, with the support of the Lana Lobell Lectureship Fund.\n“I retired as a rocket scientist from the Boeing Company and I enjoyed my career – and about five years ago, I had a telephone call from the prison camp because they were receiving requests from many groups asking for somebody who was in the camp who can talk about the experience – they called me and said, ‘You were in the camp, can you talk about what happened?’ So I said yes, I’d be happy to talk, and that’s how it began,” said Mihara.\n“My first group was a group of government lawyers who wanted to hear what happened. They were too young and one reason they came to me is, there aren’t too many of us left because the people during World War II, they’re gone. Right now if they’re living, they’re in their eighties and nineties now because of the age – so they were looking for someone who was relatively healthy and can talk and move around the country – And I’ve been very, very busy all over the country giving talks,” Mihara continued.\nGrowing up in San Francisco, Mihara witnessed anti-Japanese sentiments firsthand from viewing signs and propaganda in his neighborhood.\n“[A] sign was made by a big advertising company in California [which] said, ‘Buy, Buy, Japs, Good-Bye’– [and] put on a corner one block from my house. Imagine if a similar sign went up one block from your house, before the order came out. That’s the nature of the degree of the problem that we had at that time,” Mihara described.\nAccording to Mihara, once the official decree calling for Japanese-American internment was released, families had to abide by strict regulations, including an 8:00 p.m. curfew and were only permitted to travel on designated streets and boundaries. The government then registered families to organize their departure to relocation camps in California, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas.\nMihara highlighted that the conditions at the internment camps were equivalent to those of prisons, presenting a picture of a sign mounted atop a barbed wire fence.\n“The sign tells people inside ‘Do not cross. If you cross this boundary, you can get shot and killed.’ That is the definition of a prison. If you feel you’re going to get hurt, it doesn’t have to look like Alcatraz or Leavenworth. If you feel that you’re going to get hurt by crossing a certain boundary, that’s the definition of being imprisoned. And that’s the condition we had at the camps,” said Mihara.\nThe speaker also pointed out that Japanese occupants suffered from the lack of advanced medical facilities, education, and proper homes. In particular, he described how his father and grandfather received improper treatment due to the absence of a medical expert, which ultimately led to their blindness and death, respectively.\nAnother emphasis of Mihara’s presentation was the impact that photography had on shaping the public sentiment of the internment camps. The speaker discussed the works of two photographers, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, who utilized the camera to achieve drastically different effects.\nWhile Dorothea Lange’s Smithsonian exhibit, documenting the lives of Japanese-Americans at Manzanar, prompted an official apology from the United States government, Mihara argued that Ansel Adams’ pictures, which depicted happy scenes of domestic life in the internment camps, had adverse effects.\n“Why would they be smiling? My rationale here is that these people were asked to smile. That’s an indication of the kind of photography that Ansel Adams took. He never took a single picture of a barbed wire fence, a guard tower,” said Mihara during the presentation.\n“My conclusion, and this is my opinion, is that he was paid to help the government look like they were being humane. That’s the power of a camera, that Dorothea Lange had [used properly] and [Adams] misused,” Mihara continued.\nAuguste White ’17, an audience member, was struck by Mihara’s candid and intimate explanation of the human rights violations that occurred during the Japanese internment.\n“I think he really re-enforced the humanity of the individuals who were there, and [it] was really cool to hear him talking about his experience candidly. I think he did a really compelling job of presenting the facts and having the audience realize [that] it wasn’t a matter of partisanship or what your political beliefs are, it was just simply a crime against humanity,” White said.\nChristina Cho ’19 stated how the presentation changed her view on photography, and Ansel Adams, a photographer that she had respected even before the recent Addison Gallery exhibit.\n“One thing I took away from this presentation is that photography and art itself is very censored in ways that I hadn’t expected it to because before. Even before the Addison Gallery, I knew who Ansel Adams was, and I’d really respected him as a photographer, but now, learning about this new side of how…photographers like [Adams] tie into history…, [being]part of kind of a giant scheme of censorship and government respecting people, it makes me think how I respect certain people and certain artists,” said Cho in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nNatalie Yeh ’17 drinks one or two double-shot espressos from Paresky Commons in a day, usually visiting the espresso bar at the café in Lower Left. Although she started out drinking only a few cups a week, Yeh is now completely dependent on coffee, she explained to The Phillipian.\n“[If I ever quit drinking coffee,] I would have withdrawal symptoms and probably start shaking. I would probably be really tired… I have friends who, when they drink too much coffee, their hands start shaking,” said Yeh.\nToo much exposure to the addictive drug can lead to longterm negative effects on students’ health. Students’ over-consumption of coffee and other caffeinated products is of great concern to Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-Director of Wellness Education.\n“The biggest thing that I think is important to remember is moderation. There are potential harmful effects to having too much, but [in] moderation a cup of coffee a day every few days [is] not a huge deal, and we are unlikely to see untoward effects. Where I worry is what I talked about before those mega doses of caffeine that just aren’t good for anybody, let alone for teenagers,” said Patel.\nYeh, who first tried drinking coffee at age eight, admits that after coming to Andover, she began drinking caffeinated beverages religiously.\n“My dad was drinking coffee every morning and it smelled too good, so I had to take a sip. It tasted disgusting, and I hated it the first time… When I came to Andover, it was definitely just lack of sleep and I just needed it to wake me up in the morning and then it became a habit,” said Yeh.\nSophia Gilmour ’19 drinks five cups of coffee a day by her own estimate, a practice she began for social reasons when she was nine years old. At Andover, she frequents the espresso bar in the lower left dining hall.\n“[I started drinking] because my parents thought it was polite. That’s what you did in polite company: you had to drink either tea or coffee. I chose coffee,” said Gilmour.\nMargot Hutchins ’20 began drinking coffee this past summer to wake herself up in the mornings for early regattas. She admits to drinking more coffee while she is on campus to keep herself awake in the morning.\n“I did a lot of regattas this summer, so we would have to leave at six, so I would have to get there at five thirty roughly, and it would just be very difficult so we’d have to use some coffee to get me through… It wakes me up,” said Hutchins.\nRuide Wang ’18, on the other hand, does not drink coffee on a regular basis, but usually uses the beverage to help him stay up late for work.\n“For me I drink one or two cups per night and I do that twice a week. I don’t drink in the morning. I usually use coffee for night shifts and stuff… Before coming here I used to drink a lot and then I realized first of all coffee really messed up my schedule and although it makes me psyched during the night, during the day I felt really tired so I’m trying to limit it,” said Wang.\nWhile Patel does not want to try to limit students’ caffeine intake, she does think that moderation and the time of day you drink your coffee are important to how the drug affects teenage bodies. Patel also acknowledges that coffee consumption can be a social habit.\n“I think that there’s a social component to having a cup of coffee or going downtown. I think there are some who will drink it to try to stay awake… I think that we should not necessarily limit the amount provided but it’s very reasonable to limit the time of day. That goes for the students as well as the adults in our community in terms of preserving our sleep cycles. To make sure that we are limiting it to breakfast and lunch and not necessarily requiring it at dinner,” said Patel.\nPatel’s main worry is students’ caffeine intake affecting their heart, especially when coffee is combined with other energy drinks or powders. Caffeine in the form of a serving of coffee or tea is is not an issue on it’s own, but student experimentation and combinations can be deadly.\n“What we do know is that in the last several years with the onset of those energy drinks like Monster and Red Bull… that the incident of emergency room visits has gone up generally, not necessarily for Andover students, but generally for people who are actually feeling palpitations or feeling like their hearts pumping too fast or too hard and for those who don’t know that they have a pre-existing heart condition,” said Patel.\nAlthough it may be difficult to achieve, Patel urges students to get more sleep so they will not need to rely on the effects of caffeine to get them through the day. She hopes that the new 4×5 schedule will make this goal more achievable.\n“You just need to sleep more. I know that that is something that we all try to do and I don’t mean to trivialize the issue and sleep deprivation at all because I think that’s a serious issue. And it’s one that were taking up as adults in this community as well as we’re getting used to a new schedule and a new calendar and how to preserve normal sleep time,” said Patel.\n“Starting classes later, that’s actually on the table in terms of conversation for a new schedule and calendar and adhering to American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines and others who support starting classes at eight thirty or later and trying to think about reducing the number of class prep that are required the next day and actually limiting it to no more than three per day those are all on the schedule as we consider a new schedule and calendar,” she continued.\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nAn unusual sight greeted students as they walked towards Gelb Science Center last Friday morning. Glistening in the sun, a heap of plastic bags filled with tiny goldfish sat waiting for students to take. News quickly spread as students rushed over to see whether or not they could acquire a free pet of their own. The prank was rumored to be the responsibility of the secret society T.U.B., though the perpetrators have yet to be caught.\nPatricia Thompson ’19 was walking by the Gelb lawn when, she says, she witnessed the fish being set out.\n“I was walking out of my dorm around 7:00 a.m. and I saw three or four people – they looked like guys – running around in black hoodies and they were carrying this box. I saw them dump the box out in front of Gelb and in the box were these bags of goldfish. After they dumped the box out, they picked it up and sprinted away,” Thompson said.\nThroughout the day, students were seen carrying plastic bags filled with water and one or two goldfishes to their classes. Many are now kept as pets in dorms around campus, and the Biology Department put the remaining fish into its aquarium.\nLeon Holley, Chair of the Biology Department, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I was certainly surprised by it, and it created a lot of work for our lab technician, Ms. Poulin, as she tried to place all the new fish in our existing aquaria.”\nHolley continued, “Some students in the building at this time wanted fish for their rooms. Though well intended, students taking fish to their dorms without having fish bowls, food, etc., isn’t a recipe for survival for the fish. All things considered, it may have a been an effective prank for someone but it turned out to be a big deal for the biology department.”\nMakenna Marshall ’18 was worried that students on campus may not be properly equipped to care for the fish. According to Marshall’s research, the average goldfish requires at least 10 gallons of water to live comfortably, although the number could be as high as 20 gallons depending on the species.\n“I think the prank was horribly barbaric considering the type of fish they used for the prank is something we, as students, are not capable of taking care of well. The common misconception about goldfish is that they belong in small bowls… Students here cannot afford or should not have to worry about a 20 gallon tank, an air filter, and a water oxygenator. It’s just insane. I just feel like the reason that secret societies shouldn’t exist is because they should be able to be held accountable for things like this. But other than that, they don’t do any harm,” said Marshall.\n“I prefer that we don’t have secret societies and people do get held accountable when they do dumb things. But thus far, other secret societies haven’t harmed us at all,” said Marshall.\nVictoria Lopez ’20, who was headed towards her Biology class first period when she noticed the bags of fish lying outside, said, “Some of the bags had dead fish inside them and some of them were alive, and it was a very weird thing to wake up to. I still have my fish. They’re doing fine. A lot of fish actually died and some people have been mistreating their fish.”\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nThe Gender Inclusivity Task Force, a group of faculty members tasked with creating a proposal for all-gender housing on an administrative level, is working with students to implement an all-gender dorm on campus. The task force’s initiative is to accommodate the needs of Andover’s transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and genderqueer students. A formal plan for the implementation of an all-gender dorm will be presented Winter Term, according to Task Force members, who declined to be interviewed until the plan is officially executed.\nThe proposal was spearheaded last fall by Karissa Kang ’17, through her project as a 2015- 2016 Brace Center Student Fellow. Kang wrote and presented a plan for one or two dorms of medium size – 15 to 25 students – to be designated as all-gender dorms. In Kang’s plan, students would check off whether or not they wanted to be part of an all-gender dorm on the housing form.\n“I think the benefits are twofold. The first, and I think the most obvious benefit, is for students who don’t identify either as boys or girls to have a space where they can safely live and be themselves. The second important aspect I feel like is [that] anyone of any gender can benefit from living with and interacting with people of other genders – as it is, there is a lot of self-segregation on campus gender-wise,” said Kang in an interview with The Phillipian.\nKang says that all-gender dorms would give students a safe and comfortable place to live and interact with peers of all genders.\n“I know that sometimes women and men find the space to be safer when it’s just with other women or men, and I want to respect that – but I would love if society also changed so that we would find ourselves in a place where men and women, boys and girls, people of all genders could live together,” said Kang.\n“I think that it could be really beneficial for the community just to have a space where genders can mingle and realize they really aren’t so different,” she continued.\nA student focus group – comprised of Kang, Jack Hjerpe ’17, Bennett Sherr ’17, Anneke Sherry ’17, and Ana Morales ’18 – have worked alongside the faculty task force since last spring to develop the proposal for all-gender housing. Hjerpe agrees that the current housing system does not adequately accommodate students of all genders.\n“I think that right now the dorm housing system is fairly binary. I think that if we’re going to claim to be a gender-equitable campus, we can’t do that without having housing options that represent people’s gender properly,” said Hjerpe.\nKang encourages people with dissenting opinions to advocate for their beliefs, as some community members, said Kang, might have some qualms about male and female students living together in the same dorm.\n“I think the biggest reason that people seem to object is just the fact that having guys and girls living together can result in guys and girls hooking up, and that results in other things, and that can be bad,” said Hjerpe.\nMelanie Tlaseca-Verde ’19 said, “The only reason why it would maybe be a bad idea would be because people would take advantage of it, which honestly I doubt if there’s an extensive process with the house counselor. [But] I think it would be helpful for the gender-nonconforming people who feel uncomfortable choosing between a female and a male dorm. It should be implemented. I’m surprised that it has not already been.”\nIn addition to unease about all-gender dorms leading to increased sexual activity between students, some students have also expressed concern that the all-gender dorm might isolate transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer students and pressure students who have not come out of the closet.\nHjerpe said, “I think it would be made clear that the dorm is not only for people who don’t identify as cis male or cis female, because that could effectively be outing someone who doesn’t want to be outed.” “I think that you’d have to get parental permission,” said Hjerpe, “but in seeking parental permission, it would not be made explicitly clear, ‘I want to live here because I identify as non-binary or I identify as transgender,’ but ‘this is a certain kind of housing community that I would like to be a part of.’ ”\n“I think that you’d have to get parental permission,” said Hjerpe, “but in seeking parental permission, it would not be made explicitly clear, ‘I want to live here because I identify as non-binary or I identify as transgender,’ but ‘this is a certain kind of housing community that I would like to be a part of.’ ”\nThe task force hopes that the first all-gender dorm will be implemented by next fall.\nHjerpe said, “I think it’s definitely realistic, it’s not a question of if, it’s just a question of when. Ideally next year we’ll have some kind of all-gender housing situation set up, but if not, hopefully the year after that. But I think it just depends on the school as a whole, in terms of what the school is ready for, what the faculty wants to take on, and just how quickly we’d be ready for that, [because] an all-gender dorm is really progressive.”\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nHillary Clinton received overwhelming support from Andover students in a survey conducted by The Phillipian, vol. CXXXIX about the presidential race and several other political issues. Of the 1,148 students surveyed, 71.4 percent responded, and 69.2 percent completed the survey. Clinton received 73 percent of the votes, compared to 15.4 percent for Donald Trump. Third-party candidates received the support of 11.7 percent of students – with Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate, taking 7.0 percent of the vote, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, receiving 4.7 percent.\nIn the same survey sent to faculty members, 50 percent completed the survey. Ninety-four percent plan to vote for Clinton and 4.4 percent plan to vote for Trump. Johnson received 1.7 percent of support and not a single faculty member chose Stein.\n\nJohn Rogers, Instructor in Physics, was not surprised by the faculty responses.\n“I think there’s an assumption that everyone on the faculty is supporting Hillary Clinton,” said Rogers. “If it was clear that there was a divide on the faculty, it would be more of an issue than in a typical election.”\nOnly 37 percent of faculty respondents approve of requiring voters to provide a photo ID when voting. In contrast, 64 percent of students favor a law requiring photo ID to vote.\nKyle Welch ’18 said, “You need an ID to drive in the country, you need an ID to get alcohol, you need an ID to do almost anything as a legal adult – except for voting. And [not having a requirement] allows people to cheat the system. It allows for a lot of votes to pop out of thin air without any identification behind them. Having an ID largely prevents that from happening.”\nSeventy-seven percent of student respondents felt that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the United States and eventually apply for citizenship, while 14.0 percent believe they should be required to leave the United States. Ten percent of students surveyed believe people should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally but not be allowed to apply for citizenship.\nTrevor Lazar ’17, a four-year Senior from Scottsdale, Ariz., said, “I think with folks that are already here, they should be allowed to stay in the country and be given a quick and reasonable path to at least a visa or a Green Card, if not citizenship – mainly because they drive a lot of the economic prosperity that has taken hold in parts of the country that have large amounts of undocumented workers. They should be able to gain the protection of the government and make sure their rights as workers are protected.”\nThe results of the survey revealed that 80.5 percent of students would support a U.S. effort to accept refugees from Syria and other places of conflict in the Middle East.\n“I think that as one of the more financially well-off countries in the world, we have a human and moral responsibility to take in refugees,” said Sam Bird ’18. “At the same point, making sure that, for the citizens of this nation, refugees are properly screened, and then making sure that refugees have proper accommodations when they can come to the United States, so they don’t have to worry about housing for the time being.”\nFaculty and student respondents were also asked to answer questions about their views on background checks for gun purchases, income inequality, and hydraulic fracking.\nTo see the full results from the survey, visit politics.phillipian.net.\n\n', 'Oct 29, 2016'), ('\nAndover’s campus has been dominated by the new social media app Houseparty, which allows users to join “parties” and video chat multiple people at the same time. Students of all classes have joined the app’s fanbase, which has exploded in popularity just this week.\nSarah Choi ’18, who admits to using Houseparty nearly every day, said, “I downloaded it about two months ago, around the first few weeks of school. I downloaded because my friend told me to, and it seemed fine. My brother also had it and he’s in Singapore, so that’s how I talked to him. Suddenly, this week, everyone started downloading it, and it got really crazy.”\nSahil Tekchandani ’19 said, “My friend showed me it two or three weeks ago, and then I got it. It was just a couple people who started using it and then everyone got onto it slowly, and now a ton of people have it.”\nSome students have praised Houseparty’s ability to open new lines of conversation between grades and genders, which allows students to get to know peers they may have never spoken with.\n“Houseparty is the most interactive and stimulating social media I’ve ever used,” said Edward Elson ’17. “I’ve been able to talk to people I thought I’d never talk to, and it’s been very cool to get to know students from every grade. I like the lock feature on Houseparty, which allows you to lock a chat and have a more secret, exclusive chat.”\nJackson Davenport ’17 said, “I use it so I can interact with humans who normally I would never talk to and who would be weirded out if I tried to in person. But with this app they can’t avoid me, and it isn’t considered rude to butt in on any conversation I want.”\nMorgan Rooney ’17 enjoys the entertainment factor the app provides but believes that the fad will not last for very long at Andover.\n“I like using Houseparty because it helps me connect with peers who I am sometimes unable to connect with on campus, whether it’s because we don’t have classes together or whatever. It really adds some fun to a tough Senior year,” said Rooney in an interview with The Phillipian over Houseparty.\n“I’d recommend it to friends at least for the next week, and then it will simmer down.

Montenegro began integrating the third-party online publication into Andover’s Health and Wellness program in 2016, and began adding Andover-specific content last winter. The service also offers a text notification that sends info and tips about health and wellness content by texting “PHILLIPS” to 71441. Since then, Student Health 101 has flourished, offering advice and information covering topics such as fitness, mental and sexual health, and college prep.\n\xa0\nWhat is Student Health 101?\nThe intent of this platform is to complement other wellness programming and education that is already happening at Andover, not to replace it or be the only resource. Some of the content is just fun and interesting. Student Health 101 contains information about new health/wellness apps that you can try, healthy recipes, fitness tips, sleep solutions, college prep, etc. in addition to the heavier or more in depth content like depression, anxiety, sexual health, bullying, etc. and so much more.\nWhen did you start Student Health 101?\nStudent Health 101 was started before I began working at Andover. Dr. Patel and our Administrative Director, Cathy Golas, found out about SH 101 and brought it to our campus in 2014. I started to customize our SH 101 with more Andover specific content during winter term 2016, so this is a relatively new platform that we are using. Does anyone help out with the blog? The Student Club heads of Dear Sam, Andrew Cortner ’17 and Niko Skrivanos ’17, provide some student based custom content for the blog. I think it is important to have student involvement in this blog, as peer-to-peer conversation and advice can have a very different impact than adult-to-student conversation and advice. All of their content is approved by me and Dr. Patel before it is posted.\nWhy do you feel the information on your blog is relevant/ necessary for students to know?\nThe content on this blog, both the custom content and that produced by Student Health 101 experts, is vast within the scope of health/wellness, but it is really targeted toward Andover high school students. With that said, it is certainly relevant. The intent of this platform is to complement other wellness programming and education that is already happening at Andover, not to replace it or be the only resource. Some of the content is just fun and interesting.\nDo you have any future goals for this blog?\nI would love to see this blog more widely distributed and accessed across campus by students to students. I think it has a lot of valuable and fun information in it, and I would like to see students engage with it more for their benefit. I would also love to see other student clubs or independent students with an interest in health slash wellness submit content to me to post on the blog. It is intended to be complimentary to all of our other health/ wellness programming, as is our PA Wellness social media platforms.\nWhere do you come up with ideas for articles on your blog?\nThis is an ongoing project for me, and one that I am hoping to explore further during this academic year. Student Health 101 has been slow to start, and their company just went through some major, but good, platform changes over the summer so I am starting from scratch to populate the blog with more information at this point in time. The Wellness Educators here at Andover do provide me with some good topics on occasion. Andrew and Niko from Dear Sam choose their topics based on what their club is focusing on and/or the trends that are taking place in Andover’s current student climate and culture.\nHave you learned anything while researching for your blog that has helped you in your life?\nI think that one should never stop learning. Through researching articles for some of our wellness programming, or working with our team in the Wellness Center to communicate out about information regarding important health and wellness initiatives, I am constantly learning new information. I think challenging oneself intellectually and chasing knowledge is a very important part of one’s own personal well being, and this is something I try to intentionally do in my own life regularly.\nDid you have a resource like this while you were in high school or college? How did you get that information?\nNo, unfortunately, I did not have a resource like this or any of the other health/wellness resources that Andover students currently have when I was in high school and college. I had a personal investment in my own health and wellness and went on to college to study Kinesiology where I was exposed to higher level content related health and wellness as a result of my major. My peers at college who were focusing on other areas of study, however, did not get this information.\nAny health advice for Andover students?\nYour health and wellbeing is the cornerstone of your success. Making time for self-care and establishing balance in your life is something that we all struggle to do at times, but your health and wellbeing should really be your highest priority. Make time for it every day. If you are ill and unwell, then you will be limiting yourself and your success in any given area.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nWith their feet flat on the floor, eyes closed, and arms relaxed, a pensive room of faculty and students were led through a series of mindfulness exercises by Andrew Housiaux, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies and a Fellow with the Tang Institute. This was part of a workshop called “Learning to Listen: Mindfulness and Philosophy” held last Wednesday night.\nHousiaux began the workshop with a short visual presentation and discussed the importance of mindfulness.\n“In moments when we are not mindful, when we are not aware, we have fewer choices. We’re running on instinct, there’s some kind of habitual response– If you’re present, if you’re aware, there are [realistically] more options that you have, more things seem available to you,” said Housiaux in his opening remarks.\nHe quickly segued into activities intended to help attendees practice mindfulness. The exercises began with a form of active meditation, in which participants were instructed to place both feet on the floor, relax their upper bodies, close their eyes, and simply listen to what was going on around them.\nHousiaux talked about how this was meant to get people thinking about mindfulness by making them aware of their surroundings and what was going on around them.\nWilliam Locke ’19, one of the participants, said, “At a place like Andover, we don’t often get a chance to just reflect, especially on how we treat others and ourselves. I think mindfulness, and especially this mindful listening really gave me a chance to do that, and it was really helpful for me mentally.”\nRepeated several times throughout the workshop, this mindful listening exercise allowed participants to recenter themselves and regain their focus between activities.\nFor the next exercise, Housiaux asked audience members to pair up. He then proposed a broad topic of conversation to the group, and instructed everyone to listen to their partner speak on the subject for 90 seconds and do nothing but actively listen.\nAll the activities that were part of the workshop were similarly designed to teach participants techniques that promote self-awareness and mindfulness.\n“I hope that students left the workshop with a sense of how they could listen to other people with curiosity and kindness, and how we could think about pursuing conversations that have deeper understanding– mutual understanding– as a goal, as opposed to merely seeking to triumph in any discussion we find ourselves in,” said Housiaux in an email to The Phillipian.\nThis sentiment seemed to resonate amongst those in the audience, including Flynn Bryan ’18 who believes mindfulness will play an important role in everyday conversation.\n“Conversation is so much more useful when you spend it listening and trying to empathize with the person talking instead of being reactionary, instead of just thinking about your own personal opinion and stances and emotions, because then that prevents any actual education from happening, because they’ll be on the defensive, the same as you,” said Bryan.\nFor Alexandra Macrides ’18, another participant in the workshop, mindfulness may be a useful skill when discussing politics.\n“You need to be able to respect your peers, even if you don’t share their opinions, and their opinion could potentially offend you. Mindfulness is a really good skill to have, to be able to not be offended and [instead] honor the fact that they can have their own opinion and approach that with w\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nOn any given Friday, campus visitors may be perplexed to see large groups of students chatting as they walk to class, decked completely in camouflage, shades of neon, or other puzzling garb. Andover students would know better, however, as team “psyches” have become a colorful part of campus culture.\nMany Varsity and Junior Varsity sports teams schedule these psyches on the day of or before major games. Players emphasize that the fun themes help promote team unity and get players into a collaborative mindset for their games. By dressing up in unusual clothing as a team, players form a solid relationship with their teammates.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Katelyn Wang ’18, a member of Girls Varsity Volleyball, said, “I think [psyches bring] the team together because we’re all doing it together. Even though it might look weird if one person is dressed funny, when we all come together for the picture and we see each other, it’s cool.”\n“I first found out about psyches when my roommate who’s on JV Volleyball dressed up for her first psyche, and I didn’t really know until she told me. I think that, especially for the teams that really get into it, it’s just a source of amusement for other people around campus and just gets everyone really excited about the game,” said Olivia Nolan ’20, a member of Girls JV Field Hockey.\nPsyches also serve as a form of advertisement, “psyching” students up for upcoming games. When students see a certain team dressed up together, they know that there is a game in the coming day or weekend. It draws attention to major tournaments, games, or scrimmages.\n“We’re all bonding by wearing either nice clothes or funny clothes. It also lets the community know that we’re working hard and that we have a competition that day or the next day. And if it’s a home competition we can do some advertising and get our peers to come support us,” said Ethan Brown ’17, a member of Boys Cross Country.\n“I think the psyche is just to get everyone pumped up for the game the next day or the same day and also it brings attention to your game to other people so more people come out to watch,” said Georgia Ezell ’19, a member of Girls Junior Varsity Soccer.\nSome teams have traditional psyches that have become emblematic of their sport over the years. Girls Varsity Soccer has their signature onesies psyche, while members of Boys Cross Country can be spotted wearing sports jackets and colorful shorts on race days.\n“Our second psyche this season was an annual tradition where we wear really nice clothes and then our shortest running shorts on bottom, so that’s always a classic. Almost all of our psyches have been running traditions throughout the years so we’re usually not coming up with new ones,” said Brown.\n“A signature PAVB psyche is the ‘what the hell are you wearing’ psych. So we just dress up in random stuff and really crazy things. That’s one of my favorite ones,” said Wang.\nBritney Bourassa ’18, a member of Girls Varsity Soccer, looks back fondly on memories of Girls Varsity Soccer’s camo psyche, which took team bonding to a whole new level when members took a spontaneous trip to Walmart to gather clothing for the event.\nBourassa said, “I liked camo because of the backstory that went with it– we did a team trip to Walmart to buy camo clothes. It was a bonding experience. We all went and got camo stuff and got a camo umbrella that we were passing around. When you see someone around campus wearing the specific theme of your team, seeing them like that, dressed differently, it’s like ‘Yes!’”\nAlthough some teams have lasting traditions of psyches, it is unclear when or how these psyches originated. The history of psyches and their origins remains a mystery to teams, coaches, and the school, with no information about psyches to be found in the school Archives or the Athletics office.\nEven coaches who have been with their respective teams for years have no idea when this student-led spirit movement began surfacing around campus.\nAlthough psyches and their importance differ for each team, Jeffrey Domina, Boys Cross Country Coach and Instructor in English, believes they ultimately bring the team together.\n“I think teams that have healthy team dynamics tend to compete better. In that way, if the teams that are doing fun, respectful psyches are probably stronger teams in the end. I’m lucky to have a team where I can trust the team’s captain and the team to do whatever they think is appropriate or fun,” said Domina.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nT.U.B. is back — a stack of pencils, with the letters T, U, and B, was scattered all across the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library floor Monday morning. Throughout the day, the administration confisticated all T.U.B. pencils that they found in the library.\nT.U.B., which stands for Truth, Unity, Brotherhood, is a secret society for male students. The group has a tradition of placing a bathtub filled with soft drinks outside of the library at the beginning of each finals week.\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, expressed her concern towards the recent emergence of secret society activities. Prior to Monday’s incident, Madame Sarah Abbott Society (M.S.A.S.), a girls secret society, posted flyers in girls bathrooms. The flyers contained a lip stain at the bottom of the page, along with highlights on “Sarah Abbot” and “for the benefit of Abbot Academy” from Claude Fuess’s book “An Old New England School: A History of Phillips Academy Andover.”\n“The way I feel about the T.U.B. pencils being scattered across the library floor is the same way I feel about the Madame Sarah Abbot posters in the bathrooms. I understand the public good that they’re trying to do, like by offering pencils to people, but as a rule, the school maintains its position that secret societies have no place at Andover. Without any adult supervision, and given that they’re an exclusive organization, it doesn’t align with our community values,” said Elliott in an interview with The Phillipian.\nElliott continued, “If this is work that students on campus feel is really necessary and constructive, I hope that they would go about the acceptable route in terms of creating a student organization and having a faculty advisor and registering it with Mr. Capano [Director of Student Activities] and Student Activities.”\nEarlier this year, students perpetuated the rumor that T.U.B. set off the fireworks that were heard on a Friday night in September. According to Elliott, these claims are baseless.\n“I suppose that with adolescents there’s always a possibility of more serious things happening, so we have messaged loud and clear that fireworks and setting off fireworks are illegal and highly dangerous, and so we would respond accordingly. We really hope students aren’t entertaining ideas like that,” said Elliott.\nSome students believed that the actions of T.U.B. are not harmful at the moment, but may have the potential to become dangerous.\nAbigail N. Ndikum ’20, from Upper Marlboro, Md., said, “I honestly feel like T.U.B. will do more significant things. If they think that people didn’t mind the pencils, they’ll probably try something bigger in the future which may not be safe for us.”\nHowever, other students held slightly different opinions about the presence of secret societies.\n“Honestly, the likelihood is that T.U.B. is more of a club than it is a society, so I don’t see them posing any threats if it’s just a student organization that’s making pencils. It’s not that different from a club that makes posters or buttons,” said Auguste White ’17.\n“Everytime T.U.B. does something, I think it’s intended to start excitement or to make people a little bit happier about their day,” said Abdelaziz Bahnasy ’17.\nOthers remained neutral, but stressed that if T.U.B. grows harmful to the student community, administrative actions should be taken.\n“I think that T.U.B.’s activities are fine as long as no one gets hurt and no one is in danger of getting hurt. If someone is in danger of getting hurt, I think that there should be more action to shut them down,” said Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19.\nVish Dhar ’19 said, “If something bad did happen, I wouldn’t necessarily want the administration to shut [T.U.B.] down, but I would want them to acknowledge that there is a situation that we have and maybe find ways to incorporate it while still being safe.”\nWhite said, “I don’t really know what the administration should do because I feel like in some ways secret societies are exclusive and are harmful to schools, but in other ways, if all our secret societies do are put out tubs of soda, then I don’t have any strong opinion of whether they should stay or go.”\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nDavid Shribman tackled shifts in America’s two-party system and explored similarities between the dynamics of the current election and elections of the past in a talk entitled “The New Architecture of American Politics” this past Tuesday at All School Meeting (ASM).\nShribman is a Pulitzer Prize-winning political pundit and the current Executive Editor of the “Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.” He has covered every presidential election in the United States since Jimmy Carter v. Gerald Ford in 1976 for the Gazette.\nThe main purpose of his talk was to educate students about the election rather than convince them to pick a particular political side.\n“I have a great friend, Mrs. Jeton [Special Assistant to the Head of School] here who called me up and said that she wanted to foster a conversation about the election and have someone explain what the forces at work for the election were, rather than take a side of one or another, to analyze rather than to opinionate,” said Shribman in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThroughout his talk, Shribman alluded to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s current struggle to win the votes of African-Americans.\n“For years, Republicans have tried to get votes from blacks, who were once reliable supporters of the party… it was Lincoln, a Republican, who made the Emancipation Proclamation.Moderate Republicans have provided the margin of victory for both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” said Shribman during his presentation.\n“But since 1968, when Richard Nixon began a southern-strategy aimed at whites and the old confederacy, blacks have redoubled their support for the Democratic party. Now, as perhaps his biggest gamble, Mr. Trump has undertaken an offensive to win black support,” he continued.\nClaudia Meng ’18, one of the two students who introduced Shribman during ASM, found that Shribman was able to educate the Andover community about the current election without offending students with strong political affiliations.\n“[Shribman] compared certain candidates to previous candidates, and he made a lot of links between different campaigns. I have been following the election a lot, and I think he did a really good job of staying politically impartial. I think that makes people a lot more receptive to what [he] has to say because he’s talking about a historical background, the things that he’s saying are less able to be contested because he’s trying to provide a perspective for this year’s election rather than condone or deplore either candidate,” said Meng in an interview with The Phillipian.\nJimin Kim ’20 acknowledged the risk taken by the administration for hosting a talk about the current election, given that Andover’s campus is home to students that identify across the political spectrum.\n“I thought that [the administration] was taking a little risk because if he turned out to be more Democratic than Republican and he showed that in his speech, some students might not have felt that comfortable,” said Kim.\nMembers of the student body found Shribman’s talk to be informative and interesting as it introduced ideas that many hadn’t considered before and explain the reasoning behind certain events in the election.\n“It’s really important I feel that we as young people get engaged in the political process and I’m happy that they brought in a speaker to just talk about things that are going on in this country. I think the speaker did a good job of being fair to all sides and [allowed] us to make informed decisions and really understand how the things that are happening have come to be. I didn’t [have much perspective on] a lot of the stuff he was talking about like blue-collar workers, African-Americans and how they used to be largely Republican, and it’s really brought a new perspective to the way I think I’m going to look at this election,” said Shyan Koul ’19.\nShribman emphasized that it was important to consider the complexity of the changes in the current election and to recognize their historical derivations as well as their future implications.\n“I hope that [students] realize that the campaign is a lot more complex than just… the two candidates yelling at each other and that there are important changes and forces at work in American politics now that are changing the way we look at politics and eventually may change the way we live,” said Shribman.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nLast weekend, Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA) hosted GSA Pride Weekend to raise awareness about LGBTQIA+ issues. As Laila Ballout, faculty advisor to GSA, described to The Phillipian, GSA Pride Weekend also aims to promote the inclusive space needed for the LGBTQIA+ community on campus.\n“Here especially, it’s really open at Andover, and I know at home that people wouldn’t be upset if I came out, but they would definitely look at me differently, so I love that I can celebrate my identity, but it doesn’t define me at Andover,” said Zari Cordova-Potter ’20, a club member of GSA.\nGSA is an organization where all students, regardless of sexual orientation, are welcome. It strives to promote pride and awareness about LGBTQIA+ issues on campus and create a safer school community.\n“The LGBTQIA+ community [at Andover] is incredibly diverse, in who we are and where we’re coming from and how we experience being LGBTQIA+, and having time to share that and to try to convey who you really are is really important. It goes beyond the specific label that you have, so this a time for people to kind of choose how they want to be portrayed rather than kind of sticking one label on themselves and being confined to that,” said Indy Sobol ’17, co-head of GSA.\nGSA Pride Weekend primarily highlighted the change in LGBTQIA+ rights from being taboo to being celebrated.\n“I was really thinking about the queer struggle that has existed forever basically, and we fought so hard. Now, we’re able to just do this so freely, and we don’t even have to be scared of so much punishment. All the fight is now behind us [and] has led us to this moment,” said Nell Fitts ’18, a board member of GSA.\nEvents during the weekend included a GSA parade around campus and a Moth-style storytelling event, a personal storytelling style popularized by The Moth, a non-profit organization that strives to honor and celebrate the diversity and commonality of human experience, in the Underwood Room.\n\n', 'Oct 27, 2016'), ('\nWith music blasting from the top deck of the Frederick L. Nolan Jr. ship, the Class of 2017 sailed around the Boston Harbor on Tuesday night during their first organized Senior dance of the year. According to Christopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, this was the first boat cruise dance since prom seven years ago.\nThe Student Activities Office, along with the Dean of Students Office, arranged the dance to give Seniors a night to de-stress and spend time with friends, according to Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life.\nCapano said, “Last year, we realized that the calendar had this weird day where the Seniors kind of had nothing to do on Tuesday night, and no reason to go to bed early for a test on Wednesday. We realized we could do something fun. My senior year of high school, we did a boat cruise on Boston Harbor and it was super fun– I figured we’d see what we could afford.”\nStudent Activities chartered a vessel from Boston Harbor Cruises to leave from Long Wharf in Boston Harbor, using funds obtained from Student Activities, the Dean of Students Office, and the Head of School’s Office.\nThe boat ride was two hours long and had a D.J., snacks, and soft drinks on board. As students cruised around the harbor, they were able to see the skyline of the city at all times. The cruise was announced as a surprise during last Wednesday’s cluster meetings through a promotional video created by the class representatives, cluster co-presidents, and student body co-presidents. “We decided to have this Senior-only event at this time of the year because this is the time of year when conversations become dominated by stressful topics such as college apps, financial aid, grades, etc. We thought that an event that focused entirely on the Seniors’ enjoyment would be the perfect thing to make sure Senior Fall isn’t full of just stress. We wanted the Seniors to have a night to themselves and to have fun,” said Co-President Madison Pettway ’17. JayShawn Fuller ’17, Abbot Cluster Co-President, said, “One day [the cluster presidents] were having a meeting with the deans and they just kind of said, ‘[the school] rented a boat, we were thinking we could do something with it for our Senior event,’ so we were just kind of like ‘a dance, maybe like a dance on the boat,’ and they were like ‘do you think people will go for it’ and we were like ‘it’s a dance on a boat!’” Because Student Activities put in a deposit to reserve the boat for the evening, students were required to request permission from their cluster deans to opt out of attending the event, according to Elliott. Josie Simmons ’17 and Madeleine Stern ’17, who both attended the boat trip, agreed that the surprise allowed them to take time off from worrying about college applications and bond with their peers. “What I liked about the boat cruise was that it forced me to actually relax, because if I hadn’t gone on the boat cruise I probably would have stayed in and done college apps even more, but I got to meet a lot of new classmates and I had a blast– it actually really did help me de-stress,” Simmons said. Sterns said, “I liked that everyone in our grade got to hang out together without any pressures on us and that we got to meet the PGs and Seniors we didn’t know very well. I think my favorite moment was when we first got on the boat because everyone was so excited to explore the different rooms and decks and take pictures together,” Fuller also considers the class event a success. “Considering all the pictures I saw on Facebook, I think everyone had a pretty good time… I think it was just a really good atmosphere. Like, everyone was really into it, everyone was super willing to participate and super dressed up– It was good to see everyone in the mood for it,” said Fuller. Elliott hopes to offer a similar event next year and keep the tradition of Senior-specific events. “We were lucky; the co-presidents and the class reps were helpful in organizing and pulling things together, so I’m hoping we’ll be able to do something special for Seniors next year too– it may not be the exact same thing but we’ll see how it goes,” said Elliott.\nThe cruise was announced as a surprise during last Wednesday’s cluster meetings through a promotional video created by the class representatives, cluster co-presidents, and student body co-presidents.\n“We decided to have this Senior-only event at this time of the year because this is the time of year when conversations become dominated by stressful topics such as college apps, financial aid, grades, etc. We thought that an event that focused entirely on the Seniors’ enjoyment would be the perfect thing to make sure Senior Fall isn’t full of just stress. We wanted the Seniors to have a night to themselves and to have fun,” said Co-President Madison Pettway ’17.\nJayShawn Fuller ’17, Abbot Cluster Co-President, said, “One day [the cluster presidents] were having a meeting with the deans and they just kind of said, ‘[the school] rented a boat, we were thinking we could do something with it for our Senior event,’ so we were just kind of like ‘a dance, maybe like a dance on the boat,’ and they were like ‘do you think people will go for it’ and we were like ‘it’s a dance on a boat!’”\nBecause Student Activities put in a deposit to reserve the boat for the evening, students were required to request permission from their cluster deans to opt out of attending the event, according to Elliott.\nJosie Simmons ’17 and Madeleine Stern ’17, who both attended the boat trip, agreed that the surprise allowed them to take time off from worrying about college applications and bond with their peers.\n“What I liked about the boat cruise was that it forced me to actually relax, because if I hadn’t gone on the boat cruise I probably would have stayed in and done college apps even more, but I got to meet a lot of new classmates and I had a blast– it actually really did help me de-stress,” Simmons said.\nSterns said, “I liked that everyone in our grade got to hang out together without any pressures on us and that we got to meet the PGs and Seniors we didn’t know very well.

Citing the Blue Book rule that prohibits students from running on-campus businesses, two high-level deans asked Pacific Peak to rethink its status as an organization on campus.\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, and Fernando Alonso, Dean of Administration and Finance, met with Will Kantaros ’18, Pacific Peak’s Chief Operating Officer, and David Tsai ’18, the company’s Chief Business Development Officer, on Tuesday.\n“It was a very productive meeting,” said Kantaros, who oversees all of its day-to-day operations and financial affairs. “We got to tell them more about who we are and what we’re about. It was a very open dialogue, we were very honest with each other, and we didn’t want to feel as if we were cheating the school or going behind the school’s back at all, and they felt the same way.”\nIn recent weeks, administrators have been wary of how Pacific Peak’s business could hurt the school’s non-profit status, said Alonso. He confirmed that this concern prompted the recent intervention.\nCourtesy of Pacific PeakPacific Peak aspires to become a completely non-profit business.\n\n\xa0\nIn early September, Kantaros reached out to the Athletic Department about “sponsoring” team apparel. He proposed that the clothing company be the school’s go-to manufacturer for team apparel; Holden Ringer ’17, Captain of Andover Boys Cross Country, expressed interest in Pacific Peak managing his team’s apparel. That prospect was soon shut down when Leon Modeste, Athletic Director, told Kantaros that the school was not allowed to conduct business with students, said Kantaros. At the beginning of October, Tsai was in contact with Chris Capano, Director of Student Activities, and Elliott. He asked if the five Cluster Deans could incorporate a Pacific Peak video into last week’s All-Cluster Meetings.\nElliott responded by scheduling a meeting with the group’s leaders to confirm that the organization was non-profit, which is not the case, said Kantaros. Due to time constraints, however, the meeting never happened, causing the video to not be shown. Kantaros explained that Pacific Peak then sought to sponsor the Class of 2018’s apparel, coordinating T-shirt designs with 2018’s Class Representatives and Advisors.\nElliott, however, then emailed Kantaros and Tsai earlier this week, instructing Pacific Peak to sever all plans for sponsoring apparel until the company received approval from Alonso, as well as Maureen Ferris, Director of Risk Management, and Andrea Nix, Chief Finance Officer, said Kantaros.\nOn Tuesday, Elliott and Alonso met with Kantaros and Tsai. The aim of the discussion, said Alonso, was to figure out how Pacific Peak could still operate without interfering with the school’s non-profit status.\n“We explained to Ms. Elliott and Mr. Alonso the intent of our company and the impact we wish to have on this campus,” wrote Tsai in an email to The Phillipian. “Knowing that we now have the school’s support, we can focus on our mission to promote environmental awareness on and off campus.”\nKantaros and Tsai walked out of the meeting with three options on the table: become a club, operate off campus, or close up shop.\nCurrently Pacific Peak is not formally recognized as a club, which restricts it from attending club rallies and thereby prevents students from joining under the same circumstances other clubs follow. If it does become a club, Pacific Peak would host weekly meetings to educate students on environmental issues and give participants a chance to be involved in its clothing affairs, said Kantaros. But he’s concerned that becoming a club would cause the team to lose its autonomy.\n“Pacific Peak, for me, has been a great learning experience in running a company and working with individuals as a group, and creating and selling a product, and operating a business. I personally feel that, as a club, we’d be giving away some of those powers and some of that freedom, and we’d be handing it over to the school. That’s my biggest hesitation,” said Kantaros.\nThe second option involves distancing the organization’s operations from campus. As Pacific Peak operates in 30 schools across six different countries, the group believes that, if it shifts some of its practices off-campus, it should be recognized as an ordinary company in the eyes of the administration.\n“I asked Mr. Alonso a few times what it meant to be operating on-campus as a business. Legally, we’re run out of Boston; our address for the company is in Boston, and we have workers and members of Pacific Peak all over the country and in South Korea as well,” said Kantaros.\n“If the list of things that would make us as an off-campus entity is fairly simple to accomplish, then it should be a pretty easy fix – like if that means not shipping our shirts from Andover’s mailroom or not using Andover’s servers to edit our website,” he continued.\nEven if Pacific Peak decides to become an off-campus entity, the group’s members are still technically at risk of receiving disciplinary action. The Blue Book, on page 40, designates “running or serving as an agent for any business while on campus” as a Major Offense, which, the rulebook says, oftens warrants a Disciplinary Council meeting to determine formal punishment.\n“There is a third option and that is: Pacific Peak gets shut down in its entirety. It’s currently doubtful that that will happen,” said Kantaros.\nPacific Peak’s ethos is its commitment to protecting the environment and informing students about environmental causes, said Kantaros. All of the profits that Pacific Peak generates, as they claim, are donated to environmental organizations.\n“Our company is centered around the environment, and even though our entire planet is being affected [by climate change], one of the most commonly known bodies of water is the Pacific Ocean,” wrote Tsai in a previous email to The Phillipian.\nFrom last February to May, Pacific Peak has made four donations to The Climate Group, a non-profit organization that promotes clean-energy policies, totalling 3,650 dollars.\nRecently, Pacific Peak launched a Kickstarter to crowdfund its initiative to use 100 percent recyclable materials in its products. Out of its 9,000-dollar goal, the team has raised 8,345 dollars, at the time of printing.\nPacific Peak has garnered a fair amount of fanfare over the last year. The company’s signature T-shirts and light-blue hats have become a fixture on campus.\nNicole Cho ’19, who has modeled for the company on its Instagram page, owns two of its shirts.\n“I really like their cause, because it supports the environment. I just think it’s really nice to do. They donate a lot of their profits to different associations,” said Cho.\n\n', 'Oct 21, 2016'), ('\n\n\n\nAfter starting his career in journalism at The Phillipian, media mogul Greg Zorthian ’71, currently managing direc- tor at a media consulting firm, has accumulated over 40 years of experience in the publish- ing industry.

There are other people that are going to want to do the same thing – it’s a competitive world out there – so I learned some things that weren’t obvious to me at the time, but as I grew, I realized that there was a pattern there.\nWhat specific memories from Andover do you have that still stand out to you?\nI clearly enjoyed working on the paper, because I contin- ued to do it in college and af- terwards. It was a way to learn about myself. It was something I thought I wanted to do, and actually enjoy doing it. It was\n\n\nmy first try at journalism, and it was a great opportunity to do it. Andover was so great, even back then they gave you that opportunity.\nIn what aspects has Ando- ver changed since you were here as a student?\nIt’s gone co–ed. I think the students are so much more ma- ture, and so much brighter, and so much more motivated. The Andover I went to was fairly homogeneous – and now you have international and global students, and you learn a lot more.\nWhat are some personal traits that have contributed to your success?\nOne of the things that has helped me succeed is I have great respect for the people I work with, both the people I work for and the people who work for me. The other thing IliketothinkisthatIhavea decent sense of humor, and I think that’s pretty important. If you are so self-important and don’t try to understand other people, then you are not going to succeed.\nWhat is one challenge you’ve faced throughout your career, and how did you overcome it?\nImpatience… I sometimes got bored easily and was ready\xa0for the next job. Being able to rethink a job that you’ve done for a while and refocus, figure out another aspect to another thing you could work on is something I’ve learned, but it took me some time. When I started out my career at Time Inc., it was a fast-moving busi- ness. You would have a new job every year, which also meant you never really learned any- thing nor did you have much\xa0impact on anything. But the first time in my life, when I was in a job for five years, that was an eye-opener because I found that I was accountable for decisions I had made. You learn to make more thought through decisions.\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give to Andover students who are interested in the media business?\n\n\n\nAt some point, you are going\xa0to have to decide whether you want to specialize in some- thing, in some aspect, and then can you be the best at it. This business is going to be harder and harder, but the people who are the best will succeed.

While religion could be celebrated in many forms, religious holidays often signify a day devoted solely to spiritual pratice and reflec- tion.\nAs a result, this Wednesday, all classes were cancelled to honor Yom Kippur, considered by many to be the most impor- tant holiday in the Jewish faith.\nThe Phillipian asked com- munity members about their opinions on the celebration of religious holidays during the school year. Students had varied thoughts about how Andover should embrace a wider range of religious celebration.\nFeatures A8\nIt’s Friday the 14th!\nFeatures encounters bad luck as Features can’t read a calendar.\nHappy Freaky Friday!

The school, for the first time, can- celled all classes on September 12 this year in recognition of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha. Khan described how the absense of classes allowed her to focus solely on spritual practice.\n“As a Muslim who celebrates Eid al-Adha… [celebrating] this was a very big deal for me. Last year, I had to take the day off, missing classes… but I am very grateful the school gave the day off for the whole school this year,” said Khan in an email to The Phillipian.\nSome students, however, de- scribed the challenges they face in celebrating certain religious holidays that coincide with school days. Currently, Andover still holds classes on numerous\nArts B5-B8\nTransforming Lives Through Tumblr\nJennifer Lu ’19 blogs to awareness for mental health and positivity.\n\n\nholidays such as Buddha’s Birth- day, Diwali, and Lunar New Year. In contrast, the school organizes special schedules for the Chris- tian holiday of Good Friday, hav- ing students attend shortened periods of classes.\nPaige Busse ’19, from West- field, N.J., pointed out how hav- ing school on important holi- days force some students to miss classess, which burdens them with loads of work to catch up. Busse, who observes Good Fri- day, stated how students should not sacrifice their academics for personal belief.\n“I wish that we had Good Fri- day off. For [those who observe], Holy Thursday and Good Friday are the most holy days of the year. Even Christmas isn’t as im- portant,” she said.\n\n\n\n“It’s very difficult to miss a day of school because you have to catch up on all your work. It makes it inconvenient, and it makes you choose between your academic and religious life… So do you sacrifice your academic life for your beliefs?” she continued.\nIn addition to missing class- es, some students described how religious rituals often im- pact academic performance. For instance, this year the Muslim holy month of Rama- dan coincides with the end of the school year, requiring that the Muslim community fast during the Extended Period Week when students are given major assignments.\n“Although I understand it is too late for anything to be done now, the coming years will see Ramadan falling earlier and earlier during the school year – it moves back eleven days every year. I hope that in the coming years, some measures will be taken to help those fasting during the long, warm school hours,” said Khan.\nOthers emphasized that the school should cancel classes on cultural holidays as stu- dents deserve to spend time with their family on such oc- cassions. With an increas- ing number of students with\n\n\ndifferent ethnic and national backgrounds, Andover did not include cultural holidays such as the the Lunar New Year, a day widely celebrated in mul- tiple East and South East Asian countries.\nKaitlin Kan ’18, hailing from Villanova, Pa., said, “I’m gener- ally happy with how the school handles different holidays, and how they schedule it into the master schedule… though, my one wish is that the school can consistently have Chinese New Year off or work it somehow into the long winter break so I can go home and spend it with my family.”\nBusse suggested that the school could accomodate for more religious and cultural holidays by adding school days to the end of the academic year.\n“We have a three-month- long summer break. If we had one more week of classes, it wouldn’t be the end of the world… I know that a lot of kids express that we have a short- ened year, but to have days off in the middle of the term would be so much easier to manage,” said Busse.\n“Even for kids who are not religious, the [days off ] are beneficial. It is a time for them to reflect and practice mindful- ness,” Busse continued.\nRajesh Mundra, Assistant Dean of Students, discussed\n\n\nhow the school, promoting eq- uity and inclusion, is open to embracing more discussions on which holidays are significant.\n“Over the years, the school has been more sensitive to acknowledging student back- grounds and especially, reli- gious backgrounds… When you have ‘Youth from Every Quar- ter’, we have youth from many different backgrounds, many different faiths, many different beliefs… The school is under- standing of people’s personal time to observe different faith traditions and celebrate tradi- tions,” he said.\n“I think the administration would be open to hearing more from students and from faculty about how to better support students… It’s an ongoing dis- cussion, and I think it’s an im- portant discussion to have,” he continued.\nMundra further emphasized how celebrating holidays is not only limited to recognition and understanding on campus.\n“The school is not only just celebrating within our commu- nity and understanding what these holidays mean, but also giving time off to students to be able to celebrate with their families or in their own way with our own resources or the resources in town,” Mundra concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Oct 19, 2016'), ('\n\n\n\nThousands of spam emails are filtered every day by the An- dover server, yet phishing emails aiming to deceive students and faculty into revealing their pass- words and personal information have bombarded inboxes around campus.

If I was on my com- puter in my dorm by myself, I probably would have looked into it more and clicked some of the links and then messed up and got hacked or something. So I really don’t want these emails to be sent anymore.”\nZinterhofer said, “I think in the future, I’ll be more vigi- lant when I see these types of emails come through.

There’s no rugs, nothing to designate the area, there’s no sign. Actually, this year, they’ve put a bench there so students can sit there and work, which is very uncomfortable because when I go up there to pray, there might be someone sitting there, working,” said Illikkal in an inter- view with The Phillipian.\nOver the past decade, many Muslim students at Andover have utilized the top of the staircase in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library for religious prayers. While many other faiths have designated worship places on campus, the Muslim community at Andover lacks sanctioned space to pray.\n\n\nThis was one of the many issues Illikkal discussed on Friday in her Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) presentation, “Diversifying Youth From Every Quarter – An Action Plan for Muslim Students at Phillips Academy.” Illikkal, the presi- dent of Andover’s Muslim Stu- dent Association (M.S.A.), is one of this year’s CAMD Scholars. llikkal said during her presentation, “Islam requires a space where one can stand, kneel, prostrate, and bow. In past years, a prayer space for all the religions has been open in the basement of the Cochran Chapel, yet due to misuse it is often locked and can be only opened with prior notice. A permanent prayer space needs to be in an area that is easily and regularly accessible.”\n\n\n\nIn her presentation, Illikkal shared her personal experience as a Muslim student at Andover.\n“For my swim test, I didn’t feel comfortable with being in the pool with boys, so I just sat on the side during P.E. while the others were in the pool. I took my swim test afterwards and Ms. Birecki, my P.E. teacher at the time, covered up all of the windows so no one could peek in. That was really touch- ing to me,” said Illikkal in an interview with The Phillipian.\nFollowing Illikkal’s presentation, a group of panelists comprised of Meredith Rahman ’10, Teaching Fellow in\n\n\nBiology, as well as Zahra Mar- hoon ’17, Saadiya Lakhani ’17, and Zizo Bahnasy ’17 discussed issues such as the lack of prop- er halal meals regularly acces- sible in Paresky Commons.\nBahnasy said in an inter- view with The Phillipian, “Last year, we worked something out with Agatha Kip, the nutritionist on campus, and we had [Paresky] Commons begin to buy halal chicken. Halal means that it’s cut properly and pre- pared properly for Muslims. It doesn’t cost that much more to get halal chicken, so they did it. The thing is, they only did it for certain forms of chicken at Andover, and we don’t always know what those forms of chicken are, and we also don’t have halal beef.”\n\n\nIllikkal was inspired to present on Muslim representation at Andover because of her experience with M.S.A. Over the course of her time at Andover, she became more passionate about the club after noticing the diverse group of Muslim students that are pres- ent on campus.\n“Everyone came from a dif- ferent background, so some of the students were practicing while others weren’t, some were international, and some were local. It was such a wide variety that I wanted to cap- ture these students experienc- es because they were so unique and I think most people think of Islam as a monologue when actually it’s quite a mosaic,” said Illikkal in an interview\xa0with The Phillipian.\n\n\nM.S.A. was mostly inactive\xa0throughout her Junior year. However, after arrival of David Fricke, Sports Information Di- rector and current M.S.A. fac- ulty advisor, the club became more engaged. Fricke served as Illikkal’s faculty advisor throughout her project.\n“The vibe I got from the audience was that there was a connection and the students were able to open up during the panel and talk about the difficulties of being Muslim, but also times when they felt that Andover presented a sup- portive community. It looked like people really related to her on different levels when it was about very personal experiences,” said Fricke.\n\n\nIllikkal remains positive that Andover’s growth envi- ronment will facilitate the change towards a better Mus- lim student experience.\n“Despite the many challenges, change at Andover is definitely possible. As one student said, the faculty and students are very understanding. Andover wants to engage with things we don’t yet know or fully understand. Andover has both the desire and the devotion to make the changes that I mentioned. I hope that all of you will join me in creating a more supportive community for the Muslim students here,” concluded Illikkal in her presentation.\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n', 'Oct 19, 2016'), ('\n\n\n\nIlluminated by radiating blue light from glow sticks, students gathered around the Armillary Sphere, hand-in- hand, and stood in silence at the “Walk Into the Light” Vigil last Friday night.\nActive Minds, a club dedicat- ed to spreading mental-health awareness and educating stu- dents on mental health related topics, hosted the event in hon- or of Mental Illness Awareness Week.

[When] it’s not talked about, it’s very iso- lating, I think, and it’s also very unhealthy.”\n\n\n\nDuring the vigil, students chatted about mental health, awareness, and schoolwork as they walked down the Vis-\n\n\nta, creating a starkly different atmosphere from traditional- ly-silent vigils.\n“I really like the idea that we were talking to each other as we were walking,” said Tif- fany Chang ’19, a participant in the walk. “I think that it might be powerful if we had walked in silence, but I also think of\n\n\nthe very fact that we were en- couraged to talk to each other cultivated an atmosphere of openness. Even if we weren’t talking about mental health, we were just getting to know other people who cared about similar things.”\nAfter walking from Sam- uel Phillips Hall to the Ar- millary Sphere on the Great Lawn, the participants formed a circle around the structure and joined hands. They re- flected in silence as Active Minds’ board members spoke about the significance of rais- ing mental-health awareness.

It’s on our minds constantly, particularly in light of the tragedy that is irredeemable: death. For me, it affected me quite intimate- ly. My younger child fell asleep last night crying. And he asked me if there was ever a time without racism – did it ever not exist,” said Perry in her presentation.\nPerry argued that racial in- equality has always been a cul- tural practice in America. Her talk last Thursday continued Ando- ver’s “Our Divided House” series on the intersection of race, his- tory, and public policy.\n“It is not simply the fact that we’re dealing with a past history of inequality, but that as a soci- ety, we act consistently in ways that sustain and extend racial inequality. It is the cumulative impact of acts of digression that advantage or disadvantage people based upon their membership,” said Perry, who has a doctorate in American Civilization from Har- vard University.\nDespite the embracement of racial equality in modern soci- ety, Perry contended that racial inequality still persists due to its long history in America. “Dis- crimination is manifested in the racial wealth gap that plagues so- ciety today,” she said.\nPerry cited three examples to illustrate how current society still sustains racial inequality: the power of positions, credit in pur- chases, and the housing market. From her research, Perry deter- mined that people of color, for instance, pay more on average for bigger purchases, like houses or cars, than white people do.\n“Something is happening to make someone selling the car say [that] that person, because of the flesh they happen to be born with, ought to pay more,” said Perry. “That has to do with practices of racial inequality that we’re taught and socialized into. It doesn’t have to be explicit or conscious. Prac\n\n\n\ntices are learned in language, in the categories we put people into.” In her presentation, Perry also addressed name-based dis- crimination and associations that decrease the value of African– American associated objects and words. For example, studies show that people with Spanish–sound- ing or African-American sound- ing names are less likely to get in- terviews when applying for work. Perry described situations where her race led to worse treatment than her white counterparts in re-\ntail stores and restaurants.\n“On one hand, [being treated differently because of my race was] insulting… But it also means that the exchange value of a dol- lar in my hand is actually less than it is for some of my counterparts because I don’t get the same kind of experience in exchange. It’s all along a continuum of deciding that certain people ought to be valued less that’s part of our cul-\nture,” said Perry.\nLauryn Roberts ’17 recognized\nthe importance of empathy across racial groups in achieving a more respectful racial environment on campus.\n“It’s important to have under- standing and respect, and under- stand that not everyone is going to be hyper–affected by the issues about racism,” said Roberts. “But it’s also important to have the capacity to realize that it’s some- thing that people struggle with and you should have empathy. I know what it feels like because I do identify as black, but my best friend doesn’t. But she under- stands that it’s hard for me. It’s important that [we] respect for each other, definitely at a place like this.”\nLin Gan ’19 described the pre- sentation as eye-opening and ex- pressed appreciation for Perry\n\n\n\nsharing her experiences as an African-American woman.\nGan said, “[Perry] offers a new perspective. Although racial [is- sues are] one giant topic, there [are] so many perspectives to that… It was actually my first time to hear someone who is African- American acknowledge that [she] has not been treated the same way other people have. It’s very eye- opening.”\nPerry also emphasized the im- portance of applying respect and equality to everyday life.\n“Try to be deliberate about be- ing broadly inclusive about treat- ing people with utmost respect, and not making a series of as- sumptions or presumptions about where they come from and what they think. Careful listening really has potential to make a big differ- ence, and not be defensive when touchy-race subjects come up,” said Perry in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“Justice is always urgent… There’s always been people who are suffering, there’s always been people who are mistreated, who are excluded. It is a life mission because there’s only so much you can do at every stage in your life. But if you make a lifelong commit- ment to being fair and just, then you can make a huge impact over time,” Perry continued.\nPerry’s talk was the second of the three-part “Our Divided House” series, which offers a dif- ferent perspective on the current racial climate in America by tying together history and public policy. The series concluded with a pre- sentation on Wednesday by David Canton, an associate professor of history and Director of the Afri- cana Studies Program at Connect- icut College.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Oct 19, 2016'), ('\nAndrew Wang ’18, Kevin Sun ’18, and Jocelyn Shen ’18 organized the first-ever Hack New England High Schools (hackNEHS), which was held last Saturday. Hosted by Microsoft in their Burlington Mall headquarters, 30 of the over 250 attendees were from Andover with the rest arriving from other high schools in the area. During the day, students spent nine hours networking, attending workshops, designing, and building original software-based products. \nThe event was organized in order to allow high school coders to learn more about their craft and to have the experience of participating in an event typically geared towards their older peers. \nHigh school students don’t often have that many chances to participate in something like a hackathon because they are normally college events. They are for people who stay up all of one night to code. This event was specifically tailored for high school students, and it’s a really good experience for students to learn how to design a product. Most of the people I talked to after the event said that they learned a lot about coding just in those nine hours. And I think that’s great.\nSeveral leaders in the technology industry opened the day by addressing the students. The program then led into four workshops covering different coding programs, ideation, and computer processing. After the opening ceremony, teams of six to eight students dispersed from the big conference room into the smaller design rooms to work on their product’s design, source code, and logo.\nFinished products ranged from websites, mobile applications, and games. Sam Xifaras ’18 and his group designed a 2-D fighting game using Java. \n“I went to my first hackathon on Sunday. I would describe it as [a place where students are] collaborating and building something that is innovative and entrepreneurial. From our perspective, the most challenging part was getting started with an idea,” Xifaras said.\nWang felt inspired to organize hackNEHS after attending several hacking and technology events last year in Cambridge, Mass. With the help of Sun, Wang began planning the logistics of the event and the website last year. Over the summer, Shen also joined the team.\nShen said, “High school students don’t have many chances to participate in something like a hackathon, because they are normally college events. This event was specifically tailored for high-school students, and it was a really good experience for students to learn how to design a product.”\nThe three Andover students also collaborated with Alec Sun PEA’17 and Vinjai Vale PEA’18, as well as a group of 20 mentors from Google Creative Labs, Cisco, and Amazon as well as software engineers and computer-science teachers. \n“The most exciting moment was when we were giving out the awards. People came up to us afterwards telling us how much fun they had and thanking us for this opportunity. Our work really paid off,” said Shen.\nAfter nine hours of coding, collaborating, and designing, students presented their products to a panel of four software entrepreneur judges, who graded the projects based on three categories: functionality, creativity, and technical difficulty. \nAt the end of the day, Andover’s team won with a personalized music generator. The team included Buzzy Barrow ’18, Darcy Meyer ’18, Alex Reichenbach ’18, Annika Sparrell ’18, Neil Masri ’19, and Varun Roy ’19.\n“We worked together really well, which is probably why we did well. Our product was a generative music model in which you would go to this website and it would play generated computer music continuously so that you wouldn’t get distracted. It worked with the Hooktheory API and the probabilistic random walk mobility model for the melody. It was really fun, but quite stressful. I am definitely going to next year’s hackathon,” Reichenbach said.\nStudents were not required to have any prior coding experience or even a team. Attendees were also not charged admission fee thanks to competition’s sponsors which included Microsoft, Facebook, and Chipotle. \n\n', 'Oct 16, 2016'), ('\n\n\n\nAndover established a new program for Juniors this year to help facilitate their transition to high school and their new lives on campus. “Foundations for Freshmen,” or PACE-9, is taken by all Juniors during their Eng- lish red-dot period once a week.\nOne of the main pillars of An- dover’s Empathy and Balance curriculum, Foundations was implemented to fulfill the Stra- tegic Plan Committee’s recom- mendation for a developmental health and wellness curriculum. The program will eventually evolve into a four-year program for all students.\nAbhinav Tadikonda ’20 said, “We learn about physical and mental resources like [Rebec- ca M. Sykes Wellness Center], meeting with teachers for extra help, and study halls that we can go to. And it eases our transi- tion into the school. For a lot of people, it’s hard to adjust to the work and sleep, so we learned about how to deal with that. It’s just a safe place for people to talk with each other and discuss their problems.”\nThe Foundations curriculum includes activities and games regarding topics such as available resources, wellness, and identity. Topics that fall under those categories include sleep, nutrition, drugs and alcohol, sexual health, and healthy relationships. Emotional, physical, and social health are also touched upon.\n\n\n\n\n“No one wants to seem vulnerable and no one wants to seem like they don’t have their act together… [This program is] for them to understand and normalize the experience and transition…Sleep is important, [nutrition is important], and hygiene is important… Hopefully providing kids with more information in a fairly organized way helps them,” said Aya Murata, Ninth Grade Course Head of the Empathy & Balance Program.\nThe establishment of Foun- dations responds to student and faculty complaints about the condensed nature of cur- rent PACE classes. The goal of the Foundations program is to introduce students to topics that will be built upon in fu- ture dorm conversations, day student advising groups, and classroom situations, ensuring that each subject is thoroughly discussed and understood.\n“One of the criticisms about PACE [is that] it’s gotten much more condensed over the years. First it was a year, and then it was two terms, and now it’s become one term…You drop in on all these topics and it’s like, drop and go. There’s no sustained conversation be- yond that about particular top- ics,” said Murata.\nMost responses have been overwhelmingly positive, with some Juniors feeling reassured and more confident after being made aware of the resources they can utilize on campus through Foundations. Emma Slibeck ’20 has taken advan- tage of many resources offered at Andover that she was made aware of through Foundations.\n“I go to the [biology] study hall and math study hall a lot. Math study hall was really useful because I struggled with geometry for a bit. It’s getting better, so I just think that having the resource[s] to go to felt better than just [feeling] plain lost in postulates and theorems,” said Slibeck ’20.\n\n\nHywot Ayana ’20 said, “It’s\xa0important that we all know what’s available and not be surprised once we are struggling. We just know [the information] beforehand.”\nThe Junior groups are led by faculty and Upper volunteers. The majority of Uppers who are involved in the program are prefects of Junior dorms. Max Rigby-Hall ’18 finds these Uppers offer an experienced voice and perspective to the new class.\n“Having [Juniors] be taught by and work with fellow stu- dents, especially upperclass- men, is incredibly important because they can learn about experiences we have had and hopefully feel less alone… Last year, being friends with up- perclassmen made me feel so much better and made me feel like a real part of the school… Also, students are less afraid to ask questions of their peers, so the [Juniors] know they can ask us anything in or outside of class,” said Rigby-Hall in an email to The Phillipian.\nRachel Hyland, Instructor in Spanish, who serves as an advisor to one Foundations group, hopes to teach her Ju- nior students to find balance in their lives at Andover through the program.\nHyland said, “Oftentimes students are so focused on just their academics… it’s good to find balance. We want to teach kids not just how to study his- tory or language or math. We want to teach them to live bal- anced, healthy lives, which is probably more important than any of that. It helps you learn.”\nFoundations is planned to become a diploma requirement. The course will require no homework and does not provide any final grade. At the end of this pilot year, a faculty vote will decide the effective- ness and official establishment of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Oct 14, 2016'), ('\n\n\n\n“The Exonian,” the student-run newspaper of Phillips Exeter Academy, which describes itself as an uncensored paper in its charter, has had password encryption on its site since early September. The Exeter administration effected this change in light of recent sexual misconduct cases at the school. The administration has concerns that students featured in “The Exonian” could attract unwanted attention from large-scale media sources, according to Philip Kuhn PEA’17, Editor in Chief of “The Exonian”.\nThe website of “The Exonian” can only be accessed after readers enter their email addresses along with the password “FreePress,” which is displayed on the login page. With this policy, the Exeter administration hopes to hold viewers of the site accountable for their use of content on the site, as well as to protect students’ privacy by preventing Internet-keyword searches from accessing articles on the website, according to Brandon Liu, Chief Digital Editor of “The Exonian Online”; it is no longer possible for “The Exonian” articles to appear in Google search results. The decision to put a login page on “The Exonian Online” was a compromise the newspaper reached with administrators after the school asked the paper to put its website on Exeter’s intranet, according to Liu –\xa0which would have restricted access to anyone who didn’t have an account registered with the school.\nThe Exeter administration reached out to “The Exonian” board last January about drafting a clear policy for the management of the paper’s online content in order to protect student privacy, according to Liu. Over the summer, “The Exonian” website was repeatedly shut down without the board members knowing. This event spurred Kuhn and Liu to create the policy for online usage. In general, Kuhn has noticed increased administrative involvement with his paper this year.\n“I definitely feel we have gotten more pressure from the administration than we did a year ago. A year ago when I was doing this job, I never even thought about the administration – I never talked with them,” said Kuhn in an interview with The Phillipian.\nLiu believes that the recent changes to the paper’s online operations are a response to Exeter’s recent bout of highly-publicized sexual-assault cases. \n“I think it does [relate to the sexual-misconduct stories,] in the sense that the school is looking to minimize potential avenues through which personal information can be misused or unfairly presented,” said Liu. “They’re looking to protect students’ and community members’ safety, and I think that’s their No. 1 concern. I think these steps that they’re taking are towards that goal.”\nOne of the recent cases of sexual misconduct at Exeter, involving two minors, emerged last January. The case resulted in the involuntary leave of the accused male student, while the female student remained on campus. The accused student then filed a lawsuit against the school last August for wrongful expulsion, accusing the administration of a biased investigation, according to a report by the “Union Leader”.\nAfter “The Exonian” reached out to the female student for comment on a story they planned to run on the lawsuit, the administration soon became aware that the newspaper was planning to cover the story, according to Kuhn.\nOn October 2, members of “The Exonian” board met with Exeter’s Interim Directors of Health and Well-Being, Tina Sciocchetti and Jane Stapleton-Deziel, who were appointed this year to the newly-instated position in light of the sexual-misconduct cases at Exeter. During the meeting, which was called to discuss the administration’s concern for the student’s safety on campus, “The Exonian” was prohibited from covering the story, according to Liu. \n“The wording I remember most clearly,” said Liu. “[It] was to the effect of: The administration is in control of all student organizations, of which ‘The Exonian’ is one, and students don’t have the First Amendment right on campus. The problem was that we didn’t have a discussion about what had come about from it. If we had had a conversation beforehand, that would have eliminated any need to shut it down, because we would have understood what was going on.”\n“In the end,” Liu said, “it was clear that we had no choice.”\nKuhn is not convinced that the “The Exonian” editors made the right choice when they initially decided to cover the story. \n“I’ll admit right now that I regret that decision, I don’t think that was the best journalism there, although I do understand where we were coming from as in really letting [the female student] have her voice, because her voice wasn’t really included in [professional news coverage]… It was very much from the side of the guy,” said Kuhn.\nDespite the administration’s prohibition of the sexual-misconduct article and password encryption of “The Exonian Online,” Kuhn still considers the paper to be uncensored. \n“The reason why we still call ourselves uncensored is because that is one case, and one very specific case, and none of our articles go by the administration. They don’t know what we are running beforehand; the only reason they knew of this is because word spread around,” said Kuhn.\nOver the last few weeks, the newspaper’s login page has been repeatedly edited. The page now states: “ ‘The Exonian’ still seeks to maintain its status as the uncensored, free and open student press, and we are working together with the school administration in these goals.”\nWhen reached for comment, Lisa MacFarlane, Principal of Exeter, referred The Phillipian to Ron Kim, Vice Principal of Exeter. Kim, who was traveling at the time, provided a short statement in an email to The Phillipian.\n“We are very supportive of the work of our students at ‘The Exonian.’ At the same time, one of our priorities is the safety and well-being of the students in our care, and thus access to information about our students online has to be considered responsibly, which is why we are working with ‘The Exonian’ web editors to address this concern,” Kim wrote.\n“We want to ensure that no one in the community is harmed by something written in the newspaper. \xa0I know these are goals that we all share,” he continued.\nKuhn agrees with Kim’s concerns about student safety.\n“I think [it’s] most important to address [this change] with the students, making sure they understand that what is going on the web will stay there, having a policy to show parents, and explaining to both of those parties that we are going to help guide [the] student through it and that we can be trusted,” said Kuhn.\nSeveral incidents of sexual misconduct at Exeter have occurred or been uncovered over the past year. Last spring, “The Boston Globe” published an investigative article on multiple sexual-misconduct cases that occurred at Exeter during the 1970s and 1980s. This revelation resulted in permanent ban from campus of Rick Schubart, a former faculty member who was required to retire in 2011, and the arrest of Arthur Peekel, a former admissions officer, as reported by “The Globe.” Another case, which took place last fall and was covered by “The Globe,” resulted in a male student being charged with the sexual assault of a female student. \nThe Exeter administration has expressed a great deal of concern over cases that regarded minors, according to Kuhn. “The Exonian” board met with the administration earlier this week to discuss the paper’s approach to future cases, and to map out its relationship with students and faculty going forward.\n“[The meeting] went well,” wrote Kuhn in an email to The Phillipian. “The idea of a portal was never brought up and they certainly did not try to pressure us into any further changes or blockages. The meeting was more to clarify how our paper and the administration should navigate their relationship in the future, and I think we came to a good agreement on that.”\n\n\n\n\n', 'Oct 14, 2016'), ('\nAnalogous to their Pinetree-shaped green crest, the dorms of Pine Knoll Cluster are scattered between the looming pine trees of the Sanctuary in the private Northeastern corner of the Andover campus.\nLed by Cluster Dean David Gardner, Instructor in English, and cluster co-presidents David Kwon ’17 and Malika Dia ’17, the cluster is comprised of five dorms: Fuess, Stimson, Stevens, Stuart, and Nathan Hale.\nWith a mix of unique students from various age, race, and gender groups, Pine Knoll possesses a wide range of talents and ingenuity.\n“[My favorite part of the cluster is] the students. Pine Knollers value community, they are kind to one another, and they never cease to amaze me with their talent and creativity,” said Gardner in an email to The Phillipian.\n“I love going to performances, sporting events and club activities where I get to see Pine Knollers doing the things that they are passionate about. I look forward each week to our Wednesday munches,” he continued.\nPine Knoll serves as a second family and home to many boarding and day students.\n“Seeing Pine Knoll members in their common room, interacting with their house counselors and proctors, and at the Pine Knoll munches and events makes me really feel like I have a smaller family in addition to the larger community of Andover,” said Dia in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\xa0\nFuess House\nT. Rynne\nEvery Saturday night, Fuess residents ritually gather around the Harkness table in the common room for their weekly ranked Fuess Poker Series. These matches often last until two or three in the morning, and help unite the Fuess community. These bonding activities help new residents adjust to their lives at a rigiorous and fast-paced school.\nJames Kim ’18, a new Upper, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I think that the environment of Fuess, and all the friendly people here have made it a really easy time to acclimate to the environment overall at Andover. More specifically, with the poker games, I feel like they help improve the dorm bonding aspect a lot and allow me to be…more friendly with people that I might have not had the chance to meet otherwise.”\nHousing around 38 students, Fuess House builds a strong dorm community through numerous dorm bonding activities, said James Jusuf ’17, a proctor and returner to the dorm.\n“For a very long time, Fuess has been a dorm that has a very good community… all the dorm members don’t just know each other… but they take pride in living in Fuess and have a specific dorm culture that most of the people try to follow,” he said.\n“Bagels and Bonding” is one of major Fuess dorm bonding activities. The event involves students eating Perfecto’s bagels and travelling to the Sanctuary where they perform team-building exercises during the first weekend of school.\n“I got to speak to and interact with people that I wouldn’t necessarily have gotten to otherwise, and learn a little about who they are, and that was something that was really great in terms of bonding,” said Drake McFaul ’19, a new student to Fuess.\n“We’re also going to have the dorm brunch soon, where we all dress up and go to Samuel’s at the Andover Inn, and that’s a lot of fun,” said Jusuf.\n\xa0\nNathan Hale House\nNestled in the crook of the Sanctuary, Nathan Hale, the largest Junior girls’ dorm on campus, houses 42 Junior girls. As the only Junior dorm in the Pine Knoll cluster, Hale’s students add fresh spirit to the cluster.\n“All the Hale freshmen girls are incredibly excited and remind the upperclassmen of why we chose and love Andover,” said Malika Dia’ 17, co-cluster president of Pine Knoll, in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“Hale’s really big… so it is super high energy all the time, which is wonderful. It is a very diverse community, [and a] very uplifiting place to be,” said Miriam Feldman ’18, current prefect and former Junior at Hale, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nResidents of Hale said that the dorm’s large size gives it a distinct identity, but can become a double edged sword at times, especially when dormmates begin to form relationships with one another in the start of the school year.\nKaitlin Lim ’20, a Junior at Hale, said, “[Hale] has a large [number] of students so it’s… more separated compared to other dorms…difficult to get to know everyone, but it’s still a pretty close community.”\nTo accommodate smaller communities within the dorm, Hale split up into five different halls: upper east, lower east, upper west, lower west, and annex that bridges through the center. Each hall plans to conduct unique bonding activities, such as designing nametags and bowling, through which students will develop a closer sense of community.\n“I think the halls are really nice because it gives you a smaller community within the dorm… As a prefect, I’m…responsible for one hall…[and] we can do hall munches and hall bonding activities and [gives students a] tightknit feel even within such a huge dorm,” said Feldman.\nWhile Hale hasn’t arranged dorm bonding activities yet, the community often comes together in the dorm’s common room.\n“We have great dorm munches, and a bunch of different instruments…in the common room, so we have these jam sessions… where we put the percussion option on the piano and make weird beats and someone just freestyles – and we have cake in the fridge and we all just take that cake, it’s so amazing,” said Lim.\n\xa0\nStevens House\nLocated across the street from George Washinton Hall, Stevens is one of the largest dorms at Andover, housing 40 girls and three house counselors.\nStevens consist of singles and three-room doubles. The exterior walls of the building are made of red brick, giving a homey, cabin-like feeling. Inside, girls gather and snuggle in the furniture of both Sevens’ expansive common room, which is surrounded by tall, glass windows.\nWe have a great common room culture [in Stevens]. Whenever you walk into the dorm, you can always see girls sharing food, doing homework, and hanging out,” said Sarah Ding ’17, one of Stevens’ dorm representatives.\n“I felt right at home when I stepped into Stevens on the first day. Our dorm is not at all cliquey. Each of us has a strong relationship with our proctor, our house counselors, and each other,” said Serena Liu ’19.\nSince the dorms in the Knoll are fairly large, off-campus dorm activities are harder to manage and implement.\n“I have lived in a different cluster all my previous years. I was a [Junior] in Hale, and my roommate and I have been talking about returning to the Knoll ever since Lower year,” said Ding.\n“I clearly remember playing the man hunt freshmen year. I think we should bring that back, and overall use the Knoll lawn more,” she continued.\n\xa0\nStimson House\nTucked between the cemetery and a grove of pine trees, Stimson is home to 40 girls and three house counselors on campus.\n“I came to Stimson as a new Lower and stayed because I really like the warm dorm atmosphere… everyone is friendly and fun to talk to!” said Shoshi Wintman ’17, a proctor in Stimson.\n“You would think we aren’t as close because it’s such a big community, but everyone hangs out and cares for each other. Since our proctors also have nights on-duty, they are always here for us to talk to and share funny stories with,” said Minnie Mills ’19, Stimson’s dorm representative.\nResidents from Stimson expressed their tight relationships with proctors and house counselors.\n“This is my third year in Stimson. I have always had a sense that we are a family… We are hoping to do an applepicking activity. Logistically, it is tough because we are a big dorm, but it is definitely something we are looking forward to. On a smaller scale, I would love more arts and crafts bonding activities with the girls in the dorm,” said Karina Hernandez-Guarniz, a house counselor in Stimson.\n\xa0\nStuart House\nT. Rynne\nAlthough Stuart House is home to more than 40 students, the dorm promotes strong connection between residents by dividing the building into a system of four pods, each with their own common room.\nMyers Hogan ’19 said in an interview with The Phillipian, “There’s a close connection between the people in each pod, whether it’s Upper South, Lower South, really whichever one you live in…”\nHogan described how the dorm’s facilities promotes a sociable environment.\n“We have the dorm set up completely for social activities…board games, ping pong, TV couches, [and] six common rooms. Even if we don’t socialize all the time, we always have the opportunity to and we do have a good amount of the dorm that actually does take advantage of that,” he said.\nShu Sakamoto’17 highlighted how unlike dorms closer to the center of campus, Stuart offers a quiet and cozy atmosphere. He also noted that the dorm houses open-minded students who embrace different culture and customs.\n“[Stuart] is pretty international, and…all of us are really open minded, so maybe it’s not a super athletic dorm, but it’s still great people and it’s a really cozy place to live… Also, the fact that it is right behind Gelb, rather than in the middle of campus where it’s really loud or too far away, is great,” said Sakamoto.\nCard games can bring the dorm community together, but activities such as ping pong or board game tournaments often led to heated arguments.\n“[The games] get intense sometimes. We argue a bit, and might hate each other temporarily, [but] we all come back together afterwards,” Hogan said.\n\n', 'Oct 12, 2016'), ('\nA young Muslim man diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome faces severe islamophobia in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. This is the story of “My Name is Khan,” one of the films that has launched Indian screenwriter Shibani Bathija into the Bollywood stratosphere.\nIn an open discussion with attendees in Paul’s Room last Thursday, Bathija shared her experiences as a screenwriter working in both Hollywood and Bollywood.\n“Every film that I write, I try to write a story or have something to say that I feel strongly about… At the core of every story, there should be a reason for telling something compelling – to you, first, but hopefully it’s not so personal that it’s only compelling to you, but also to people who will actually pay good money to go out and watch that film,” said Bathija in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAlthough Bathija started her work as a screenwriter in 2001, her first film was not released until 2006. Since then, she has written four films in Bollywood, and is currently working in the United States on a new TV series to be set in America.\n“My job as a writer is sort of creating the bones of the skeleton. You have the bones, which are yours, but anything else that goes on top of it is not [yours]… You don’t have control over everything that happens to that body at the end of it. All you can do is create a really strong skeleton, so that body doesn’t crumble when it needs to move,” said Bathija.\nBathija has always considered herself an avid reader and film buff. Her prolific career in Bollywood, has given her a unique understanding of the cultural differences between the South-Eastern and Western filmmaking process.\nT. RynneIn every film she writes, Shibani Bathija works to incorporate a story that she feels passionate about.\n\n“The reason that we can read something like an Aesop’s fable, or read a manga comic, and still have people from various cultures and people from all over the world connect to that is because storytelling has a form and a human connect content, which comes down to very basic common denominators of what human beings are made up of and what we respond to,” said Bathija.\nBathija continued, “My favorite analogy to explain the Hindi film process is the difference in our styles of eating. With Indian food… all the different foods are served all together, whereas a Western meal is more like three courses… Very separate and standard, just like the three act structure in a film. Whereas in our films, just like our meals, all the flavors all go together.”\nIn her talk, Bathija acknowledged hidden deterrents to women’s careers in filmmaking, and said that some of her fellow female screenwriters have walked away from projects due to gender-based discrimination.\n“It’s very obvious that when a woman makes a point, it takes a lot more [time for people] to take it seriously. A male could come along and make that exact point in different words and suddenly everyone’s like, ‘Oh yeah, maybe he’s right.’ That sort of thing… is this sort of innate bias against a woman’s opinion,” said Bathija.\nBathija was brought to campus by IndoPak after the club’s board watched her film “My Name is Khan.” Rohan Lewis ’17 and Kabir Nagral ’19, CoPresidents of IndoPak, hope that Bathija’s talk exposed Andover students to the cultural differences and overlaps between filmmaking in India and America.\nLewis said, “She has a lot to offer to anyone who’s interested in the film industry and moviemaking in general. I also think that the cross cultural perspective that she has to offer was super important and something unique… because she is a Bollywood screenwriter, but she has worked in both industries, and I’m sure the differences and the overlap between the two would not be known to many Andover students.”\nNagral said, “There are a lot of Indians [at Andover], but she would bring a new perspective because she actually [lives in] India. Bollywood is the largest movie industry. We talk a lot about movies and stuff as well, but then to have somebody from the industry itself would be really good for the club.”\nBathija advises aspiring screenwriters and filmmakers to find and tell the story that compels them.\n“Read a lot, be patient, and forget what anybody tells you. Tell the story that moves you. If it moves you, it can move other people, but if it doesn’t move you, it’s a dead duck before it even starts,” said Bathija.\n\n', 'Oct 12, 2016'), ('\nThe bass of the music could be heard across campus this past Saturday as hordes of students streamed into the Borden Gym for this year’s first all-school dance, which was hosted by the Student Activities Office. The dance took place the Saturday night of Latin Arts Weekend. This year marked a deviation from the previous tradition of holding two separate first dances: one for incoming Juniors and another for the rest of the student body. The Phillipian conducted a series of interviews with new students to hear their opinions of the dance.\n\xa0\nChloe Brown ’19\n\n“The dance was pretty fun. I wasn’t there the whole time but the music was pretty decent. It was better than the Den dance, that’s for sure.

The gym was pretty packed, but the vibe kind of went on and off because at first no one was there, but as the upperclassmen started getting there it was a lot more fun.”\n\xa0\nRussell Lee ’20\n\n“I feel like there should be two separate dances and there should be a certain type of music played at both. I feel like they didn’t cater to a diverse group of students, they only played a certain type of music, and I feel like they should mix it up more. It’s an all-school dance. I know that the whole school didn’t come but it was still pretty cramped.”\n\xa0\nGabija Saginaite ’18\n\n“I stayed for 20 minutes because it was fun, but not that fun because of the music… Of course, [the mood of the dance] depends on if people around you are having fun, then you can join in.

Sykes Wellness Center have all been equipped with the new green roofs. The lawns each feature a ZinCo green roof system covered with plugs of sedum, a type of succulent, that will slowly cover the entirety of the building’s roof.\nBesides the potential for aesthetic enhancement by the flowering sedum plants, the roofs also function as a way to reduce water waste and air conditioning costs.\n“Green roofs keep buildings much cooler than traditional buildings, so they reduce the amount of energy that is needed to cool the building, which has an environmental benefit. They also reduce runoff by capturing stormwater, and they help in mitigating climate change by reducing carbon,” said Guerette.\nGreen roofs are capable of improving the air quality by absorbing airborne particles and carbon dioxide while releasing oxygen. The system also works as a noise barrier by reducing external noise pollution.\n“I think the inspiration was probably a little bit of both environmental and aesthetic. The first green roof was on the Addison Gallery, and there was a seating area that looked out onto a tar and gravel roof. It wasn’t really incredibly pretty to look at, and it also was in a part of campus where you can see the roof from outside, so it had multiple benefits,” said Guerette. To many students, the green roofs are a welcome addition on campus.\nTo many students, the green roofs are a welcome addition on campus.\n“Green roofs on campus are great. It’s really good for maintaining temperature inside buildings,” said Emerson. “It is [a] very useful educational tool and just kind of [a] way to contribute to the whole Greener Blue on campus. I definitely hope to see more on campus in future buildings.”\nBuildings must undergo review by a structural engineer or architect before the addition of a green roof in order to test their ability to support the heavy drainage systems. The roofs themselves require very little regular maintenance due to the ruggedness and self-sustainability of the sedum plants.\n“If you [carefully plan] and put some thought into where you put green roofs, I don’t see any disadvantages,” said Guerette.\nGuerette predicts that Andover will continue to install these living roofs to further its message of sustainability.\n“I’m not aware of any current plans to install more green roofs, but I think that the campus in general has an appreciation for sustainability and the natural world, so I think that could lead to other roofs going green around campus,” said Guerette.\n\n', 'Oct 12, 2016'), ('\nAfter 27 years of organizing fundraising campaigns that enabled Andover to adopt need-blind admissions, Patricia Diodati, Director of Information Services in the Office of Academy Resources (OAR), has retired.\nDuring her time at Andover, Diodati helped organize and manage The Andover Campaign and The Campaign for Andover, which raised a combined total of over 500 million dollars. In addition to securing need-blind admissions, the funds were also used for new buildings, including the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center.\nM. ZerbeyDiodati helped secure need-blind admissions during her time at Andover.\n“[Need-blind admission] has been the most important goal of the two campaigns. It’s to ensure that if you’re smart enough to come here, then you’re going to be able to come here – whether you can afford it or not,” said Diodati.\nDiodati, who officially retired last Friday, leaves behind a legacy of kindness and efficiency, exemplified by her annual organization of a gift collection for the Lawrence YMCA.\n“At the busiest time of our year [in the] Development Office, which is around the beginning of December through January… She would make sure that every kid got the same amount of gifts, and that they all had clothes and they all had toys… [She] made sure that those kids always had really good holidays,” said Denise Elworthy, Manager of Information Services in the OAR.\nDiodati spent her career in the Operations, Planning, and Analytics Office of the OAR, managing Andover’s alumni records and monitoring philanthropic gifts to the community. Previously, she had run her own business as a monogrammer, but Diodati decided to apply for a job at Andover after her children were accepted.\n“It’s very different working for yourself and coming to work for [others]. I think I’ve become a better person in that I care about the people who work for me. I care about a greater mission. Before, when I worked for myself, it was more for me, and now it’s for the good of [Andover],” said Diodati in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“We all have a common mission which is to educate youth from every quarter, and even though we don’t do the educating, we provide a lot of money. We raise money that allows this great institution to go on, and for all of you to have the opportunity that you have,” she continued.\nElworthy said that Diodati was among the hardest workers in the office, and would work up to fourteen hours straight to get her job done.\n“We work well together; they are so dedicated and love this place and care about this place. [They] want to do a good job and make sure everything’s done perfectly. This makes it easy to come to work and easy to do your job when you work with people who care so much about what they have to do and about this institution… I spend more time with them than I do with some of my family members,” said Diodati.\nElworthy, who has worked with Diodati for her entire tenure, says she will always admire Diodati’s attention to detail and tenacious work ethic. “She asks the right questions – always – and she asks questions until she gets to the bottom of something.

[With] anything that she does, she’s just a really good role model,” said Elworthy.\nElworthy fondly remembers the day Diodati turned 60, which happened to be the 60th year anniversary of Dunkin Donuts’ foundation. The Dean of the OAR pulled a memorable practical joke in honor of the occasion.\n“[She] and Dunkin Donuts turned 60 at the same time and her team [covered] her office in Dunkin Donuts cups because they had 60 on them. We covered the floor, her desk, her entire office. And in celebration, we kicked around Dunkin Donuts cups for a week,” said Elworthy.\nTwo of Diodati’s children attended Andover, and her grandson, Jackson Diodati ’20, is a Junior this year. Diodati considers her children’s graduation ceremonies some of her best memories at the school.\n“My favorite memory of all of my Andover experiences are when my son and my daughter graduated…it’s just a very wonderful ceremony and it’s very memorable,” said Diodati.\nAlthough she does not yet have any concrete plans for retirement, Diodati plans to spend time with family and catch up on some much deserved fun, starting with staying up late on the weekends.\n“I am going to spend a lot more time with my grandchildren, [and] with my dad who is 93.

These are the words Professor Roberto Gonzales, Ph.D., once heard from a young girl when he was following the lives of young immigrants as they grew up in the United States.\nProfessor Gonzales – an Associate Professor of Education at Harvard University and author of the new book “Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America” – spoke about the lives young immigrants in the U.S. lead during a presentation that headlined Latin Arts Weekend’s programming last Friday.\nProfessor Gonzales learned about the lives of the immigrant community during his junior year at Colorado College when he took a semester off to participate in an urban-studies program in Chicago. After graduation, he returned to Chicago where he continued to observe the struggles that undocumented youth faced on a day-to-day basis.\n“Living and working with kids and families, I got a worm’s eye view of immigration, policing, gentrification, [which] really frame the everyday world of these kids and these families. Over the years I started to notice as the kids were reaching 14-16 with their immigration status, they had problems getting jobs and driver’s licenses. A lot of our neighborhood kids were leaving school,” said Professor Gonzales.\nAfter receiving a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, Professor Gonzales continued to study the immigrant population over the course of 12 years. He closely followed the lives of 150 young adults as they grew up and attended school in the Los Angeles area. Although undocumented kids are able to attend high school, they cannot receive scholarships for college or even drive.\n“To me, the most important piece of his presentation was humanizing the undocumented lives of the 1.5 generation in the U.S.,” said Cindy Espinosa ’18, a member of Alianza Latina.\n“Considering [that] K-12 education in the U.S. is a right [for everyone,] regardless of [one’s] immigration status, it remains [as] a protected system for undocumented people. His presentation highlighted the path that most people went through during their life if they proceeded to higher education or left school after that protection was gone,” Espinosa continued.\nThis issue, however, has not been completely without reform. In 2012, President Barack Obama instituted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to receive immunity from deportation and a temporary work permit lasting up to two years.\nMekedas Belayneh ’18 said, “I found it concerning the amount of waiting many undocumented immigrants have to go through. Their rights as residents of the United States are being discussed with no urgency while they have to find a way to live without basic needs.”\nAfter surveying 2,700 undocumented adults and conducting nearly 500 personal interviews, “UnDACAmented” – one of Professor Gonzales’ most recent projects – reveals that the DACA program has been only partially successful and border control may not be the only solution.\n“Our laws treat children and adults differently, and they don’t address the kids who are growing up and becoming adults… Each year they move further and further from their parent’s culture, but paradoxically, each year brings them closer and closer to their parent’s legal circumstances,” said Professor Gonzales. “They move from inclusion to exclusion. This is really dramatic for many of the young people.”\nProfessor Gonzales’s presentation was hosted by Alianza Latina, an affinity group that represents Latin-American students and their cultures.\n“We thought his topic was really relevant considering what’s going on with the presidential campaign and all the talk about immigration. I think it’d be really helpful to just put faces to the actual people that we talk about when we talk about kicking other people out,” said Gerardo Segura ’18, a member of Alianza.\nPatricia Thompson ’19 said, “I was surprised by the hopelessness that many of the immigrants Professor Gonzales followed expressed regarding their future careers. Not having the freedom to pursue your goals in life is what creates this downward pull. Essentially, many immigrants are barred from pursuing the American dream.”\n\n', 'Oct 12, 2016'), ('\nKhalil Muhammad, Ph.D., Director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library, dissected the biased statistics and mindsets that contribute to perceived biological inferiority and systemic racism in the American justice system during his lecture in Kemper Auditorium last Thursday.\nMuhammad, a great-grandson of the founder of the Nation of Islam, focused on the implications of analyzing statistics without context to make assumptions of the African-American race as a whole. His talk was the first of the three-part “Our Divided House” series, which offers a different perspective on the current racial climate in America by tying together history and public policy.\n“Essentially, the world was chopped up into winners and losers, and you could track winners and losers by where they come from in the world,” said Muhammad during his presentation. “Africa was a great continent of darkness, as understood by etymologists and racial scientists [of the 19th century], who simply used statistics to define the worst possible categories of human suffering in Africa to prove the point.”\nCertain racial features then became associated with specific indices, and statistics became a new science of race that denotes biological inferiority, said Muhammad. He described how these statistics were steeped in white supremacy, as popular media outlets only publically shared ones that shed a more positive light on white Americans. Tiffany Chang ’19 said in an interview with The Phillipian that the most important thing she took away was that “we always need to be conscious of how supposedly objective realities actually serve to suppress minority voices. [Muhammad] talked a lot about how… what we worship as science actually just makes it harder for people’s experiences to speak for themselves. I thought that was really illuminating.”\nMuhammad also highlighted the implications of the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy that was implemented in New York City. The law allowed police officers to stop, question, and publicly search any pedestrians. “[Stop-and-frisk zones] are everywhere and are involuntary. Moreover, they impose a huge cost to your personal sense of self-worth and dignity… Being physically manhandled, questioned, and made to feel like a bad person who has hurt someone [imposes a great deal of ] personal injury. Imagine how much greater the pain when an officer takes aim and fires at an innocent or unarmed person,” said Muhammad.\nMuhammad questioned the effectiveness of this policy when looking at the larger picture of crime in America. Although statistics show that crime sharply decreased in New York City once stop-andfrisk was implemented, there was a plunge in crime rate all over the world and stop-andfrisk methods mostly targeted African Americans who lived in “high-crime areas.” Muhammad argued that these kinds of systems were meant to profile African Americans and create an unfair system in which African Americans are arrested, sentenced, and killed more frequently for less serious charges.\n“People [respond to this claim by saying], ‘Oh, how original. [Muhammad] said it’s racist.’ But the truth is that the story is in the details, and the way out of the problem is in the details… Just because something sounds familiar, doesn’t tell you enough what it looks like in the present or what it looked like in the past, or how we got from the past to the present,” said Muhammad in an interview with The Phillipian.\nZizo Bahnasy ’17 said, “People like Donald Trump bring up statistics as though they are the end all be all, as though they can tell their own story… When people like Donald Trump use stop-and-frisk as a weapon or attack on ‘the bad’ in a way that’s not supposed to happen – especially when it’s been deemed unconstitutional – it creates unnecessary fear that causes Americans to be divided.”\nAmadi Lasenberry ’17 believes that students are able to help the situation by speaking out and spreading awareness on the topic.\n“Not a lot of people have the opportunity to have these kinds of conversations, especially in high school,” said Lasenberry in an interview with The Phillipian. “We’re [going to] go our separate ways to other people who have never had that type of exposure. I think it is on us, as people who are privileged enough to learn [these] things, to go and speak about it more. It should be common knowledge.”\nMuhammad emphasized the tremendous influence students have in this movement. Apart from being an informed citizen, he also advised students to join advocacy organizations that support and strive to fix these issues.\n“Every organization needs back-office people. It’s not always about putting your body on the line… You can actually do the hard work of putting together a social-media campaign, educating people about what that particular organization wants to accomplish, how they want to behave. There are a lot of roles to play,” said Muhammad.\n\n', 'Oct 12, 2016'), ('\nRelaying his story that spans from the paths of Andover to the naval bases of Afghanistan, Dr. Jesse M. Ehrenfeld ’96, an anesthesiologist and proponent of LGBTQIA+ rights, spoke of his journey from a passive observer to a passionate advocate at Wednesday’s All School Meeting (ASM).\nIn 2014, Ehrenfeld served a tour in Kandahar, Afghanistan, as a physician in the United States Navy. While on duty, he was called to attend to airman Logan Ireland, a transgender man whose inability to come forward with his identity began Ehrenfeld’s fight for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community in the military.\n“There I was in the middle of the desert with this transgender airman in front of me, because the last place you would expect to find somebody transgender was on a deployment… If he was found out, he’d be kicked out. Usually, when there was any kind of suspicion of some- thing going on in the chain of command, he would be put on medical hold,” said Ehrenfeld in his presentation.\nEhrenfeld’s friendship with Ireland led to his involvement with the Department of Defense, where he advocated to repeal restrictions against transgender military personnel, an effort that made international headlines.\nIn 2015, Ehrenfeld also starred in a commercial on same-sex marriage, sponsored by the national bipartisan organization “Freedom to Marry.” Tennessee news stations refused to run the ad due to its subject, earning the commercial even more media attention and, once again, bringing Ehrenfeld to the center of debate over LGBTQIA+ rights.\n\xa0\nT.RYNNE/THE PHILLIPIANDr. Jesse Ehrenfeld ’96 became an advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights after hearing the story of Logan Ireland, atransgender man serving in the army.\nDuring his time at Andover, Ehrenfeld wasn’t fully aware of his sexual orientation and never really considered himself an advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community. Even after he came out in college, he never saw himself or his husband, Judd Taback, as the kind of people who march in parades and publicly fight for LGBTQIA+ rights.\n“When I thought about what an advocate was, that was the farthest thing that I saw in my- self… And yet, over the last three to five years, I’ve found myself in the middle of two fairly controversial issues that have, at their core, advocacy. One around the gay marriage debate, and two, the Department of Defense’s review of transgender service,” said Ehrenfeld in an interview with The Phillipian.\nEhrenfeld’s message of overcoming passivity for advocacy resonated with Andover students who may wish to someday champion their own causes.\n“His story of just trying to get through Andover, work hard, and not worry about the peripherals is a common mantra that a lot of students repeat to them- selves here. [I agree with] this idea of being an ‘accidental advocate,’ ” said Arthur Paleologos ’17. “All of us will end up doing advocacy at one point or another in our lives. I think there’s no reason we shouldn’t start now.”\n“Hopefully some kids took away the message that there’s more to Andover than just working hard, getting by, and graduating. That there’s a wide range of things to be an advocate about, and that is a truly remarkable thing,” Paleologos continued.\nManqoba Ngcobo ’19 said, “I thought it was a fantastic presentation. It really opened my eyes about equality and what it means to be an advocate, and it sheds some light on situations and the inequality that still exists in government and how [Ehrenfeld] was really influential in changing many, many things.”\nEhrenfeld also emphasized that everyone has the potential to lead a cause, push for a change, and make a difference in the world. He also discussed the importance of voicing opinions and standing up for what one believes in.\n“What I’ve come to realize is that all of us are advocates… All of us have a commitment to a set of things in this world that we care deeply about. For me, that started here at An- dover. It was two words: Non Sibi… Words that mean that I have a personal responsibility to lead and to serve this world.

He especially focused on categories such as Harry Potter and modern music that he considered potential areas.\nCline told his friends about the show only a day before departing to the filming site, Culver City, California. Even after winning the show, which was shot in March 2012, Cline claimed that he could not disclose the good news until the show’s airing in July.\n“The show is filmed in March, but it doesn’t air until July, so there was about six months where I knew that I’d won but because of the con- tract I’d signed with Sony Productions, I couldn’t tell anybody.

Since the start of construction on the new Snyder Athletic Center in August, many athletes like Rigazio have had to alter their paths to practice each day, an adjustment that some view as an inconvenience.\nThe construction site lies on the hillside adjacent to the Phelps Stadium, preventing students from walking on the usual pathway to sports. \nRigazio said, “When they were doing construction, we had to walk around the tennis courts, and even around the baseball fields sometimes. All the way around the back around [Smoyer Field] and then towards the back entrance to the turf.”\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, field hockey goalie Olivia Keefe ’17 said, “Some of our balls go in [the construction site] and it’s funny to watch them roll away. At the beginning though, when it was windy, the dust would blow on our faces.”\nHowever, many are excited about the new athletic center and are hopeful that the temporary inconvenience will be well worth the wait. \nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Leon Modeste, Director of Athletics and Instructor and Chair in Physical Education, said, “If it means we have to walk all the way around occasionally, that’s fine, because we know that this is really going to benefit our school for years and years to come,” said Modeste.\nJames Jusuf ’17, who runs Cross Country and Track, admitted that a new sports center would be a great improvement on the current practice center. \n“I am very happy that we are getting a new indoor track facility, considering the current condition of the Cage. The Cage lacks adequate ventilation and I sometimes have trouble breathing,” said Jusuf.\nI.HURLEY/The PhillipianThe Snyder Athletic Center construction site.\nIn order to accommodate the student athletics schedule, construction managers have designed two new pathways around the site leading to the sporting fields. Pathway A, which detours around tennis courts, leads students to the Sorota Track and Smoyer Field, while Pathway B has controlled access gates that connect to the Ice Arena and Siberia Fields.\n“I think the only big [problem] is that [students have] to walk all the way around. We haven’t had to cancel any games, we haven’t had to cancel any practices,” said Modeste.\n “The people who park up at the rink and need to walk to the soccer venue, they have to walk around so that is probably inconvenient to them…but to the student and athletic coaches [the effects] are minimal…[the construction manager] has done a great job accommodating the need of the students and they worked so hard this summer so they could have this,” he continued.\nWill Raphael ’18, a member of Andover Boys Soccer, noted that the construction had no severe impact on his team’s practice.\n“The construction of the Snyder Center hasn’t impacted the team at all. Every day we go out to the field and play just as hard whether or not there is construction in the background,” he said.\nLooking forward, as the construction transitions into the building stage, Modeste anticipates that more area will be available for student pathways. However, he mentioned that spring track teams will face the same inconveniences that fall sport athletes are experiencing now.\n“Right now all the dirt has been out there, eventually it will get smaller as they finish all the foundations. They will start up putting steel, and then [the site] will compress. Eventually the mounds will go down, and we will get more area of [the site],” Modeste said.\nPlans for the Snyder Center indicate that it will be over 100,000 square feet, and feature new basketball courts, an indoor track, and squash courts.\nManaged by Erland Construction Inc., the construction is proceeding at a steady pace.

Samuel L. Fuller, Class of 1894, donated 75,000 dollars – about one million dollars today, adjusted for inflation – for its construction. \nAlthough the Board of Trustees had previously agreed not to build on the location due to its historical significances, the Trustees deemed the field fitting for the monument in 1922. The tower replaced a flagpole that had previously stood at the location.\nThe tower’s exterior originally consisted of a steel frame encased in brick. After extensive water and rust damage made climbing up the tower too treacherous, the school began a campaign in 2005 to fund its restoration. In 2006, a 5.15-million dollar renovation updated the structure and exterior of the building, also covering the cost of cleaning and replacing some of the bells.\nT.RYNNE/The PhillipianThe Memorial Bell Tower was built in 1922 and was renovated in 2006.\n“It got to a point where it was basically too dangerous to let people in there, and they realized they had to rebuild it. And because it was a war memorial, they weren’t going to just raze the building, they were going to rebuild it. So now it’s been rebuilt from the bottom up,” said Carl Johnson, W.B. Clift Head Music Librarian, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe tower was originally intended to house only a series of chimes, used solely to alert students of the hour. In 1926, a carillon was installed instead. Unlike a standard set of bells, a carillon is played like an organ, with a musician using their hands to play a keyboard instead of pulling on ropes, allowing them to play complex melodies. \nThe carillon is powered by an Apollo computer, a machine dating back to 1980, that has the capacity of storing around 100 two-minute long songs. The Apollo computer enables the carillon to play songs automatically throughout the week. Johnson compared programming the Apollo to programming a V.C.R. or an alarm clock.\n“It’s like an alarm clock, in the way that you have to program it, so it’s very tedious. It’s on military time, and this one [time] I programmed the bells to play at 3:00 in the afternoon and I made a mistake and put 3:00 a.m. instead so I heard about that very quickly. Now, whenever I have to make any change, say to play chimes or a few tunes for an event, I have to make sure I’m playing it at 3:00 in the afternoon and not in the morning,” said Johnson.\nThe chimes can also be played manually. Initially built with 23 bells, the Andover carillon now consists of 44, many of which were cast and shipped from the Netherlands. Prior to the renovation, the chimes were operated by a carillonneur, someone who plays a carillon by manually ringing the bells. Due to safety regulations, however, the chimes can now be played from a keyboard on the bottom floor.\n“[The carillon] still has touch sensitivity, it still is musical, but it’s lacking subtlety, that’s all. An analogy might be if you connected an electronic keyboard to a piano and had some series of levers activating the hammers on the piano, but you aren’t actually in the room,” said Johnson.\nOver the years, the tower has had a multitude of carillonneurs. In 1951, Fuller founded an annual scholarship for a musically-gifted Senior “who has demonstrated high character and special musical aptitude,” according to the scholarship’s charter. Students who were granted the scholarship were also given the responsibility of playing the carillon at least five times a week for the entirety of the year. Now, however, the carillon is left largely unplayed by students. \n“It plays automatically, just like the thing you might hear on Friday afternoons, or Mondays and Tuesdays, it plays a series of notes, but that’s just like a mechanical music box,” said Johnson.\nA selection of the melodies played by the Bell Tower are available on Andover’s SoundCloud under a playlist called Memorial Bell Tower. The Memorial Bell Tower ringtone is also available for download on the Andover website for iOS and Android devices.\n\n', 'Sep 30, 2016'), ('\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor released reports last Thursday of extreme drought affecting an area that stretches from Maine to Massachusetts, including the Town of Andover. Phillips Academy is among the largest water consumers in the town.\nCommunities in and around Andover have already experienced ecological and economic effects of drought. According to the community newspaper “Wicked Local Ipswich”, towns such as Ipswich, Mass. have started to face low water reserve levels. Massachusetts’s ecology has also been impacted by the drought, as dry wetlands reduce food and drinking water sources for local wildlife.\nIn compliance with water drought regulations, Andover regularly monitors lawn irrigation systems that use the public water supply, such as the Elson Courtyard, Abbot Circle, and Shuman Admissions systems. In addition to limiting irrigation, Andover is also installing and renovating water conserving appliances on campus. The Sykes Wellness Center was also built to be 36 percent more water efficient than standard buildings.\n“We have some other measures on campus that year round help with water conservation… [For instance we] have been installing low-flow shower head fixtures into new dormitories, which save up to 60 percent of the water used with a typical shower head,” said Allison Guerette, Campus Sustainability Coordinator.\nDay student Georgia Ezell ’19, whose mother is a landscape designer, has found the drought negatively impacts her mother’s business.\n“She has all of these installations going in especially in the summer time with plants and everything, and when there are town-wide strongly encouraged water bands, it’s really difficult, like a lot of clients would back out of jobs… And also we have to be conscious about conserving water and doing normal everyday stuff besides watering plants and lawns, like showering and stuff like that,” said Ezell.\nShe continued, “I think [it is important to conserve water] for sure, I think we definitely should have the water ban be mandatory.”\nHannah Garth ’18, who lives in Andover, says her parents are worried about the drought’s effect to their garden and lawn.\n“My mom’s really into gardening, and she’s had to plan a lot about how the drought has affected the growth of her plants and vegetables, because we have a pretty extensive garden. My dad’s kind of worried about the grass. My brother can’t mow it because it’s all brown,” said Garth.\nAndover uses around 12 to 14 million gallons per day during the summer, and 6 million gallons in the winter, according to “The Andover Townsman.” Last July, the Town of Andover began Phase 2 of the Drought Management plan, which requires all major water users, such as Andover, to implement conservation measures.\n“Because [Andover] is one of the largest water users in town, we have some campus water conservation measures that will help us reduce water, and benefit the local water supply.” said Guerette.\nGuerette has also began reaching out to community members to introduce water conservation and sustainability measures. These include taking shorter showers, running full loads in the laundry machine, and turning off the tap when brushing teeth.\nThe drought in Massachusetts is part of a larger national drought that began last summer. Essex County has since faced some of the most severe drought conditions in Massachusetts, with levels reaching D3-D4 (extreme to exceptional drought), since August.\nGuerette believes it is just as important for students to be conscious of saving water at Andover as they are outside of campus. She hopes that more students will engage in the conservation of\n“We’re just starting to really engage in sustainability here, and we would love to hear the ideas that students have about conserving water or natural resources on campus, so we are really open in hearing what students have to say,” said Guerette.\n\n', 'Sep 30, 2016'), ('\nPhillips Academy SmugmugPhoto illustration\n\nData and descriptions available online at nonsibipress.org\nEarly this September, The Phillipian, vol. CXXXIX, and The Exonian, vol. CXXXVIII, collaborated to conduct the first-ever survey of all incoming freshmen at Andover and Exeter. The survey, inspired by the annual “Freshman Survey” distributed by “The Harvard Crimson” and “The Yale Daily News,” consists of 36 questions and is divided into five main topics: general information, middle school, Andover/Exeter, and perceptions about the two institutions academically, socially, and athletically.\nOf the 221 Juniors (freshmen at Andover) who received the survey, The Phillipian received 169 complete responses – 76.5 percent of the Class of 2020. Of the 186 Preps (freshmen at Exeter) who received the survey, “The Exonian” received 157 complete responses – 84.4 percent of students polled. In the interest of accurately reporting the results of the two surveys, all of the data is presented on a percentage basis and all graphs can be toggled to show individual results from each school.\nWe thank the students at Andover and Exeter for their willingness to provide information about themselves and to share their experiences, and we are looking forward to future collaborations between The Phillipian and “The Exonian” under a joint “Non Sibi Press” venture.\n\n', 'Sep 30, 2016'), ('\nThe frozen yogurt machine on the second floor of Paresky Commons sat untouched for the first time on Tuesday as the bustling crowd of students rushed into line for lunch. A popular choice for many students, this will be the first year that fro-yo will only be available to students during Monday, Wednesday, and Friday lunch periods. Another student favorite, Perfecto’s bagels, have also been restricted to these days, sparking controversy within the student body on Andover’s decision to change its meal plan.\n“Just the restriction itself is kind of disappointing to me. I like seeing that ice cream machine open everyday, it’s just a nice thing to have on campus. But if you only have it three days a week, it kind of [defeats] the purpose [of having ice cream],” said Logan McLennan ’19. \nMaca Artunduaga ’18 said, “[I agree with the school’s healthy initiatives], but I do think that they can’t just force healthiness on us. They should make it available for those who want it… There are a lot of kids, and we’re going to spend four years of our lives here. If we’re going to be here and we can only eat certain things, that’s not going to make the experience as much fun as it could be.” \nIn place of frozen yogurt, Paresky Commons has introduced “Chloe’s Frozen Fruit,” located next to the sorbet machine on the first floor. \nChloe’s Frozen Fruit consists of frozen fruit, sugar, and ice. New homemade energy bars made out of oats and dried fruit have also replaced Perfecto’s bagels. Agatha Kip, Nutrition Counselor and Sports Dietitian, says these replacements are a response to the significant part of the student body that has dietary restrictions.\n“[The energy bar] is more dense with nutrients than the bagel. And also the bagels were [made of flour]. Many students are gluten-intolerant. I love that the homemade energy bars are dense with nutrients, but yeah, I suppose on some level, everything we do is reflecting health and wellness, but usually, there’s many more reasons [for changing the menu],” said Kip in an interview with The Phillipian. \nFrozen yogurt is a dairy-based product, limiting options for lactose-intolerant students. Paresky Commons currently offers soy- and rice-based milk that also cater to lactose-intolerance and new dairy-free smoothies are being implemented to further accommodate those students.\nParesky Commons also has been trying to control traffic flow in lines before the new 4×5 schedule is implemented next year.\n“Given that we’re definitely moving towards a different schedule, that’s going to be a big change. So I don’t want the [Paresky Commons] to be another big change, I want to smooth out everything as much as we can before then, so that the only change is the schedule,” said Kip.\nKip also emphasized the importance of “grab-and-go” snacks due to the time-sensitive lifestyles of many Andover students. She has heard that students often don’t eat substantial meals in order to attend extra-curricular activities at night, and many use the time between classes to grab a snack at Commons.\nMartha Gao ’17 said, “It was really nice [to have bagels this morning] because I could just grab one and go to English and be satisfied. But sometimes, when there are no bagels, I can’t find anything else to eat quickly.”\nStudents are encouraged to input their ideas for new improvements at Paresky Commons. The white board next to the sorbet machine is an active area for new flavor ideas.\n“In a perfect world, we would have [frozen yogurt and bagels] all the time, but we just can’t. We can’t offer every single thing all the time. And so, we’re trying to tweak everything. I’ll be very interested to hear about students and what they would love to have more of… And I think it would be better if we thought of it together.

With the parking lot by the varsity tennis courts closed due to the Snyder Center construction, day students have found it difficult to find convenient parking spots during school hours.\nDay students are permitted to park in the Graves Hall parking lot or in the East Stuart Hall lot facing Highland Avenue before 3:00 p.m. on school days. After 3:00 p.m., day students are permitted to park wherever they would like. Since the start of this year, 34 day students have registered their cars. \nPAPS issues a map detailing the parking options around campus when students register their cars. Some students, however, who did not receive maps were unsure of where they could and could not park, which resulted in their vehicle being ticketed. Students who receive a ticket must pay a fine of ten dollars. \nBrett Sawka ’17 said in an interview with The Phillipian, “[PAPS was] supposed to give me a map of where to park, and they did not when they registered my car… I was unclear of where to park because PAPS themselves did not say where I could.” \nAnushree Gupta ’18 said that she received a ticket, despite having parked at a designated spot. \n“I got a false parking ticket even though I was parked on the side of the lot that day students are allowed to park on… I went to PAPS that day, and they said that the person [that] needed to clear the ticket was not there,” she said. \nThomas Conlon, Director of PAPS, dismissed the charges of those who chose to challenge their citations, blaming a potential mistake.\n“On that [specific incident] I had a few students come in and they said they were on the proper side, and I took their word for it, so I just took their tickets and ripped them up so there was no consequences on their part. It could have been oversight,” said Conlon.\nMeanwhile, PAPS has attempted to penalize unregistered student drivers who avoid identification and park outside the student lots. Starting this year, students are required to register their cars before they can receive the sticker for their BlueCard that shows they are permitted to transport boarding students. \n“There has [been an issue with students not registering their cars]. I think [students not registering their cars] has picked up more, primarily because students probably don’t want to be identified as students, and park where they want to park. But if you go by the Blue Book, you’re supposed to be registered,” said Conlon.\nEmma Chatson ’18 and Gupta have said they have noticed potential violations by unregistered parking drivers. \n“I’ve only needed to park at Graves once, and… there weren’t a lot of spaces filled there. I would assume that the rest of those day students who aren’t parking at Graves or [Stuart] aren’t registered and are parking on the street next to the [Schuman] Admission Center or maybe even in the gym lot,” said Chatson.\nGupta believes students are not motivated to register their cars because she finds that only cars with registration stickers receive tickets.\n“All the cars with registration stickers on that side of the lot had tickets. If they didn’t have the stickers they wouldn’t have gotten any tickets. It encourages day students not to register their cars,” she said.\nStudents also complained about the lack of convenient parking spots. The Stuart lot, with its convenient proximity to campus, often fills before 7:30 a.m., forcing students to make the walk from Graves to campus. \nChatson said, “Graves is such an inconvenient parking space for day students because it takes ten minutes to walk from Graves to Commons, especially in morning commute traffic when people aren’t willing to stop for students who are crossing the street.” \n“It’s totally out of the way of many students’ commitments, it’s just very frustrating. It’s also very competitive trying to get one of those [Stuart] parking spaces. You have to show up [to park] really early,” she continued.\nAlthough there has yet been a day this year where both the Stuart and Graves parking lots were full according to PAPS, Sawka worries about finding available parking once more students begin driving to campus. \n“The Graves lot is usually fine, but this year I worry that once more Uppers get their licenses there might be a problem because we lost a lot [of parking spaces] this year to construction. I’d say that we have a valid reason to have more spots [available],” he said.\nIn the future, day students hope to see more convenient parking locations around campus to encourage car registration, as well as more consistency among PAPS officers to avoid more incorrectly issued tickets. \nConlon, however, says that the installation of new student parking lots is unlikely within the next few years. Even if a parking lot is built, it may not be in a more convenient location for students.\n“The Graves lot…[is] an easier location to get to GW [for] a day student going to [their] lockers…Over the years, students have talked about trying to get a specific student parking area… which I think is a good idea, but at the same time, depending on where the administration feels student parking could be, it may not be appropriate to where they’d like to be. You’d just be on another section of campus,” said Conlon.\n\n', 'Sep 30, 2016'), ('\nT.RYNNE/The Phillipian\nYoutube Sensation Speaks\xa0About\xa0Sexual Assault Prevention\nOpening with a video depicting examples of the injustices of rape culture, sex educator and video-blogger Laci Green led a presentation on how to combat sexual violence and promote gender equity on campus at this week’s All-School Meeting (ASM).\nGreen, who has over 1.5 million YouTube subscribers and was recently named one of the “30 Most Influential People on the Internet in 2016” by “Time Magazine,” was invited to campus by the Brace Advisory Board.\n“One of the main focuses of the Brace Student Advisory Board is to deconstruct rape culture… We had the [Mentors in Violence Prevention] (MVP) program last year, [which] we considered a success, so we wanted to take that one step further and invite someone… who is a big influence on a lot of young people to come, speak on that subject and help ease our transition into [having] more discussion about it,” said Larson Tolo ’18, a student speaker at ASM and member of the Brace Advisory Board, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nZoë Sottile ’17 and Bailey Colón ’18, members of the Brace Advisory Board, introduced Green, acknowledging her videos’ ability to make information that might have previously been inaccessible to young viewers easy to understand through a combination of pop culture and personal examples.\n“In a world where women are often shamed as sluts for having sexual desires of their own, [Green’s] work embraces female sexuality. For me, after years of inadequate health classes, [her YouTube series] ‘Sex+’ helped me learn to love myself and my body,” said Sottile during ASM.\nMany students found Green’s presentation to be a necessary addition to Andover’s continued discussion on healthy relationships.\n“I thought [the presentation] was very necessary because rape culture is very serious among boarding schools, colleges, and places where people live at school. It’s necessary to have [talks about rape culture] at the beginning of the school year,” said Ugo Ogonuwe ’20.\n“It was a very interesting talk. I really appreciated the fact that she brought up issues of sexual assault against males, which is an issue that’s often glossed over or trivialized,” said Alex Davenport ’17.\nGreen stayed on campus after ASM to answer student questions in Susie’s and give a presentation to faculty on safe sex and healthy relationships in Tang Theatre.

That includes things like sexual orientation, gender identity, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism. Anything that has an intersection with how we experience our sexuality, I’ve talked about it.\nWhy did you decide to create YouTube videos?\n[I started my channel] in 2008. [I decided to make videos] because I needed a community. I needed a place and people to talk to. I was feeling really alienated and isolated in my own community, and the Internet provided a place for me to find people to talk about it.\nWhat is your opinion on the situation of sexual misconduct on high-school campuses like [Andover]?\nGenerally, I think it’s an issue that we need to be talking about and it’s an issue that we need to be proactive about. That includes students and staff, society, and parents. It’s a conversation that everyone needs to be having. We need to address it to make education safe and equitable so that everyone has an equal opportunity to get an education and to strive in the world.\nWhy did you decide to come to Andover?\n[The Brace Advisory Board] invited me to come here, but I was particularly interested [in Andover] because it’s a high school, and because all the laws around Sex Ed in public schools…there aren’t a ton of schools that I can actually speak at. It’s always really exciting when I get the opportunity to talk to people who are not in college yet because I think these conversations should start earlier.\nWhat is the big idea you want student to take away from your ASM talk?\nThe big idea that I would like them to take away is that each of us have power, even though it doesn’t feel like it sometimes. We do have power to end this issue, and I want everyone to know that there are ways [to do so]. I hope that I’ve offered some ideas of ways to engage with this issue. Because if every single person in the world engaged in this issue in some way, it would stop.

[I chose] Andover specifically because the students were incredible… when I visited the faculty and students were very welcoming, and I think the school really tries to continually progress.\nWhat do you look forward to in and outside the classroom?\nIn my classes, I am definitely looking forward to getting to know the students better and getting to learn from them just as much as they, hopefully, do from me. Outside the classroom, [I hope to] really [see] what the Andover community is like, and [see] where I can fit in and learn from the people.\nAlison Hamlin, Chemistry\nIs there anything specific that drew you to Andover?\nOne of my best friends went here actually, and so I’d always known about her experience. I was also looking at different independent schools that have similar fellow programs. One of the things that really stuck out to me about Andover was their dedication to equity and inclusion, and I think there are a lot of conversations happening on this campus that aren’t happening elsewhere. That got me really excited and that was the type of community I wanted to be part of.\nWhat is it that makes you passionate about chemistry?\nWhen I started college, I went in as a chemical engineering major. I had enjoyed A.P. Chemistry in high school and had a really great teacher and I think that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. But then I took organic chemistry my freshman year [in college] in addition to [an introductory] chemical engineering class and the engineering class was way too much math and not enough chemistry, and the organic chemistry class I really loved.\nIan Wollman,\xa0Chinese\nWhat got you interested in pursuing a career related to Chinese?\nActually, I went here [as a student] and I went to one of those sample classes that all new students go to if they want to check out the more nontraditional stuff, and so I took a Chinese sample class… I guess I was just hooked from that class, pretty much, from day one. I just think it’s a really cool language.\nSo you were a student here– is there something specific about Andover that drew you back?\nI grew up in [the town of] Andover as well, and the school has always been a big part of the town community. That being said, it’s always been a bit of a community in and of itself, and I really appreciate stuff like what CAMD does to build that sense of community.\nJose Peralta, Biology\nWhat got you interested in teaching or being involved in biology?\nGrowing up, I thought that I was going to pursue a career in medicine, but I think that the longer I stayed in school, especially being the first in my family to graduate from college, I learned that I could help students, especially those who share a similar story to mine –\nbeing first-generation college students and sort of aspiring to be something in life.\nWhat was it specifically that brought you to Andover?\nBeing a boarding school, Andover is causing a ripple effect in education, especially in the private sector, by implementing policies like the need-blind admissions policy, and I think that it’s a great opportunity for widening the sort of aisle of opportunity for any student from here in the U.S. to abroad, and I think that’s something I hope other schools will eventually follow.\nTravis Magaluk, Physics\nWhat inspired you to be involved in and teach physics?\nI am very interested in the way things work and how things work in everyday life. I studied engineering in college and I’ve always been interested in just applying physics to everyday life. I’m a big climber and I’m passionate about teaching, [so] I kind of wanted to combine those two passions.\nIs there anything special to Andover that you think has really affected your experience as of now?\nI think the location is awesome! I’ve really been enjoying the scenery and how it reminds me of my home in Michigan. It’s very different from the mountainous West. And everyone’s just been so nice and so kind and I think that’s been a great part of it so far, and the students have been great.\nRyan Glenn, Physics\nWhat inspired you to teach physics? What do you love about it?\nI had a really great physics teacher back in high school. I went to Kent School, down in Connecticut, so that’s one of the things that brought me back to the boarding school experience… I had a really great physics teacher [who] really got me interested in the world around us and how we can understand and model it.\nWhat brought you to Andover?\nWell, it was the prep-school experience. I spent three years at boarding school and it was a fantastic time. I really loved having all the students, faculty, you know everyone gets really engaged in the community.

They were then placed in visible areas around campus\xa0 including the dorms, pathways, and the library.\n“The general idea is that… kind messages are making their way around campus,” said Julia Howard, fellow in Office of Community Engagement, in an interview with The Phillipian. \n“Hopefully someone who is stressed about studying for a test might come across on campus—whether in a random place or someone had intentionally placed it in their dorm room—a little ‘you can do it’ rock [that gives] the person a boost,” Howard continued.\nStudent Coordinator William Kim ’18 pointed out that a small amount of kindness can lead to greater outcomes.\n“The point of the project was to spread a little bit of kindness to other people’s lives… to encourage them [and] give them something to look forward to… I think having that little bit of kindness can be an impactful thing,” said Kim in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe Kindness Rock Project itself has already been taking place across the country. It was first introduced to Andover by Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of the Office of Community Engagement, who saw the project in Newburyport, Massachusetts over the past summer.\nAfter deciding to adopt the project, coordinators used the patio of the library as a starting point for their rock garden.\n“We were pretty amazed to see [that] within a day, all the rocks were gone, which also means that people picked up rocks either for themselves or their friends,” said Howard.\nEver since, the kindness rocks have been spreading across campus in the hands of students and faculty and also spotted in unanticipated places like the cross country course.\n“I took two or three [rocks] and placed them at some of the teacher’s houses, and they were very excited… Somebody told me yesterday that they were doing cross country, and they saw a rock. They were like ‘Did you place a rock there? It made my day!’” said Emilie Cliquet, Program Assistant of the Office of Community Engagement, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nStudents and faculty can add their own rocks to the project by visiting the Dean of Students Office or the Community Engagement Office. Howard hopes to create more locations that serve as “kindness rock-making stations” on campus.\nHoward anticipates that student-driven initiatives will contribute in the future spread and expansion of the project.\n“The Community Engagement Office introduced this project to the campus… but we really want the students to be the ones who carry and continue the project.

Installed by Office of Physical Plant (O.P.P.) plumbers, the new Quantum Speed Queen laundry machines offer students a wider variety of wash cycles and heat selections than their older counterparts.\nOne of the biggest changes resulting from the new machines was the introduction of laundry cards, which students can use to pay for their laundry after depositing money onto the reloadable card. Using the new machines costs slightly more money than the previous models; a spin in the washer and the dryer costs 3.75 dollars altogether, unlike the previous machines that cost 2.50 dollars. The cards are priced at 5.00 dollars, which does not count towards money that can be used for the laundry machines.\nDea Barreto Lagesse ’18 said, “Although the prices have gone up to use the washing machines, I do feel that the card is more effective than trying to get quarters at Bank of America or the Den.”\n“I prefer the card, definitely, but it might be a bit of a hassle to go all the way to student activities just to refill the card. Sometimes you can’t find enough quarters, but you can always just find the card. In my opinion, it’s better,” said Jihoun Im ’17.\nThe outgoing laundry machines were approaching the end of their lifecycle, and required frequent service and maintenance by O.P.P. The new washers are also equipped with more durable stainless steel washtubs, which won’t rust or chip.\n“The washing machines are more effective, and they take a lot less time than the old ones. Before, with the old machines in my dorm, Hearsey House…\xa0 it was time consuming, especially when you had to switch clothes from the two.

As Sunday marked the 15th anniversary of the events of September 11, 2001, members of the Andover community paused to reflect on the tremendous tragedy of that day.\nReverend Anne Gardner, Director of Spiritual and Religious Life, organized tributes around campus in order to observe this anniversary, including the tolling of the bells, the black ribbons provided in Paresky Commons, and flags which flew at half-mast on campus. In addition, names of victims previously submitted by students, faculty, and staff, including the names of two alumni, Todd Isaac ’90 and Stacy Sanders ’94, were displayed in Paresky. \n“I think from a pastoral perspective, there are many people on this campus who are far too young to remember September 11; they don’t have a direct personal experience of that day and [then] there are many, many people on the other end of the stick who not only remember that day quite well, but actually because of the location of the school and because Flight 11 left from Boston, have an immediate connection with people that lost their lives,” said Gardner in an interview with The Phillipian.\nServing as a symbol of mourning for those killed on 9/11, black ribbons were provided for community members as a visual reminder of the tragedy. \n“I made [the ribbons] available on Sunday here in Paresky just again as a visual reminder that this day is meaningful, that it was a day of great grief and tragedy and that you’re holding that in your heart, even if it doesn’t directly affect you,” said Gardner. \nDuring the time of the tenth anniversary of 9/11, Gardner shared a conversation with then Associate Head of School Rebecca Sykes about whether the commemoration had run its course. \n“After the tenth anniversary, we had one year where we didn’t have [any commemoration], just to sort of see how that would feel, and if there was enough angst in the community to want to resurrect something. We heard from a few people, but frankly, a few people was enough to convince me to start doing it again. [Head of School John] Palfrey absolutely supported it and wanted it and wants all of these secular moments to be commemorated in some way and has asked me to be able to craft those things,” said Gardner.\nIn addition to 9/11, Gardner organizes tributes for Memorial Day and Veteran’s Day. \n“For Memorial Day, for Veteran’s Day, for September 11, these are all moments in our collective history where we pause for whatever time and remember those events. So I’m happy to continue doing something, and each year, it’s taken on a slightly different tone based on when the holiday falls and how it matches up with the school’s calendar,” said Gardner.\nGardner is the first Director of Spiritual and Religious Life at Andover, as the position was initiated when she first arrived on campus in 2008. \n“My job is to oversee the chapel at large and particularly to develop programming that speaks to the religious or spiritual lives of students across all different types of faith traditions, including people who are not religious or who have not grown up in a particular faith tradition. And to try to develop programming that speaks to what it means to have an interior life, what it means to think about questions of what kind of person you are going to become, and how you make the choices in your life,” said Gardner.\nGardner does not have any specific hopes for future generations in regard to 9/11, except that they will find a way to craft their own vision on what that day means to them. \n“I’m actually curious to see, as the years go on, what the long lense of history will project for September 11. I know it has a particular piece in my lifespan, but I’ll be interested to see what happens with all of you,” said Gardner.\n\n', 'Sep 16, 2016'), ('\nJean St. Pierre, a Faculty Emerita in English and Theatre of both Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy, passed away on August 10 in her hometown of Harwich Port, Mass. at the age of 79.\nSt. Pierre retired in 2004 after a career spanning 41 years. She began teaching English at Abbot Academy in 1963, where she became the Chair in English in 1971. After Abbot’s merger with Phillips Academy, she was one of the few Abbot faculty who remained on staff. In the years after, St. Pierre would go on to lead efforts for gender equality in the classroom.\nMary Fulton, Instructor in English, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “When [St. Pierre] was a kid growing up in Lowell, her family used to go for a Sunday afternoon drive and they often drove by the gates of Abbot and she used to say, ‘someday I would like to be here.’ She never got to go there as a student, but it was her first teaching job in 1963. She had a very successful teaching career and she was part of that minority of women that started teaching here after the school went co-ed.”\nAfter ten years of teaching at Andover, St. Pierre joined the newly formed Co-Educational Committee tasked with analyzing the effectiveness of the merger.\nDuring her years as Chair in English, St. Pierre championed efforts to renovate Bulfinch Hall. She also played a crucial role in instituting a requirement that Uppers must take a full year of English, which remains in place today. St. Pierre also directed an English elective titled “Man and God,” which was renowned for the discussion surrounding the human and the superhuman.\nFulton said, “She made every student feel really valued; everybody’s opinion was important to her. She was also quite an actress. She was quite funny and lively.”\nSt. Pierre’s love of the theater inspired her to support young Phillips Academy actors. Under her supervision, the school repurposed the lecture halls in George Washington Hall to create Steinbach and Tang Theatres.\nKevin Heelan, Instructor in Theatre, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Every rehearsal that we did, even the one’s that were fraught with all kinds of tension because they weren’t going well, there were always moments where her warmth and her sensitivity were always in evidence, and she was about the soul.”\nSt. Pierre, in 1976, developed a student exchange program between Andover’s theater students and students from Manchester, England. St. Pierre accompanied ten students to England to give a series of performances.\nFulton said, “She was just a person who was just very smart, but also very kind and very genuine, and you just remember the good feelings you have about her. She made people very happy, if you had a problem you could talk to her, and she really counseled many people. She was an extraordinarily good department chair because she took care of all the details a department chair has to take care of, but also [was] just so supportive of everybody.”\nThe outdoor St. Pierre Classroom was dedicated to St. Pierre’s contributions to the community. It was inaugurated in 2013 and stands today outside of Bulfinch Hall. The classroom is formed of granite benches positioned in a circle.\n“People thought that it was a very original thing, an outdoor classroom, because she had been a very original person,” said Fulton. “She had dealt a great deal with drama, as well as English, and it only seemed fitting that she would have this beautiful place outside.”\nSt. Pierre earned a B.A. degree at Wheaton College and later earned a Master’s degree at Columbia University. In 1974, St. Pierre spent a sabbatical year teaching English at School Year Abroad in France.\n“[St. Pierre] was a remarkable individual, I think she was the most consequential educator, certainly in my time, that [Phillips Academy] has seen. She was a very kind person, very smart, and more complex, I think, than people realize. She was quintessentially Irish, and she was one of my favorite people I have ever known,” said Heelan.\nSt. Pierre is survived by her sister, Mary Baroni, her brother-in-law Daniel Baroni, and numerous nephews and godchildren. A memorial will be held in her honor at Cochran Chapel on November 5.\n\n', 'Sep 16, 2016'), ('\nAfter half a year of renovation, the southern wing of the former Isham Medical Center has been converted into a spacious girls dorm, known simply as West.\nThe dorm houses 29 girls ranging from Lowers to Seniors. Perpendicularly attached to Isham Dorm, West consists primarily of single rooms and two double rooms.\nEliza Bienstock ’18 was one of the few students placed into West through Andover’s annual housing lottery.\n“The rooms are really nice. It’s all very clean. There’s a handicap shower which is really nice. There’s an upstairs common room which has giant glass windows. There are also little study spaces with each pod” said Bienstock.\nIn addition to the interior, the exterior of the building received modifications as well. Lining the entrance, new paving stones are surrounded by a fresh layer of green sod. Bright sunlight illuminates the large double-layered roof of the building as it slopes downward, merging into the classic red brick finish characteristic of many dorms on campus. New copper gutters outline the corners of the building on all sides. At the end of the wing, nearest the softball field, a white sun room fitted with dozens of tiny windows complements the warmer exterior across the rest of the building.\nHeidi Wall, Instructor in Mathematics and resident house counselor in West said, “We are very happy to be living in West this year and so glad that the girls have a beautiful new space in which to live and work. It is very cheery and bright, with good sunlight and bright, happy colors.”\nWall continued, “Some of the best features of the new dorm are the sitting areas on the first and second floor where the girls can study or hang out. White boards allow the girls to work collaboratively on homework problems or leave fun notes for each other. There are even mini-fridges for the convenience of the girls as well.”\nAs a new dorm, this will be the first year that any students will be experiencing the space. Bienstock is grateful to have been placed in West.\n“It’s a new dorm so I think our proctors and prefects and house counselors are working really hard to try to set a good atmosphere because this group hasn’t been together yet. It’s kind of a new group of people. But everyone’s making a big effort to be nice and respectful and I think it will be a really fun year. I feel very lucky,” said Bienstock.\nResident in West, Karolina Buchajska ’18, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “The dorm is absolutely beautiful. The study spaces and common rooms are not only warm, but everything and everyone makes you feel welcome. All the house counselors are very caring and are always there if you need them. The proctors and prefects are nothing but supportive and radiating with kindness. I definitely think it was worth the move. All the girls are incredibly nice and thoughtful.”\nWest will not be the only dorm to receive a touch-up. Many of the girls now residing in the dorm originally lived in Bancroft, another girls’ dorm located in West Quad North that is scheduled for renovation later this year.\n\n', 'Sep 16, 2016'), ('\nWith shouts and drums echoing through the rafters of Cochran Chapel, Seniors clad in navy triumphantly marched down the chapel aisle chanting “17,” welcoming students to the first All-School Meeting (ASM) of the 2016-2017 year.\nStudents speaking at ASM included Co-Presidents Arthur Paleologos ’17 and Madison Pettaway ’17, as well as international student speakers, Emir Sahin ’17 and Anastasia Nikolaeva ’20. The students shared remarks regarding the start of the school year.\xa0\nPettaway encouraged students to be ambitious while simultaneously retaining the ability to live in and enjoy the present moment.\xa0\n“During your time at Andover… it can be tempting to focus on your future destination, whether that will be the next dorm, or future college, or potential leadership position. While we encourage all of you to work towards your goals, we also challenge you to do that while we are being in the present, in every second, minute, and hour of today,” said Pettaway.\nNikolaeva articulated the importance and responsibility of maintaining an inclusive community at Andover.\n“Andover prides itself on its motto, Non Sibi, which means not for self, and while [this] saying often makes you think of serving other communities…\xa0 it begins here, in our student community. I think this starts with the small things that we could do for one another each day, and to think not only of ourselves, but of our classmates. And to create a community in which we all feel included,” said Nikolaeva.\nShe continued, “Here [at Andover] we both have an opportunity and responsibility. We have an opportunity to serve and lead, and to take time to get to know our classmates and to learn from them and to teach them about ourselves too… But ultimately it’s the people that make the space come alive, and I think it’s our responsibility to be there for one another.”\nAmid spontaneous cheering by Seniors, Head of School John Palfrey opened his speech by encouraging students to consider how they will leave their mark in the community.\xa0\n“Something that I think about enormously in this job [as Head of School] and particularly think about during this time of year is: What are the footsteps that I wish to leave as the Head of School? I am completely aware that I am the 15th Head of School, 14 have gone before, and many will go after. Whenever we go through a place like this, we leave our mark – little, gentle indentations. For me, I see it most acutely in the steps of the first and second floors of Paresky… think [about] every step you make here and how you would like it to be left,” said Palfrey during ASM. \nAs the presidential election in November nears, Palfrey shared some remarks regarding the political discourse that has surrounded the race. \n“This is a special year for lots of reasons, but one is that it is an election year, if you have not noticed in the United States of America, it’s a doozy of an election year. To my mind, this election year throws down the honor of these… two parties,” said Palfrey.\nPalfrey advised students to recognize and appreciate the multitude of political opinions held by community members. \n“This is a community, intentionally diverse, which truly is academically brilliant and wonderful and caring… I want us to do better than those who are politically endowed in the political discourse… [I want you] to lay the mark in favor of respect and stability, seriousness of purpose, openness to new ideas, thinking about perspectives different than our own, [and] actually listening to one another, so that at the end of the year, I believe that we can do that. I believe that this is the place,” said Palfrey.\n\n', 'Sep 16, 2016'), ('\nRevisions made to the Blue Book over the summer were introduced to students during their respective cluster meetings last Thursday. The major revisions focus on addressing sexual misconduct on campus, and they are a continuation of the Affirmative Consent Policy that was added to the Blue Book last year. Another major revision adds tobacco products to the Sanctuary policy.\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, emphasized the importance of reading the contents of the revised Blue Book, especially noting that sexual misconduct is now explicitly stated as a major offense.\n“The Affirmative Consent Policy has not changed… sexual misconduct has always been considered a major offense under a larger umbrella of harassment… but we just wanted to be as explicit as we could with our [students] so that it will help inform their decision-making and their behavior,” said Elliott in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe term “sexual misconduct” was also specifically defined as any act of unwanted sexual contact (both with or without force), non-consensual sexual penetration (with or without force), sexual intimidation, sexual exploitation, and relationship violence.\nElliott noted that students and faculty in the previous school year, as well as in lieu of recent investigations regarding sexual misconduct in boarding schools, have helped to prompt these changes.\n“I think the larger cultural focus in this area, for sure the federal government’s investigation into a number of different abuses on college campuses [and] press coverage of activities on college campuses [have] focused all of our attention in this area. But… student advocates have [also] pushed us,” said Elliott.\nChanges were also implemented to align policies on sexual misconduct in the Blue Book with the ones noted in the Faculty and Staff Handbook.\n“We have repeatedly asked students to read this section, we’ve asked faculty and staff members to read this section, we have [discussed it] in cluster meetings, we will talk about it in dorm meetings, and advising groups. ‘I didn’t know’ will never be an okay excuse for student behaviors. We really want to make sure [students] know about it, and we want to make sure we offer opportunities if [students] have questions,” said Elliott.\nAll student offenses of sexual misconduct, harassment, discrimination, and hazing and bullying are handled by the Community Conduct Council (C.C.C.).\n“[The C.C.C.] is largely an investigative group, and we write reports [about the incident] and make recommendations [to the Disciplinary Committee]… it makes total sense to have clearer guidelines,” said Marisela Ramos, Instructor in History and a member of the C.C.C.\nThe Brace Center for Gender Studies also plans to coordinate a number of events this year to address the topics of healthy relationships, sexual assault, and gender-based violence. \nLaci Green, a sex educator, activist, and host of a YouTube channel on sexual education with one million subscribers, will also be coming to Andover and speaking at All-School Meeting on these topics this year. Green will hold a lunch discussion with students and hold workshops for student leaders and faculty.\n“She’s fantastic… she’s young, dynamic, and super frank and open. [She] has a very powerful message, and a lot of the students here are familiar with her and her work. So we think it’s going to be a really great way to kick off the school year with this kind of program,” said Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nStephanie Gilmore, a feminist activist and professor in gender studies, is another speaker scheduled to come to campus during the first weekend of October and lead various workshops.\nIn addition, Andover will again offer a Mentors in Violence Prevention program to 50 Lowers. In the span of seven 90-minute sessions, participants will learn about ways to raise awareness of sexual violence, discuss the importance of consent, and explore the potential roles of bystanders.\n“Andover is trying to do everything we can to promote healthy decision making… We want [students] to enter into any dynamic with another person from a place of respect and thoughtfulness. The data we’ve collected on our campus and other campuses around sexual assault are terrifying, and they absolutely make it impossible for kids to learn well and to thrive. We want to make sure that [students] know that we are hearing them when they talk to us about their concerns,” said Elliott.\nRevisions on sexual misconduct can be found on pages 9-19 of the Blue Book, and on page 39 it is explicitly stated that sexual misconduct is considered a major offense. Policy regarding the inclusion of tobacco in the Sanctuary policy can be found on page 7.\n\n', 'Sep 16, 2016'), ('\nIndependent investigators hired by Andover have concluded that five cases of sexual misconduct were perpetrated by faculty members during the 1970s and 1980s, according to a letter emailed to the extended Andover community by Head of School John Palfrey on August 30. \nThe letter reported five faculty members had engaged in sexual misconduct with students during those decades, and it disclosed the investigative results of three of the five cases. \nPalfrey’s letter stated that the investigation was conducted by the Sanghavi Law Office, a firm hired by Andover in the spring. \nAfter following up with all concerns and reports of sexual misconduct, Sanghavi Law Office concluded that former faculty members H. Schuyler Royce and Stephen Wicks, as well as former writer-in-residence Alexander Theroux, had engaged in sexual misconduct with students at Andover. The letter named one incident each for Theroux and Wicks and multiple incidents for Royce. \nRoyce passed away in 1991, and Theroux and Wicks have since retired. Theroux has denied the claims. \nIn his letter, Palfrey wrote that “In accordance with school policy,” both Theroux and Wicks have “been barred from campus and from Andover events.” \nMr. Wicks’s emeritus status has also been revoked.\nLast spring, Mr. Palfrey wrote to the community, addressing sexual misconduct at independent schools and requesting that anyone with information about misconduct report it to the school. All reported concerns about misconduct were investigated by Sanghavi Law Office. \nAccording to its website, lawyers at Sanghavi Law Office “work with schools on issues related to compliance with civil rights laws including Title IX, disability laws, and race and national origin discrimination laws.”\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Palfrey explained, “The response from the alumni body to the approach we have taken has been overwhelmingly supportive.”\n“The vast majority of those who have reached out to me have expressed their empathy toward those affected and their support for the process we have undertaken. In particular, the alumni who have chosen to write or call have noted the important tie between this process and our current work to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our current and future students,” he continued.\nIn his letter, Palfrey expressed gratitude to those who reported sexual misconduct to the school.\n“I admire the compassion and empathy displayed by those who came forward to share concerns of which they were aware,” wrote Palfrey. \n“Most of all, on behalf of the Andover community, I extend my deepest apologies to all who have been affected, directly or indirectly, by these transgressions that occurred on our campus,” he continued. \nPalfrey noted that there are likely still instances of sexual misconduct at Andover that have gone unreported, as well as other concerns that were raised, but the results of which were not conclusive upon investigation by Sanghavi Law Office.\n“We recognize that these matters do not reflect all harms suffered by students on our campus due to misconduct by adults or by other students,” he wrote in his letter to the community.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Palfrey wrote, on behalf of himself and the faculty of Andover, “We care about each and every one of you. We are focused on your well-being, as well as on your growth as students, musicians, artists, athletes, and citizens.”\nHe continued, “We do read the State of the Academy and we hear [students] when [they] say that sexual misconduct happens on our campus. We know that means that we have more work to do – more education to help prevent harm, more support to those affected, and an even clearer and stronger message to those who would contemplate or have harmed another member of this community.”\nPalfrey explained in his community letter that, as the school year begins, Andover is “redoubling [its] commitment to making our campus a safe and supportive home for students and adults alike.”\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Palfrey added, “I am committed to Andover being an institution whose graduates are leaders and contributors on this issue [of sexual misconduct] on their university campuses and in the communities where they make their lives after high school.”\nStay tuned for more coverage from The Phillipian on the ongoing sexual misconduct cases.\n\n', 'Sep 4, 2016'), ('\nStaff Report | The PhillipianPhoto-Illustration: A.KLIONSKY/THEPHILLIPIAN\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOn April 22, The Phillipian sent out the 2016 “State of the Academy” survey to all Andover students in the hopes of attaining valuable information about the Andover community.

Co-Head Angie Lara ’16 finds the event to be a great opportunity to show gratitude to the Paresky staff.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Lara said, “To me, it really just is an amazing opportunity to give back because I identify as a Latina. And the majority of the workers in Commons are also Latino, so just every single day essentially I get to see them, but there’s never really enough time to say thank you. You’re always rushing around and having to do work, so this is just a really good opportunity for me personally, and a lot of other people, to give back and say thanks and show them that we really appreciate them.”\nLara helped coordinate the event and organize the gifts that were given to the Paresky staff. This year, about 50 people attended.\n\n\n“As a club, we get together these nice little goodies, and, as a club, we try to say, as best as we can, thank you to the Commons workers because they just do so much for us,” said Lara. “This year we were able to give each individual worker a bunch of little jars in addition to a giant poster which a bunch of students signed. And we typically also hold games and raffles for them.”\nBefore Alianza Latina took on the organization of the event, Kip ran it herself to demonstrate the community’s gratitude toward the Paresky Commons staff.\n“For years, I would go every term and bring something fun and say thank you from all of us,” explained Kip. “But it was just me, and it wasn’t as big and it wasn’t so student-centered. Now, of course, I no longer have to do anything because the students do it instead, and I think that’s far more meaningful.”\n“By and large, students care deeply about the people who work in this building, and they express that,” Kip continued. “And I think that’s so nice. Because who doesn’t want to hear ‘Thank you’? And who doesn’t want to hear ‘We appreciate you’? We all need to hear that.”\nKip cites one of the challenges the Paresky Commons staff faces as anticipating the needs of Andover community.\n\n\n\n\n“It’s a long day, rain or shine, snow, sleep…. And you know it’s different. It’s very different because [students] are here all the time, but [the Paresky team is] not. It’s a very different world… They are trying to anticipate [students’] needs and make sure they are meeting [those] needs,” said Kip.\nPaul Robarge, Senior Food Services Director of Paresky Commons, believes that the Paresky team contributes to Andover’s strong food services program.\n“The team makes an enormous difference. We have an amazing group of chefs that are very, very passionate about foods. And we have a community that is very open to new and exciting things. That all put together makes for a great program,” said Robarge.\nWhile the event will not happen again until next year, students and faculty of the community continue to appreciate all the efforts of those working in Paresky.\n“Commons is really different from the cafeteria at my old school,” said Abby Enes ’18 in an interview with The Phillipian. “At home, not only was the food not very good, but the people weren’t very friendly. Here, everyone is really nice and they want to pro- vide you with food you actually enjoy.”\nParesky, which is run by a team of around eighty people, serves approximately 3,400 meals a day.

We got a good chance to see all the runners coming down from Bartlet Street. You could see pretty far down the road, and it was just a sea of pink! Everyone from Andover who was there was really excited to help cheer on the runners.”\n\nRitzer was part of the Class of 2007 of Andover High School. She graduated from Assumption College in 2011 and was pursuing a graduate degree at Salem State University. In 2013, Ritzer, while working at Danvers High, was murdered by one of her students with a history of mental illness. After her death, friends and relatives of Ritzer created “Step Up for Colleen” in 2014 in her honor. Runners were asked to wear pink, Ritzer’s favorite color. All profits made from the race go towards college scholarships for seniors in the Andover area who plan to major in education.\n\nJohnny Rex ’17, a runner in the race, said, “My sister is studying education at college, and she received the scholarship from the Ritzer family last year in her senior year at high school. We felt because the family is giving us the scholarship and they’ve been doing a lot for us, running at the race is really the least we can do for the family and for Colleen, and it seems like a really good cause. It’s actually our first year doing the race, but we’re definitely going to continue it in the future.”\n\nRex took part in the race to support the Ritzer family and to memorialize Colleen’s positive influence on the Andover community.\n\n“It is important to take part in these kind of events because it raises awareness of the issue. Who would have ever expected this to happen to the Ritzer family? The tragic event that she went through is eye opening to teachers and specifically women in education, and this event is definitely commemorating the life of Colleen. I think everyone was there to support the family,” said Rex.\n\nAnanda Kao ’18 also took part in the race for her third consecutive year.\n\n“I have run this race for three years now, in memory of Colleen Ritzer, her family, and all the people who were affected. It is always amazing to see how many people come out on this Sunday morning each year and race to support the Ritzers. I think it is important for people to take part in events like these to recognize the tragedies but also to support those most affected by them. When I was at the race, I could tell how much the Ritzers appreciate this event, and the joy that it brings them is why I race,” said Kao.\n\nChristopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, mainly helped strategize ways for members of the school to welcome the runners onto campus. Capano reached out to the Blue Key Heads and Drumline to help cheer the participants on.\n\n“It’s part of the town so we decided to be involved in some way. Because it’s a town thing, it nice to show some support towards the cause in some small way,” said Capano.\n\nThis year’s race offered features such as face painting, balloon artistry, and a photo booth. Many runners brought their baby joggers and dogs to accompany them throughout the run.\n\nPayton Jancsy ’16, member of 2015-2016 Blue Key Heads, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “There was a huge turnout for the runners, I was genuinely surprised to see just how many people came out in memory of Colleen; I think it speaks volumes to who she was as a person.

Kaufmann-LaDuc/The PhillipianGarnsey ’15 scored 47 goals and had 46 assists in his Post-Graduate (PG) year at Andover.\nAfter a Post-Graduate (PG) year in which he led Andover Boys Lacrosse to its best season in Andover’s recent history, with a 15-1 record, Ryder Garnsey ’15 has burst onto the NCAA Division I Lacrosse scene with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish this year. His phenomenal play secured him the title of Atlantic Coastal Conference (ACC) Freshman of the Year.\nPosting statistic lines unheard of for freshmen – who often don’t see the field in their first year at the collegiate level – Garnsey scored 19 goals and assisted on eight in his first season in South Bend.\nHis highlight of the season came in a 17-7 Notre Dame blowout of Syracuse University, in which he scored five goals. Garnsey wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “This year has been incredible. I’ve had the chance to play for what I think is the best coaching staff in the country and learn from the best player in the country who plays the same position as me, Matt Kavanagh, so I’ve just tried to be a sponge and take in as much as I can.”\nAndover teammate Foster LeBoeuf ’15, who now plays at Brown University, said, “It’s been great to see Ryder do his thing this year. He’s a great player and a great teammate and couldn’t be happier to see his successes and him getting the accolades for it.”\nFormer Captain Austin Gaiss ’14, another Andover Boys Lacrosse alum at Notre Dame, said, “Ryder has definitely earned everything he’s gotten this year. I think it’s pretty clear to everybody who’s seen a game of his that he’s quite the player, but I think what stands out the most to me is his competitiveness. More than anything the kid just wants to win and, especially heading into the tourney here, that’s almost more important than anything.”\nPlaying in all 12 of Notre Dame’s games, Garnsey led the ACC in points by a freshman, with 27 on the season. This kind of production mirrors the work he posted while at Andover under Head Coach Stephen Moreland, scoring 47 goals and notching 46 assists, which earned him a spot in the Under Armour All-America Game.\nAccording to former teammate and Captain Tim Bulens ’15, the sky is the limit for Garnsey.\n“When Ryder likes to do something, he’s one of the most tenacious, hard-working kids I know. There’s nothing he enjoys doing more than playing lacrosse. It’s a deadly combination that already has and will continue to take him to the top,” said Bulens.\nEven in South Bend, however, Garnsey still has ties to Andover in the form of old teammates and coaches and credits the Andover Coaching staff for much of his success at the next level. “The transition from PA to ND was definitely a challenge and I’m still adjusting every day but Coach Moreland and Coach Tuck did an incredible job preparing me for the next level and without them I would’ve had some catching up to do. I still talk to those guys all the time and Coach Moreland was one of the first people I called last night when I found out I was named [Rookie of the Year]. The difference is just that in practice and games every rep and play has to be done with 100 percent focus and determination. You can’t take plays off at all and if you do you’re getting worse while everybody around you is getting better,” said Garnsey.\nLikewise, many of Andover Lacrosse alumni playing at the collegiate level credit their success to their experiences at Andover.\n“As for the Andover lacrosse success at the collegiate level, it’s really great to be a part of it and I think a lot of that can be contributed to Coach Moreland; I think I speak for all us Andover lax alums in saying he is a great mentor and coach, both on and off the field,” said Leboeuf.\nThe future is bright for Garnsey and the Fighting Irish both this season and beyond, as the team has its eyes set on the 2016 NCAA Division I Championship Tournament.\nWhen asked about Garnsey, Head Coach of Notre Dame Lacrosse Kevin Corrigan wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Ryder is a breath of fresh air. He loves to play, has great skills that he has worked hard to develop, and has no conscience. Those are all good if married with a great work ethic and strong fundamentals… which he is working on. He has been an extremely valuable player for us this year… and his best is still to come. I love Ryder.”\nNotre Dame will hope to compete for a National Championship starting Saturday, May 21.\n\n', 'May 6, 2016'), ('\nCourtesy of Phillips Academy ArchivesRichard T. Greener, pictured in his senior portrait from 1865.\nFollowing speeches and a spirited gospel performance, Devontae Freeland ’15 unveiled a portrait of Andover’s first black graduate, Richard T. Greener, Class of 1865, alongside Harvard administrators last Thursday.\nGreener was the first black Andover graduate, and went on to become the first black Harvard graduate, when he graduated in 1870.\nThe Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations sponsored the unveiling of Greener’s portrait as part of its Portraiture Project, which aims to diversify portraits around campus.\nFreeland, a freshman at Harvard and an intern at the Harvard Foundation, has followed a similar academic path to Greener.\n“When I first heard that there was a plan to dedicate a portrait to Greener, I reached out to my boss, Dr. Counter, at the Harvard Foundation, explained my personal connection to Greener, and asked if there was anything I could do to make sure Andover was represented and incorporated in the programming. In turn, he asked me to speak at the unveiling,” wrote Freeland in an email to The Phillipian.\n“As a black student at elite, predominantly white institutions, I feel irrevocably tied to Greener because his journey cleared the path for me long ago. He proved himself – and therefore all blacks – worthy so that I would not have to,” Freeland continued.\nFreeland spoke alongside other Harvard students and administrators at the unveiling.\n“Richard T. Greener… stands as an icon, a scholar, a statesman, a Negro, a shining example of the Afro- American legacy,” said Freeland in his speech.\nUnwana Abasi ’13, a junior at Harvard, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Placing a portrait of Richard T. Greener in the Center of Annenberg Hall was an amazing way to honor his legacy. The portrait route demonstrates the importance of a lesson institutions like Harvard are beginning to understand more, and that is that representation matters. It matters to have role models like Greener visible to black and brown students who may reasonably take inspiration from the other, whiter portraits with a grain of salt.”\nAbasi continued, “He is a daily reminder that milestones in racial progress, small or large, must not only be an artifact of our past. They must, and do, exist in our present and our future.”\nFreeland had the honor of physically unmasking the portrait, alongside Dr. S. Allen Counter, Director of the Harvard Foundation.\n“As we pulled on the cord to unveil the portrait, I not only felt a part of history, but I felt a part of the future. Greener’s face now perpetually sits in a place where his legacy cannot be ignored,” said Freeland.\nThomas W. Franck -- The Harvard Crimson.Devontae Freeland ’15 spoke at the unveiling ceremony last week.\nFreeland graduated Andover exactly 150 years after Greener and was awarded the Richard T. Greener 1865 Endowment Scholarship upon his admission to Andover in 2011.\nThe Greener scholarship was established in 1989 by Andover alumni. It is a full-tuition scholarship given annually with, according to the Financial Aid Office, “preference for underrepresented students of color.”\n“One hundred fifty years after Greener’s graduation, 150 years after the end of the [American] Civil War, 150 years after the ratification of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments… I felt a great deal of personal connection,” said Freeland in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\nSteve Coit, Harvard alum and official portrait painter of the Portraiture Project, spent a considerable amount of time researching Greener before starting the painting.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Coit wrote, “Apparently at the time, Andover was so focused on training students in Latin and Greek that Greener found himself at Harvard ill-prepared in math and science, and had to take a ‘gap year’ (before it was called that) to catch up with everyone else.”\n“But it also sounds like Andover is where he really started to hit his stride,” continued Coit. “His roommate in Stoughton, the dorm pictured in the portrait, was also his best friend from Andover.”\nCoit’s portrait of Greener is on full display in Annenberg Hall, the Freshman dining hall at Harvard.\n“It’s really exciting for me to see Greener’s face everyday in the dining hall in which I eat,” said Freeland.\nRobert Rush ’14, a sophomore at Harvard, was also a recipient of the Greener Scholarship, and was in attendance at the unveiling ceremony. Like Freeland, Rush is hoping that Andover will show more recognition toward Greener and his legacy.\n“When I found [out] who [Greener] was and what he accomplished, it reaffirmed my place at Andover,” wrote Rush in an email to The Phillipian. “But it also disappointed me that Andover hasn’t recognized him and other African-American students that challenged the status quo. I hope that this example at Harvard will push Andover to recognize the importance of having equal representation, both in student body and in its history.”\nGreener’s legacy at Andover currently lives on by way of the scholarship in his name and a framed copy of a “ Phillips Bulletin,” from July 1922, which features him and hangs next to the entrance of the Office of Community and Multicultural Development.\n“I would really love to see some physical recognition or commemoration of Greener at Andover… whether that’s a portrait, plaque, room,” said Freeland.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Head of School John Palfrey, who was invited by Freeland to the ceremony but was unable to attend, said, “Richard T. Greener was a trailblazing intellectual and visionary leader whose character continued to blossom during his time at Andover. I am incredibly grateful to Harvard for choosing to honor his legacy with such permanence and visibility.”\n\n', 'May 6, 2016'), ('\nGiving students the opportunity to voluntarily dispose of contraband material without repercussions, Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, and David Gardner, Dean of Pine Knoll Cluster, conducted a “anonymous disposal” of Stimson House for contraband material last Wednesday night.\nResidents of Stimson were asked by their house counselors to be in the common room for a dorm meeting at 10:00 p.m., and were met by Elliott and Gardner. The students’ parents and guardians were notified of the Deans’ visit to the dorm by email. \n“Everyone deserves to live in a drug and alcohol free dorm. When we are worried about the decision making of our students, we will continue to communicate our worries with candor and care,” wrote Elliott in an email to The Phillipian.\nUnlike the search carried out in Taylor Hall last December – in which Elliott, several Cluster Deans, and house counselors thoroughly searched each student’s room – Elliott and Gardner did not enter into students’ rooms. Instead, they asked the dorm’s five Proctors to collect all drug paraphernalia and illicit substances that was in the dorm.\nErin McMahon, a House Counselor in Stimson and Teaching Fellow in Spanish and French, said, “While I don’t think the entire dorm has a problem, I think it’s just a very few number of girls who have been abusing substances. But I think it was an important message both to those girls that we’re very serious about substance-free living here and also a message to the rest of the dorm saying we care about your choice to remain substance free and we’re honoring that by letting your dorm mates basically give up anything they may or may not have.”\nWednesday’s search of Stimson is indicative of a greater policy shift on part of the Dean of Students Office. A similar anonymous disposal was conducted last November in Taylor Hall – with a dorm-wide search occurring a month later in December – in Bishop Hall in February, and in Andover Cottage in January.\nDecember’s full search of Taylor, which involved Head of School John Palfrey and other high-profile administrators in the decision-making process, was the first search of its kind in at least seven years, and resulted in the confiscation of illicit substances and other items of contraband in roughly a third of the rooms. The Taylor search, according to Elliott, was conducted in response to multiple infractions involving drugs and alcohol at the beginning of the school year, which McMahon cites as similar reasoning behind her dorm’s anonymous disposal.\n“We had been getting various reports throughout the year from custodial people finding alcohol as well as just the girls in general,” said McMahon. “How much of that is rumor, how much of that is true—we don’t know. But when someone says like, ‘Oh, Stimson, they have alcohol there,’ we want to take that seriously. We wanted to make sure that if it’s the case that there are girls who have alcohol or any other substances in our dorm, we wanted to give them the opportunity to give it up anonymously.”\nShoshi Wintman ’17, a two-year resident of Stimson, said, “On one hand, I don’t think dorm searches are great, because I feel like it violates people’s privacy,” said Wintman. “But I also don’t think what Ms. Elliott did was horrible. As of yet, she hasn’t searched the dorm, and all she said was: Put in your stuff and there won’t be any repercussions.”\nOut of over 900 respondents in the 2016 “State of the Academy” (due to be released in the May 13 issue of The Phillipian), 49 percent said that they do not believe the administration should be able to search an entire dorm for contraband material, while 51 percent responded that the administration should have the ability to do so. \n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nAfter four months of coding and honing their presentation skills, three teams are tackling a challenge to build and present their own app in the international Technovation Challenge. The teams, SynTech, Serenity, and Thrively, are working alongside the Tang Institute and presented their ideas to the Andover community this past Wednesday.\nThe Technovation Challenge is a global competition for girls that asks participants to find a solution to a problem within each team’s community. This is Andover’s second year taking part in the competition.\n SynTech is made up of Serena Ren ’18, Jocelyn Shen ’18, Sarah Zhao ’18, and Anjalie Kini ’19. Together, they have created a time-management app called “Sorbet.”\n “ ‘Sorbet’ aims to help every member of a community live a happier, healthier, and more organized lifestyle. ‘Sorbet’ not only helps you manage your time, but also encourages taking advantage of the support that only an entire community can provide,” said Kini during the Tang Institute presentation.\n The SynTech team distinguished their app from competitors’ by adding a social aspect to help manage time. Students can subscribe to channels made by their peers or teachers, giving them access to keep track of all assignments and events.\n A support feature has also been integrated so students can indicate whether they are stressed and need help. Friends and classmates are appropriately notified to send the student the support needed.\n Ren said, “We designed ‘Sorbet’ to promote the fun and relaxing atmosphere we think all schools should have. This is something our competitors have not included. Also, they do not have a minimized set-up time nor do they encourage students to support each other or take advantage of the power of a community that works together.” \n Serenity is a team formed by Deyana Marsh ’17, Natalia Suarez ’17, and Diva Harsoor ’18. The team aims to help users reduce stress through fun activities in their app “nChill.”\n “Serenity’s biggest goal is reducing stress on our campus. Our app is called ‘nChill,’ and it’s meant to [help users] release stress by providing fun activities and games that take your mind off of your problems and help you relax,” said Harsoor.\n “Our app will have four main features, but when you first open the app you will see a mood indicator, which is on a zero to ten scale – zero being extremely stressed and ten being not stressed at all. After that, you go to the four activities, which are meditation, yoga, stretching, and bubble wrap,” Harsoor continued.\n Thrively is a team composed of Lauren Luo ’16, Camilla Guo ’17, Lila Brady ’18, Darcy Burnham ’18, and Miriam Feldman ’18. They aim to promote wellness by setting up friendly competition between users of their app “Rumble.”\n “With ‘Rumble,’ users build a team to engage in fun, short-term wellness challenges measuring average water consumed, hours slept, and steps walked daily,” said Burnham.\n “Rumble” will operate in communities that have a common email domain, allowing users to form teams within dorms, classes, or departments.\n “Team-based challenges and user-input incentives are the key features that distinguish ‘Rumble’ from our competitors. We are capitalizing on university and prep school students’ natural competitiveness by creating an app that users feel responsible for and that they can come back to,” said Feldman.\n While Technovation is an app design and creation competition, very few of Andover’s competitors had previous experience in coding. One of Technovation’s purposes is to encourage girls to get involved with coding.\nSuarez said, “You think it is a lot harder than it is. Granted, it does take a lot of time and it’s not easy, but you think of making an app and having a business plan as something an adult would do and not really as something you could be able to do in high school, but if you actually want to do it, all you really need is a business plan and an app. From there, you can conquer the world.”\nIn the 2015 Technovation Challenge, WoCo, one of Andover’s own teams, took second place globally and first place nationally with their app “PraisePop.” WoCo also received the inaugural U.N. Women Prize for the Top National Team.\n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nFor students who struggle to understand complex scientific topics, visual aids can often make a world of difference in promoting comprehension. NestEd speaker Gaël McGill, a professor at Harvard Medical School, is hoping to create more helpful science visualizations. \nMcGill visited Andover on Wednesday night to present in The Nest, in the basement of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. In his talk, McGill discussed his studies of the intersection between science and art. McGill uses art and visualizations to make scientific topics, biology in particular, easier for students to comprehend.\n“A lot of our work explores the intersection between science and art, and not just how the two touch as disciplines, but how you might use an artistic approach to achieve things in science, and how you might use a scientific approach, or way of thinking, to develop visual communications, as you communicate with other people,” said McGill. \nMcGill has spent over six years at Harvard Medical School creating visualizations to make difficult biology topics more approachable for all people.\n“If you have too much data and you’re trying to make sense of it, you can use visualization tools and you can leverage the power of the human visual system to find patterns and to find more meaningful results off of what is otherwise just a pile of numbers on a spreadsheet,” said McGill. “And, not just for those of us who are scientists, but for anyone who is learning, for students. The visualizations we create are intended not only to help you learn and understand an aspect of science, but to remember it, and to do things with it.”\nMcGill focuses on design to capture readers’ attention and make concepts easy to understand. \n“Everything we do is a little bit of science, technology, software, art and design… The impact of design on the visuals you create have an impact on your learning outcomes,” said McGill.\nAmong the attendees of McGill’s presentation was Jeremiah Hagler, Instructor of Biology. Hagler uses McGill’s visualizations in many of the biology classes he teaches at Andover. \n“I use them all the time in my class,” said Hagler in an interview with The Phillipian. “I think they allow students to actually see what’s going on in a real way, it’s actually accurate representations of data, so kids aren’t getting a misrepresentation of what’s actually going on. This is sort of a real, accurate representation. They actually see the wonder of the biology, how it actually works. It’s much better than abstract animation, or writing on a chalkboard or something. You actually see what’s going on, and have an idea of how it’s going. It’s very powerful.”\nThis clarity for students is what McGill ultimately intends to achieve with each of the visualizations he produces.\nMcGill said, “For me, what is most important about visualizations is that there are very clear learning objectives. Everything we do in the visualizations, how we design them, how long we make them, how we make them, is based on who the audience is and what is it that I want you to walk away with after watching it. So it’s being really focused on the target audience, and making sure that the visualization meets the learning objectives.”\nHenry Desai ’17, an attendee, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Everyone likes to simplify things in, as [McGill] said, the hope of making things more learnable. But sometimes showing people the full picture can give people a greater appreciation of what’s really happening, and make people more interested in it.”\nGracie Limoncelli ’18, who was also an audience member, said, “I thought [the presentation] was really amazing, I was just smiling the entire time because it was so exciting honestly. I think the idea of building the models could really help you understand the ideas a lot better… Learning photosynthesis could just be so much easier!”\n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nThe sight of three friends in a silent embrace stood out even amid the energy and music pulsating throughout the Case Memorial Cage during last Saturday’s Relay for Life. \nRelay for Life is a national event that aims to raise awareness and funds to support cancer research. The event usually lasts for 24 hours and is hosted by schools and organizations all over the country. Andover’s abridged four-hour version of Relay for Life is organized and hosted by the club Campuses Against Cancer, and its donations are given to the American Cancer Society. The event raised 54,024 dollars. The coordinators of the event hoped to improve campus-wide attendance and to match last year’s overall donation of nearly 70,000 dollars.\n“We increased in participation, which was one of our main goals. We wanted the community here to be able to experience the event and show us why they want to support the fight against this disease,” said Kyle Kingston ’16, President of Campuses Against Cancer.\nFollowing the Relay’s tradition, the night began with an opening ceremony followed by the Survivor’s Lap, a lap taken only by those who have survived the disease. Afterwards, teams of students and faculty members took to the track to begin a march to raise money for the American Cancer Society. The event featured dance performances by Sara Luzuriaga ’16, Lizzie McGonagle ’16, Alexa Goulas ’18, and Kiki Kozol ’18, as well as music performances by The Yorkies and Azure.\nThe continual marching of students was broken only once during the night as the lights were turned off and students gathered in the center of the track for the Luminaria Ceremony. Silence fell over the Cage as Alex Kruizenga ’18 and Luzuriaga went to the stage to share the impact of cancer on their lives. Sam Hawley ’16 concluded the ceremony with the song “Follow the Sun” by Xavier Rudd, and students were then asked to do a single lap in absolute silence. \n“Every year I’ve done the Relay, the community has shown me something different and better than before; the spirit of remembrance and love shone through this year. We had a particularly moving night with deeply impactful speakers as well as an energy from all our participants that could not be duplicated,” wrote Mihika Sridhar ’16, Senior Board Member of Campuses Against Cancer, in an email to The Phillipian.\nIn addition to the Relay for Life, Campuses Against Cancer is responsible for other events and dialogue on campus.\nKingston said, “We basically foster discussion around cancer and the impact it can have on a community and an individual. We often screen movies – for example, we screened ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ once. We sometimes hold bake sales to gather money to donate to various charities. It’s been a crazy year so this year we focused solely on the relay which happens every year during Non Sibi Weekend. Most of our efforts are put towards the Relay for Life.”\nLike many of the events’ participants, Kingston has an understanding of the effects of the disease, and hopes that the funds raised by students will help the fight against cancer.\n“I walk for countless family members, especially my cousin who’s here tonight, who’s a survivor, as well as her dad, who’s currently still battling. I also walk because cancer is a terrible disease… There’s no other way to put it. I don’t ever want another individual to hear the words ‘you have cancer,’ or ‘your relative or your loved one has cancer.’ So I walk to end this disease once and for all,” said Kingston.\nPayton Jancsy ’16, a Senior Board Member of Campuses Against Cancer, said, “One of my really good family friends, Cecile, was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago… The whole family came together to support her. I’ve been impacted by cancer in that way, and lots of people have been impacted by cancer in numerous ways so any way I could help and try and find a cure is definitely something that I want to do.”\nCampus Against Cancer members are already looking towards next year’s relay and are hoping to continue to expand the event and its impact on campus.\n “To those unsure of attending the Relay, I would just say that you missed out on one of the best nights of the year,” said Sridhar. “This event is one I truly love because it brings people from all corners of campus together for a common cause.

Throughout her period of sickness, Fulford received help and support from members of the Andover community. She was motivated to create the garden as a sign of gratitude to these people.\n“I had a year that I was sick and people were so kind to me at this school. They brought dinners, and rides to the hospital, and we had a tiny, tiny garden. Somebody said, ‘the person who lives here is going to live because this garden is life,’” Fulford said in an interview with The Phillipian. “After that I decided I wanted to make the garden beautiful as a thank you to the community for all the help they gave me, because people helped me when I did not even know their names,” she continued.\nThe garden was dubbed the “Garden of Eaton” by the students of Eaton Cottage, and its variety of colorful plants goes 360 degrees around the dorm.\nInspired by her passion for mathematics, Fulford modeled her garden to a Cartesian plane with a stone wall that serves as the x-axis. The flowers that bloom from April through October are each organized to form even, odd, inverse, and logarithmic functions, although they have lost their form over many years.\n“I like the way [the flowers] look – the reciprocal functions – I think that looks pretty. The inverse function was perfectly symmetrical. It was perfect. Now it has lost its shape a little,” said Fulford.\nAlexandra Loumidis ’18, a resident of Eaton Cottage, is pleased by the presence of the garden. She especially appreciates how the flowers allow for many high-quality pictures and noted that the garden is a defining feature of the dorm.\nIn an email to The Phillipian, Loumidis wrote, “Each day as I run in and out of the dorm, I can smell the tulips lining the entrance and the daffodils along the side wall of the garden. The tulips are quite colorful and make for an artsy Snapchat story in a pinch (no filter needed.) I have seen the daffodils grow in number from the very beginning of Spring Term. I have also witnessed them persist through the cold and even [through] the snow.”\xa0\nThe design of the garden changes each year with the help of Howie Kalter ’07, Teaching Fellow in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, during the 2014-2015 school year.\nFor the upcoming summer, Fulford aspires to plant a trigonometric function.\n“The right side of the garden is still wild. [Kalter] thinks it is going to be too hard to [plant a trigonometric function]. He just wants a basic line, but I am going to see if we can try to do a sine function,” said Fulford.\nFulford believes that the garden represents life with all its growing plants. She hopes the garden adds to the beauty of campus, and that people can sit and enjoy the vibrant flowers. \n“I think it is important that the garden is seen as a gift to the community from me. I love [keeping up the garden], but it is a gift for people to come by and enjoy the beauty and to realize that it is life,” said Fulford. “I feel like it is a gift from God.”\n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nDigging up weeds and spreading layers of compost in the hot morning sun, participants of Non Sibi Weekend’s Campus Garden program worked to beautify Andover’s garden. Produce from the garden is donated to the Merrimack Valley Food Bank in Lowell, Mass.\nDuring this year’s Non Sibi Weekend, some students chose to work at the campus garden, preparing its soil for planting. For Maddie Zerbey ’18, who had no previous farming or gardening experience, the event offered a chance to learn more about the vegetable cultivation process, as well as to give back to the Andover community.\nZerbey said, “Gardening is a lot harder than it looks! But it was really nice to be able to give back to the school, because our motto is Non Sibi, but I feel like we don’t always act it out in our own lives. To have a day set out of our school year to just give back to the community or the communities around us was really rewarding.”\n“I chose Campus Garden because I wanted to stay on campus, and I was interested to see where the garden was, because I really didn’t know that we had one,” said Zerbey.\nEach class’s programs focused on a central theme. Juniors focused on the needs of families, Lowers on the environment, Uppers on health and hunger, and Seniors on housing and homelessness. The themes were initially introduced as a part of the reformed Non Sibi Weekend model in 2014, when Non Sibi Weekend was moved to April, and students’ choices were limited to programs that met their class theme. \nMonique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Engagement, said, “We picked those themes because they directly correlate with the programming that we offered throughout the year as well. For example, if a student goes to the Boys & Girls Club during Non Sibi Weekend, there’s a chance to work with the Boys & Girls Club throughout the year.”\nThis year’s Non Sibi Weekend featured a wide variety of programs, including clearing bushes at an animal preserve and visiting the Boston office of Jumpstart, an organization that recruits and trains college students to teach preschoolers in low-income neighborhoods. \nEliot Min ’19 traveled with his group to the Boston headquarters of Room to Grow, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of impoverished babies. While there, Min sorted children’s clothes by age before they could be distributed to underprivileged families.\xa0\n“It was really fun working together with everyone to see how quickly we could sort out all the clothes. The woman [from Room to Grow] was really nice and she explained why it was such a good cause, so we could use that as motivation. It was really fun,” said Min.\nMin didn’t know what Non Sibi Weekend was before the sign-up emails were sent out, but he quickly caught on to the significance of the programming.\n“I didn’t really understand what the concept of Non Sibi was. When I realized it meant ‘not for self,’ I realized that we would be doing community service. I really took that to heart and tried to make the most out of it,” said Min. \nNicholas Rauen ’16 chose the Faces of Homelessness program, in which students were given presentations by former homeless people.\n“The entire idea was sort of to humanize the homeless, because the homeless have a large issue with being looked over as if they’re not human,” said Rauen. “We talked with someone who was very prominent with the entire problem, and then we talked to people who had been homeless, had been dealing with this issue. It was very interesting, because it’s not really a perspective you get at Andover, so that was very nice.”\nCueto-Potts hopes that current students will continue to follow the message of Non Sibi Weekend and participate in community engagement programs throughout their lives.\n“I think it’s important because it extends our learning beyond the walls of the classroom, and really gives our entire community an opportunity not just to learn about issues that are affecting people in society, but how organizations and people are working to address those issues that are affecting people,” said Cueto-Potts. \nAlthough Non Sibi Weekend is the one day a year every student is involved with a community engagement program, Cueto-Potts wants to stress the fact that the weekend is just a small part of a larger, year-long opportunity for working in and around the Andover community.\nCueto-Potts said, “[This] needs to be more than one day, and it is more than one day. We have about 400 students engaged in programs on a weekly basis every single term, so… it’s part of the larger mission of our office that includes programming six days a week, every week of the school year.”\n“We’re really fortunate to have the budget and the staff and the support that we do have. I think it’s just important to highlight that it’s not just one day, it’s just part of something bigger,” continued Cueto-Potts.\n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nA sophomore in college in 2000, Onaje X. Offley Woodbine was the leading scorer for the Yale Basketball team. In 2001, however, Woodbine walked away from the courts and traveled to Africa in search of his spiritual roots. Today, he uses his experience as a basketball player to reflect upon the role that spirituality plays on the courts. \nWoodbine, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies at Andover, explores how African-American youth use basketball as a tool for expressing grief in his new book “Black Gods of the Asphalt,” to be published in May 2017. As part of his research for the book, he interviewed young men and women playing streetball, or street basketball, in predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods in Boston, such as Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan.\nWoodbine said in an interview with The Phillipian, “What I discovered was that these young men and women weren’t just going to the courts to be exploited, because that is the general theme in literatures… that black men and women play basketball because they are poor, or they feel inferior in other social fields like in the classroom. What I discovered was while those things push young men and women to play, when they get on the court they [are] actually experiencing quite a bit of meaning, and they are also expressing agency and freedom and resistance.”\n“Black Gods of the Asphalt” draws on themes of memory, hope, and healing to convey the connection between basketball and spirituality, according to Woodbine.\n“After being traumatized or experiencing violence in the streets, [the players] would go to the court and something else would open up, and that experience could be… the presence of an ancestor, who had just passed away, been shoot, killed, or stabbed and killed, and they would feel that person on the court. And the ball, the hoop, and their bodies would turn into almost vocabulary for communication with that person. When the ball went in there was a sign that there was a back and forth going on.”\nWoodbine found writing about the spiritual nature of basketball for African-American youths to be a highly personal experience; he even played ball with his interviewees.\n“It was an ethnography, and it was self-reflexive, which means that I used my own body, as a text as well, to feel the forces that were at play in their skin. I played [basketball] myself, with them [and] got to know many of them. I am from that area, so that also was helpful to get an insider’s perspective. But I also interviewed [the players]. I spent a lot of time [with the players] and I got very close with many of the young men,” said Woodbine.\nGrowing up in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury in Boston, Woodbine knew from a very young age that he wanted to play basketball. In high school he participated in a program for school integration and was frequently bussed to Newton South High School to play basketball.\n“I played ball there, and actually, ball was the only consistent thing between both the inner city and the predominantly white school… A lot of the young black men [that came] from inner city felt out of place… [and] I ended up dropping out. But I think what saved me in that sense, in both spaces, was that I could play ball,” said Woodbine.\nWhen he played basketball for Yale, Woodbine found the men’s program to resemble a business more than a team. \n“[The] Yale basketball program was more business oriented than the inner-city experience with basketball that I had. Yale basketball felt more corporate, it was more focused on wins and losses, there was less opportunity for self-expression, creativity, individuality, there were also – you know – experiences in the locker room that tended to promote a kind of sexual objectification of women, and there were also some racial issues,” said Woodbine. \n“And so, being in Yale and playing ball came as a shock that the focus was quite different from the familial environment of basketball that I grew up in,” Woodbine continued. \nAfter Woodbine left the Yale Basketball team, he traveled to Ghana and Nigeria to connect with his spiritual roots by studying African religion and philosophy.\n“That was sort of a return to memory, so the way I look at it is like there’s a time of innocence when you are born, there is the loss of innocence, when you recognize that there is evil in the world, that things are not okay,” said Woodbine.\nFor Woodbine, writing his book contributed to his search for identity. He hopes that “Black Gods of the Asphalt” will help other young African-Americans find themselves and that his ethnographic research will function as a bridge of understanding between predominantly black and predominantly white communities.\n“One of the hardest things in the book was finding words to what was happening in this space, and I thought that would be a helpful and powerful tool for [the youths] to be able to say in words what is going on, to share that… To see that these are human beings, to see… that all of these questions, [such as ‘Who Am I?’] are being asked by young black men in the streets, so that was important,” said Woodbine. \n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nAfter many years of ongoing leadership in the domestic workers movement, Ai-jen Poo ’92 returned to Andover to accept the Claude Moore Fuess Award, Andover’s highest distinction.\nThe Fuess Award commemorates Claude Fuess, who served Andover for more than 40 years as an instructor and as the tenth Head of School. Established in 1964, the Fuess Award is given to graduates who embody Non Sibi by making distinguished contributions to public service.\nStudents had the opportunity to hear Poo speak at All-School Meeting (ASM) about her personal motivations for embodying Non Sibi ideals and her contributions to the domestic workers movement. Currently serving as the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an organization that empowers domestic workers to serve as their own advocates, Poo is also the co-director of Caring Across Generations, an organization campaigning for public policies that will benefit both the elderly and their caretakers. From early on in her childhood, Poo’s close relationship with her grandparents was a source of constant moral support and guidance.\n“I come from an immigrant family and had the great gift of growing up with my grandparents. From my grandmother, I learned how to appreciate and cultivate laughter. From my grandfather, I learned hard work and discipline,” said Poo during her presentation.\nPoo was motivated to fight for the rights of domestic workers after experiencing firsthand the importance of a strong system of support for both domestic workers and the families and individuals they care for.\n“After my grandfather turned 90, his vision and other functions deteriorated. My father was unable to find appropriate home care support for him and had to place him in a nearby nursing home against his wishes… My grandfather’s bed was in a dark room with half a dozen other people. It smelled of mold and illness. Though he was alive enough to tell me he was afraid, I knew he was dying inside,” said Poo. \n“On the other hand, my maternal grandmother is still alive, and she just turned 90. She’s living life on her terms. Mrs. Sun is the home care worker who looks after my grandmother. My uncles and my mom do a lot for my grandmother, but none of us can imagine our lives without Mrs. Sun’s support,” she continued.\nPoo recognized the impact her grandmother’s caregiver had on her family’s life, yet finds that domestic work is still the most underappreciated work in the economy today. \n“What could be more important than caring for the people who cared for us? And yet it’s among some of the most undervalued work in our economy today. There are no standards, no guidelines, nothing mediating the relationship. It’s the kind of job that’s not even seen as a real job,” said Poo.\nPoo related her struggle for representation for caregivers and domestic workers to the Non Sibi ideals instilled in her during her time at Andover.\n“Working with caregivers has reinforced for me the spirit of Non Sibi that I learned here at Andover. Domestic workers and caregivers embody in their work the spirit of not for self. They go to work every day and support the dignity and well-being of others. There is something uniquely human about caring and doing for others. It is what makes us human,” said Poo.\nPoo described how her time at Andover further impacted her mindset towards community engagement.\n“In doing Non Sibi we become the people we were always meant to be… I was always afforded so many opportunities here to connect, to do community service, to get involved on campus, [and] to do things that expressed the different ways that I cared about the world around me and other people, and I think those opportunities completely shaped how I see the world and what I chose to do,” said Poo in an exclusive interview with The Phillipian.\nPoo’s optimism and drive come from her experiences in her nonprofit work as well. \n“I have watched over and over again, how a group of people who care about the same things, and care about each other, come together with a plan and a vision,” said Poo. “It’s been at the heart and soul of every major social movement that has brought progress to this country. And we can start today.”\n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nBright lights glowed in the hands of Take Back the Night participants as they gathered beneath the blue clock of Samuel Phillips Hall that lit up the darkening sky. Donning teal ribbons – the symbol for Sexual Assault Awareness Month – students awaited the start of the event with palpable excitement.\nAndover was selected as one of ten schools to participate in Take Back the Night, an event that aims to raise awareness of sexual violence and sexual assault. This is the first time Andover has hosted the Take Back the Night event. Starting in the early 1970s, Take Back the Night helps give a voice to survivors by breaking the silence that often accompanies issues of sexual assault, a topic that is often disregarded in public. \nSofia Tirado, Teaching\xad Fellow in English, played a key role in organizing the event. Working closely with Flavia Vidal and Tasha Hawthorne, Co-Directors of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and Instructors in English, Tirado corresponded with the Take Back the Night Foundation and the other nine schools participating in this year’s event. \n“Sexual assault, a lot of times, perpetuates silence on part of the victim. And so what we wanted to do was to shine a light, and to speak out and do readings to kind of break that silence, and to allow the voice of the survivor to speak, a little bit, or at least to just be present… I wanted to show awareness about sexual assault, and I wanted to give a platform and a voice for survivors of sexual assault,” said Tirado.\n“I think Take Back the Night’s goal is to sort of say [that] survivors’ experiences matter, and their voices matter, and they need to speak out and allies are here to support them. I think for me it was all about shattering the silence,” she continued.\nThis year’s event was sponsored by the Brace Center Student and Faculty Advisory Board. \nVidal said, “The person from our board who really took the initiative for being the main point person for the event was Ms. Tirado. So our role, mine and Dr. Hawthorne’s, was to support her and to give her any help that she needed as the whole planning process unfolded from the beginning of Winter Term.”\nThe event itself consisted of a march from Sam Phil to the Abbot Circle, led by the Blue Key Heads and Drumline. Carrying a banner, the Blue Key Heads shouted chants such as “it’s on us” and “no means no, yes means yes,” in sync with Drumline’s beat. \nUpon arriving to the Abbot Circle, students reflected in silence while excerpts of poetry and articles related to sexual assault were read by Brace Student Leaders. Following the candlelight vigil, student a capella groups Azure, Keynotes, and Yorkies, as well as Gospel Choir, performed a combined number to close the event.\n“I think other high schools should follow our lead, so to speak, and have these conversations in high school, because sexual assault is an issue that happens in high school, and it’s part of a lot of high school communities so, it’s something that needs to be addressed,” said Tirado.\nOne of the readings discussed street harassment, an issue relevant not only to the Andover’s campus, but also the town of Andover. \n“[Street harassment is] a really big thing on this campus. On Main Street, I get called on the street when I’m walking by cars, and that’s something that we need to talk about. Because I’m new, this is my first year as a teacher, I really needed that information, but it was good, It was good to work with the students, and they all kind of brought different scales and different ideas, so it was very good collaboration,” said Tirado.\nTirado relied on information from students to help her in organizing the event.\nAs a new teacher on campus this term, Tirado found student input on street harassment helpful and continued to work with students throughout the organization of the event. \n“I think that anytime you organize a large event it’s difficult to, especially for me as a new person, it’s difficult to understand where this community is and what they may need or want from an event like this. So in sort of creating our idea of what we’re gonna do in the speeches and readings, I had to really rely on the students to give us information,” said Tirado. \nJustice Robinson ’18, a member of Tirado’s subcommittee and the Brace Student Advisory Board, hopes Take Back the Night provokes more conversations surrounding sexual assault and violence across campus. \n“I definitely think that the increased level of conversations [on sexual assault], not only in quantity… but also [in] quality… there is, without a doubt, so much more room to do more. We haven’t even scratched the surface in what we discussed and what needs to be done, like learning about sexual health and sexual safety,” said Robinson. \nFollowing the showing of “The Mask You Live In” in the fall and “SLUT: The Play” in the winter, Take Back the Night is the Brace Center’s main event for Spring Term.\nVidal said, “Our hope is really for one more event to bring the community together for open conversation and sort of awareness of this issue to begin with. One of our main agenda items for the Brace Center this year is to continue the conversation that started when the Brace Center last year organized the Secondary School Conference on preventing gender\xad-based violence and sexual assault. So this has been a continuation of the recommendations that came out of that conference, and really our main focus is this year.” \n\n', 'May 4, 2016'), ('\nAndover, Mass. — At 9:18 p.m. on Monday evening, Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, sent an email alerting the Andover community that a man with five outstanding warrants was believed to have run into the Cochran Bird Sanctuary, a 65-acre woodland area on Andover’s campus. \n“The police believe that this individual ran into the Sanctuary,” Elliott wrote in her email. “He is wearing a gray hoodie and jeans; he is Hispanic, 36-years old and 5’4”… Do not go into the Sanctuary.”\nBoarding students were advised to return to their dormitories, and day students were asked to proceed to either the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library or George Washington Hall. \nThe suspect was later identified by the Andover Police Department (A.P.D.) to be Jose Rivera DeJesus. \nAccording to police logs cited in “The Eagle-Tribune,” an A.P.D. officer received word that DeJesus was on his way to the Memorial Circle neighborhood in a cab. Officers attempted to stop the cab, but DeJesus took off on foot and hopped over the fence into the Sanctuary.\nThe Massachusetts State Police, in partnership with Phillips Academy Public Safety (PAPS) and A.P.D., sent a search helicopter above the Sanctuary, where it proceeded to circle for roughly an hour. Several cars from the A.P.D. were also at the scene, according to Elliott’s email. The A.P.D. also reported that a K-9 unit assisted with the search.\n“We had limited information from the Andover Police, they were working with our Public Safety, and our Public Safety was actually supporting their efforts. But at no time was [A.P.D.] concerned that any of our students were in danger; they needed our cooperation in terms of looking at, and looking in the Sanctuary where they suspected that this individual had fled,” said Elliott in an interview with The Phillipian.\nA “be on the lookout” (BOLO) alert was sent to Andover residents, said Amy Morris, Senior Communications Specialist for the school, in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\n“The town is completely in cooperation with campus security as well as the Massachusetts State Police,” Morris said. “At this point there’s no reason to believe that anyone is in danger, and no one has been hurt.”\nAccording to the “Eagle Tribune,” DeJesus’s warrants include a probation violation, assault and battery, and larceny.\nAt 9:35 p.m., the text alert system was used to communicate with the Andover community as quickly as possible.\n“The email was sent with an awareness that not all kids would be [on] email, so that’s why we sent text alert as quickly as we could,” said Elliott in an interview with The Phillipian. “Then we tried to follow-up with parents to give them an update, but obviously… the most important issue was trying to make sure that kids were safe and that the kids had information.”\nAt 10:35 p.m., Elliott informed students and faculty members in a follow-up email that the Andover Police Department search had been called off, as the suspect was believed to have left the immediate area.\nElliott said Tom Conlon, Director of Public Safety, is in regular contact with the A.P.D so that Andover is notified immediately of anything that may impact the safety of its community. \n“The Andover Police… is always highly communicative. And we reach out to the Andover Police in that way, but at this point we have no reason to believe that the individual has any need to be on our campus – that not something we are worried about,” said Elliott.\nAs of yet, the police are still locating DeJesus.

P.A.C.T.F. aims to fill this gap with the primary goal of educating students about computer security and sparking their interest in the field.”\nEach participating team has a maximum of five competitors, and together they engage in problem sets created by the program directors. Problems gradually increase in difficulty to test the participant’s hacking abilities.\n“Their goal is to decipher, break, inject, or do whatever else it takes to locate a (planted) piece of information called a ‘flag,’ which is then redeemed for points. This is generally done by exploiting a vulnerability in, say, the encryption algorithm used to hide the data, or a bug in the password verifier used to hide a certain part of a site,” wrote Wong in an email to The Phillipian. “The goal is for students to learn more about common, and even uncommon, pitfalls in app or site design that can lead to disastrous information breaches.”\nAfter competing in several C.T.F., Agarwal, Orgul, Tan, and Wong were driven to recreate the competition at Andover, differentiating their idea from the original by lengthening its duration and broadening its range of participants.\nThe P.A.C.T.F. challenges are weeklong, with a total of three challenges lasting throughout April and May. The first round of P.A.C.T.F., “Crypto,” began on April 10 and ended on April 17.\n“[Cryptography] problems often start off with a coded text and in order to solve the problem you have to decode that text in English,” said Orgul in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“Binary,” the second round of P.A.C.T.F., was carried out from April 18 to April 24.\n“In ‘Binary’ problems you are given a computer program. In order to crack these, many times you have to exploit weaknesses in the programming used, which will allow you to use the program in ways it wasn’t meant,” said Orgul.\nFinally, the last round of P.A.C.T.F., called “Web,” is currently underway. It began on April 25 and will end on May 1.\n“In some ‘Web’ problems, we designed websites with specific weaknesses where programming code can be injected into input fields which will give the programmer more control over the website,” said Orgul. The founding members of P.A.C.T.F. aim to challenge their participants in a fun and creative way. They hope to establish their legacy and turn the competition into an annual occurrence.\n“We planned for [P.A.C.T.F.] to be an annual event, and it will come back next year. We think the entire experience of talking and finding sponsors and promoting the event of writing problems and working in a large team to execute something very student run, that is something we learned a lot from and we want other people to experience,” said Agarwal.\nIf you are interested in learning more about P.A.C.T.F, you can view their website at\xa0https://www.pactf.com/.\n\n', 'May 3, 2016'), ('\nAndover, Mass. — At 9:18 p.m. on Monday evening, Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, sent an email alerting the Andover community that a man with five outstanding warrants was believed to have run into the Cochran Bird Sanctuary.\n“The police believe that this individual ran into the Sanctuary,” wrote Elliott in the email. “He is wearing a gray hoodie and jeans; he is Hispanic, 36-years old and 5’4”… Do not go into the Sanctuary.”\nCourtesy of Andover Police DepartmentDeJesus has five outstanding warrants for his arrest.\nBoarding students were advised to return to their dormitories, and day students were asked to proceed to either the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library or George Washington Hall.\nThe Massachusetts State Police, in partnership with Phillips Academy Public Safety (PAPS) and the Andover Police Department (A.P.D.), sent a search helicopter above the Sanctuary, where it proceeded to circle for roughly an hour.

One member of the group, Vasu Sojitra, became the first person to ever summit the mountain on crutches.\nThis film was just one of the ten short films that were played last Saturday evening in Kemper Auditorium at the Explorer’s Club Adventure Film Festival. These ten films, ranging from three to 20 minutes each, were hand-selected by the Explorer’s Club, according to their poster, to “awe, stun, scare, and inspire their audience.”\nReed Findlay ’18, head of the Explorer’s Club, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I resurrected the club. My older brother started the club last year, and I picked it up out of the cracks this year because I really wanted to introduce to campus this idea of getting kids outdoors and active.”\nFindlay believes that students at Andover need to be educated in ways not typically offered in classroom environments or on sports teams.\n“Here at Andover, everyone’s a great student, and some people are great athletes, but you don’t see that kind of outdoor activity as much. So I wanted to bring to campus a club that could bring people together and do a passion that is not here on campus that much,” said Findlay.\nIn order to make his goal a reality, Findlay applied for and received an Abbot Grant for Explorer’s Club activities.\n“[The Abbot Grant] was for 1,450 dollars… We used a big chunk, 1,400 dollars, on renting films. The films are so expensive because that type of personal, inspiring adventure, they don’t just release it publicly. So 1,400 dollars went to renting the films… And 50 dollars just went towards marketing,” said Findlay. \nAudience members were inspired by the personal stories and journeys portrayed in the films. \nIsabelle Mead ’18 said, “It was really fascinating and enlightening to see all of the unique stories from all sorts of different people from multiple backgrounds and histories.”\nRomulus Sottile ’19 said, “I had a lot of fun [at the film festival].

She also emphasized the need for ocean exploration.\n“Almost 75 percent of the world is ocean, and you would be surprised even today we know less than 5 percent of [the ocean]… less than how much we know about the moon’s surface. It’s funny, because we always talk about how we are going to run out of resources and energy, then you realize actually that 95 percent of the world’s energy, resources, and platforms come directly from the ocean,” Bhattacharyya said during her presentation.\n“So the question here is that the ocean is right there when we go to holidays to see pretty beaches, but why can’t we explore the ocean much?” she continued.\nBhattacharyya mentioned that marine science remains mostly unexplored due to numerous limitation. She described how the current robot technology primarily consisting of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) is expensive and inaccessible to the public.\n“In the ocean, there are a bunch of things that just do not work. For example, radar signals. We can hear and receive data from Mars and from way out of the solar system whereas, in the ocean, you cannot send any high frequency data by radar waves, so GPS does not work… you can’t hear, you can’t really see well, and on top of it, communication – sending information –  is very hard,” said Bhattacharyya.\nBhattacharyya pitched the idea for her company in 2015, inspired to create autonomous smart drones that would overcome the environmental and financial difficulties of exploring and examining the ocean. She established Hydroswarm, a company that has been awarded numerous awards, namely the 2015 Mass Challenge, for its innovative ideas.\n“I am a rebel [and] I have always tried to find the hardest things to work with,” said Bhattacharyya in an interview with The Phillipian. “[I like to deal with] the things that make my life difficult.” \nSince its launch, Hydroswarm strives to design small and adjustable artificially intelligent technology that is capable of various functions while withstanding the intense pressure underwater. The smart drones will be applied to a wide variety of tasks that last from monitoring serious global issues such as oil and gas spills to personal leisure applications like taking automated pictures while people scuba dive.\nFor instance, Bhattacharyya proposed using her drones to find the Malaysian airplane that crashed two years ago. She advised that the attachment of a listening device could easily detect sound waves from the aircraft.\nClaudia Wessner, Acquisitions Librarian and Coordinator of The Nest, believes that Bhattacharyya’s topic will be informational and inspiring for many attendees.\nWessner said, “I think it definitely sets some light bulbs off people’s heads… Bringing in different professionals like [Bhattacharyya] can help people think of something that they would have never thought of.

The program revolves around each student’s chosen environmental project to help a local community of their choice. The program will be held for a week in the summer, followed up with bi-monthly meetings throughout the school year and then a final integration of the student’s project to the selected community. \nThe program was created by Mark Cutler, Instructor in Spanish, Co-Director of Outdoor Pursuits and Tang Institute Fellow.\n“It’s really about the intersection and the confluence of environment and culture,” Cutler said. “Your identity, your background, [and] your culture has very much to do with the ways that you interact with the environment. What we intend to do as we explore the environment is to come together culturally, interpersonally, and [to have] a global learning experience in the sense that we’re becoming a bit more informed global citizens and developing more empathy towards others.”\nThe program, with the guidance of Cutler, will be conducted by faculty members from Andover, Andover High School, Lawrence High School, Greater Lawrence Technical School, and Notre Dame Cristo Rey High School.\n“Because this is a collaboration between five schools, and specifically five schools that are distinct from each other and that have very different and unique populations and served different and unique populations, I think that this is going to be really exciting because everybody is going to bring what I call their ‘total identity’ to the project,” said Cutler. \n“Confluence,” an apt allusion to the juncture where two rivers join together, intends to truly inspire and cast a lasting effect on its participants by exposing them to the intersection of culture and environment.\nCarmen Muñoz-Fernandez, Instructor in Spanish and Learning in the World Coordinator, said, “In our Learning in the World  programs, it is very important that whatever you do in the field, when you come back, you bring that experience back to what you do here at [Andover] in different ways.” \n“It could be in your classes, it could be in a project for a class, or in an independent study… Basically that the experience doesn’t die where it happens,” continued  Muñoz-Fernandez.\n“Confluence” begins with a weeklong summer exploration of the Merrimack Valley. With exposure to kayaking, rock climbing, hiking, paddling, and other wilderness activities, the summer component of the program hopes to inform and inspire students in the pursuit of their yearlong environmental projects. \n“[Students] will go from point to point paddling and they will stop and do a bit of rock climbing – while at the same time, they will learn about our place, where we live, and ecology. Mostly, [students will learn about] building community and thinking about where we live in terms of the world and what it means to be a good global citizen,” said Muñoz-Fernandez.\nThroughout the school year, the participants of the program will further develop their environmental project with the guidance of their peers and program mentors.  \n“All of these projects will have an environmental theme. These are yearlong projects. We’d like to see these projects align themselves and the students to naturally gravitate towards something shared so that they collaborate on it,” said Cutler.\nFinally, the students will publicly present their projects.\nCutler, who has been a local to Andover his whole life, was driven to create a program where students could learn and explore both the world and themselves without embarking great distances.\n“Having been born and raised in this very area, I see that there is a lot of potential to have intercultural connections with people who represent a diverse world view and ethnic background, that we don’t need to travel so far to see,” said Cutler. \n“All the influences that you’ve had in your life will come and be part of this mix with everyone else.

I went to a summer program similar to Andover Summer Session when I was a high schooler, when I went to St. Paul’s in New Hampshire, and just loved the opportunity to try something totally different and experiment a little as a student without the pressure that comes with the regular session that I had for the school year.” \nFounded in 1942, Andover’s five-week Summer Session exposes 650 students from 54 countries to boarding school life and allows them to participate in a multitude of enrichment courses, according to the Andover website.\nIn addition to the summer program, Andover also runs four primary outreach programs that serve both the national and local community, including the Institute for Recruitment of Teachers, Andover Bread Loaf, (MS)2, and PALS.\nFriedman said, “Having been in a very high stakes world of education reform as a principal, I loved the idea of coming to meet people who are very interested, who want to learn without the pressure of standardized tests looming over their heads.”\nThe Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers is made up of a board of both students and faculty from Andover or externally. The program finds promising minority candidates interested in becoming teachers and provides them the training and experience necessary for both graduate school and the job market.\nAndover Bread Loaf helps students develop their critical and creative writing skills. The program is modeled after another program of the same name founded at Middlebury College in the 1920s and it caters to hundreds of local kids every year.  \n(MS)2 is aimed towards exposing underprivileged youths to more advanced topics in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. The program lasts three summers and takes place on campus.

The program also pairs them up with another student mentor whom they stay with for two years.\n“[Students who enroll in the program] receive some college access support as they go about applying to colleges because this is really designed to promote advanced students across the country and bring them together and give them what Andover can give them,” said Friedman.\nShe will replace Fernando Alonso, who served as the Director of Outreach and Summer Session but will take on the role of Dean of Administration and Finance at the start of summer.\n“I want to capitalize on all of the great things that have been done by Fernando Alonso and his team and all of the people who do Summer Session, (MS)2, and IRT and all of the summer programs,” said Friedman. “ I just want to get to know the way that things are run and also spend some time identifying really what’s the most effective, what could be improved… and then, eventually, look to think about ways that we can expand our impact, particularly through the outreach programs, and participate in the sort of education reform and initiatives that are going on in cities close by like Lawrence and Boston.”\n\n', 'Apr 22, 2016'), ('\nCasting a pink shadow over the budding grass, the cherry blossom tree stood in full bloom last Friday as students passed by all throughout the morning, stopping between classes to grab cookies and admire the tree.  \nThe cookies were placed on a table beneath the tree by Thomas Cone, Instructor in Biology and member of the Campus Beautification Committee. Cone has made this cookie day an annual tradition for ten to 15 years. \n“I love nature and I love wildlife on our campus. I try to encourage appreciation of wildlife, and the environment. The cherry tree is just an example that is something out here on our campus that is beautiful,” said Cone in an interview with The Phillipian. \nCone hopes to encourage more of the Andover community to admire and take in the natural beauty of campus, the cherry tree in particular. \n“[To] remind people of the beauty of something we have on the campus, I created this cookie festival around Earth Day… We pick a day when [the tree is] almost in full bloom, or it is in full bloom, when we’re all here… There are new students every year, and it’s great to have them all look at the tree and realize it’s there, and see the beautiful addition it is to campus,” said Cone. \n\nJP Tang ’18 stopped by the tree on Friday to take in the scene. \n“The tree makes me feel happy that it is spring,” said Tang. “The winter was very long and cold so it is nice to see flowers blooming again. It also reminded me of home, because I am from Hong Kong, which is a tropical area. I also think the trees look very nice and adds well onto the environment of our campus.”\nCone decided to create the cherry tree cookie day as a way to show appreciation for Andover’s natural beauty when the tree was threatened to be cut down. \n“I got involved with it because on two occasions, it was threatened to be cut down. One occasion was when it was very small, it was only about 12 feet high. This was about 45 years ago now. People driving by Day and Foxcroft couldn’t see the old science building, which was Evans Hall. A lot of people, students, faculty, and even some faculty wives came out and hugged the tree when they came to cut it down, so they didn’t. So the tree stayed,” said Cone.\nCone explained how later, after the Gelb Science Center was built in 2004, some Andover community members felt the cherry tree interfered with the campus sightline. \n“They argued that the tree should be cut down so that the science building could be seen better. So, it turned out that the architects came, and they liked it very much just the way it was, and they even took pictures from Foxcroft and they thought it was just very beautiful having the science building framed by this cherry tree. It was very beautiful and natural and they wanted to keep it, so it’s still with us now,” said Cone.\nFor years now, the cherry tree cookie day has served as an indication and celebration of spring and warm weather to many. \nKasey Welch ’16 has enjoyed the event for four years.\n“The beautiful blooming of the tree and the celebration of it with cookies,” said Welch, “is a great way to mark the beginning of spring and [Cone’s] excitement about it is infectious.

Means, the Means Essay Prize is awarded to an exceptional personal essay written by a student during the course of the school year, according to the prize description.\nVieira, Du, and Takyi shared their essays entitled “The City on a Hill,” “Cherry Pits,” and “In Theory,” respectively. \nVieira’s essay, “The City on a Hill,” centered upon the contrast between her family history of addiction and the seemingly pristine town of Andover where she grew up. Throughout her essay, Vieira explored these two aspects of her identity and came to terms with the fact that there was not a stark separation between the two, as she had previously thought.\n“I am from the blue-smoke, bottle-broke haze of addiction, and all its secret decorum. Each generation in my family has grappled with their own drug-fueled narrative, and while the vice of choice varies, the story’s trappings remain the same,” Vieira read during ASM.\nVieira was inspired to write her essay because of her family’s experience with addiction and the recent opioid crisis sweeping Massachusetts.\n“I felt like it was really fitting time to talk about my experiences with addiction and my experiences with my town, and how it’s perceived by the student body of Andover,” said Vieira in an interview with The Phillipian.\nIn “Cherry Pits,” Du examined the connections between her father’s desire to conceal his ethnic identity and her close friend’s struggle with his sexuality. Using the cherry pit as a metaphor, Du compared her observations to her younger self hiding cherry pits in the back of her mouth. \nDu read, “When my father tried to hide his Chinese accent he often reminded me of that cheeky, seven-year-old me trying to speak through a mouthful of cherry pits, like there was something in his mouth but he did not want anyone to know it was there… I was too young to understand xenophobia and homophobia and all the other phobias in the world, so all I knew was that his half-hidden accent sounded funny.” \nIn the writing process, Du first focused on her friend’s sexuality and identity, she said. Du’s cherry-pit metaphor came to her when she was reminiscing about when she hiked up a mountain and ate cherries with her friend. This was where Du’s friend revealed that he was gay. This scene on the mountain and the cherries emerged as a vehicle as she wrote more about individual moments in her friendship.\n“At first I didn’t have the metaphor in mind, but it just sort of took a life of its own and broadened my father’s story and it broadened so many stories, and all of a sudden it was all about the cherry pits,” said Du in an interview with The Phillipian.\nTakyi’s essay, “In Theory,” discussed the disconnect between the compliments directed at African-American women and girls and the way they are treated by others on the Andover campus.\n“I’m asking that we think critically about why we feel such a need to assure others that we value black girls through our words, when we and the systems around us are so reluctant to do so through action. I am not an aesthetic. Black women and girls are not an aesthetic. We are multifaceted and conflicted and intricate, and we deserve more than to be loved in theory,” read Takyi. \nTakyi in an interview with The Phillipian, “My freshman year, I remember our Means Essay [ASM] and it was so amazing. There was this one girl, Anna Stacy [’13], and she did just this amazing essay on her synesthesia. Afterward, I found her in the crowd and I was like, ‘That was so good! Can you please send me an email of that?’ And she did, and ever since then I’ve really wanted to do it myself.”\nAlthough Takyi had wanted to write a Means Essay since her Junior year, finding a topic did not come easily to her.\n“I was supposed to be writing and I struggled so hard with actually getting the words down, saying what I actually wanted to say, so I sort  of just said I wasn’t going to write it. That was where I was, and an hour before the deadline, I wrote it really quickly,” said Takyi.\nEnglish Teaching Fellows Andrea Acosta, Sofia Tirado, and Garrett Richie selected the three finalists from the 40 essays that were submitted and will choose this year’s Means Essay Prize winner based off of the declamations. \nTirado said, “I felt really honored to read so many deeply personal stories. We had so many powerful essays that it made the decision that much harder. There were definitely many factors at play when judging these essays. We looked both at the quality of writing and the impact of the story, although it’s near impossible to separate form and content. The essays we chose as finalists were not only well-written, but also shared an important message or story.”\nThe final winner will receive a prize of 150 dollars.\n\n', 'Apr 22, 2016'), ('\nNews Editors Annie Lee ’17 and Susan Yun ’17 sat down with Jane Goodall in an exclusive interview with\xa0The Phillipian.\n\n\n featured \n\n', 'Apr 15, 2016'), ('\nSurrounded by colorful class flags representing multiple generations of Abbot Academy alums, Erica Nork ’16 discussed Abbot Academy’s artistic and cultural influence on Andover during her Brace Fellowship presentation last Saturday. \nHeld in McKeen Hall on Abbot campus, Nork’s presentation attracted current students as well as many Abbot alumnae.\nNork wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “When I began my project, I wasn’t sure what angle I was going to take in focusing on Abbot Academy. I knew that ‘The Courant’ and Fidelio are reminiscent of Abbot, but I didn’t know much else. Eventually, in reading Abbot school-newspaper articles, I noticed just how incredibly prevalent the arts were there, and began to see how that culture of creativity permeated the school’s atmosphere.”\nDuring her presentation, Nork discussed Abbot Academy prior to its merger with Andover, second-wave feminism in the context of Abbot Academy, and the transition of Abbot Academy’s artistic legacy into Andover culture. \nNork, who is a four-year member of Chorus, a Producer for the DramaLabs, and a member of Andover Dance Group, said, “Much like my project focuses on Abbot Academy through the lens of the arts, my whole Andover experience has developed through that same lens… My experience has definitely honed me as an unapologetic advocate for empirical creativity and pursuit of the arts in the context of our strictly academic education. I think that’s what I do in the dance, theater, and music departments complements and gives more meaning to my academic work, and vice versa.”\nNancy Donnelly Bliss AA ’54 found the merger between Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy to be stronger than ever after its 40th anniversary. During Bliss’s time at Abbot, she was involved with the arts, singing in Fidelio and assisting in the Senior play. She is on the Abbot Alumnae Engagement Initiative and is also the Class of 1954 Secretary. \n“It was not easy to have one’s school change so radically and lose its identity, but it has been great that the Abbot Academy Association is so strong and that the Brace Center for Gender Studies is thriving. I believe the administration is supportive of the Abbot alums and understands the importance of keeping the Abbot name and spirit alive,” wrote Bliss in an email to The Phillipian.\nIn addition to Bliss, Nork also had the opportunity to speak to other Abbot alumnae who had varying impacts on Nork and her presentation. \n“I thoroughly enjoyed getting to talk to [Abbot alumnae]. All of the alumnae I talked to were incredibly smart and inspiring women. I only got to meet one alumna in person prior to my presentation, but I talked to a few on the phone and emailed many. The alumna I did get to meet in person, Sandy Rollins ’71, let me come and interview her at her house in Boston, and I had so much fun talking with her both about Abbot [Academy] and about her life as a curator of historical collections across the state,” said Nork in an email to The Phillipian.\nThrough her research, Nork came to appreciate the importance that a community for gender-based research like the Brace Center exists. \nLizzie McGonagle ’16, a friend of Nork and fellow dancer, said, “I think that the Brace Center is a really great platform to have a part of the institution that is endorsed by faculty that are really devoted to talking about these issues,” in an interview with The Phillipian. \nUnlike most Brace fellows, Erica’s interest in Abbot Academy arts did not stem directly from the Brace center.\n“My Brace Fellowship actually started out as my History 310 Paper – simply writing about Abbot Academy and the arts. I was so excited with the research and the sheer breadth of material in the Archives, that I wanted to continue and expand my project,” said Nork in an email to The Phillipian.\nNork’s presentation expressed her belief for the importance of the arts and relayed the influence that Abbot Academy has on the Andover community today.\n“I spent a lot of time exploring in the Archives, looking through old ‘Courant’s and Abbot school newspapers. Luckily, a lot of material had already been digitized, so I was able to find things like old yearbooks and Courants online. I guess my process consisted mostly of perusing articles, as well as diving into secondary sources about the feminist context of the ’60s and ’70s,” Nork continued. \nDirected by Tasha Hawthorne and Flavia Vidal, the Brace Center for Gender Studies is an academic resource center where students and faculty work together on gender-based projects.\nA series of plays written Abbot alumnae supplemented Nork’s presentation.

They were given a finite amount of time to complete the activity in five design-thinking stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.\n“It’s going to be really fast paced. You’re not going to feel like you have time to perfect all the steps. That’s going to be part of it,” said Godine before beginning the activity.\nIn the first two stages, pairs interviewed each other to determine what their partner was looking for in their ideal homes. The general questions posed were about the location, purpose, and activities the client wished to engage in these homes.\nIn the following two stages, partners sketched sample homes and discussed the methods of improvement. Eventually, a final design was determined. In the last stage, pairs attempted to create a 3-D model of their homes using only paper, paper clips, scissors, and tape.\nDarcy Burnham ’18, an attendee of Godine’s workshop, said, “I really liked how much he emphasized the importance of getting feedback from your customer. The stages included several conversations with the [clients] to get a deep understanding of what [they] want. In addition, I loved how, during the prototyping stage, he advised us to not get attached to one specific design, but instead create multiple designs and combine the best features of each.” \nThough a little more complicated in reality, Godine and fellow members of Getaway follow a similar process when designing actual tiny houses.\nThus far, Getaway has designed and manufactured three tiny houses outside of Boston. Each house offers an escape from the chaos of everyday life.\n“Our tiny houses are located in the woods, so it’s nice for people to get away from the urban grind. They actually have limited cell phone service, so you really do feel separated from work and other social distractions, or whatever else it may be, and all your social media feeds,” said Godine in his presentation.\nWhile the tiny houses are only about 160-square-feet large, they offer all the necessities provided by larger homes.\n“They all offer a kitchen, a place for at least two people to sleep, some kind of eating area, electricity [and a] hot shower,” said Godine.\nMost clients stay in the tiny houses for one to two nights. Getaway is already 80 percent to 90 percent booked through the summer.\n“I think the majority of clients are in one of two camps: either it’s a couple from the city looking to get away, maybe on a romantic weekend. The other client [groups are] people who are really interested in tiny house living and want to test it out,” said Godine.\nIn addition to its three existing tiny houses, Getaway plans to continue expanding.\n“Getaway is expanding to New York state next. The houses will be located near New York City, and I think there are plans in the works to make some in San Francisco as well,” said Godine.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Apr 15, 2016'), ('\nWilliam Hamilton ’58, a cartoonist for “The New Yorker,” passed away on afternoon of April 8, 2016 when his car was struck by another vehicle. He was 76.\nFamous for his distinctive combination of caricature and realism, as well as his tendency to provide commentaries of high society, Hamilton began his industrious career as a cartoonist drawing illustrations for The Phillipian and Pot Pourri during his time at Andover. In 1965, he began working at “The New Yorker” and stayed there until his death.\nIn addition to his work at “The New Yorker,” Hamilton was also a novelist and playwright. His collection of written work features many of the same critiques of high society as his cartoons. He has written four plays, “Save Grand Central” (1976), “Plymouth Rock” (1977), “Happy Landings” (1982), and “White Chocolate” (2004), as well as three novels, “The Love of Rich Women” (1980), “The Charlatan” (1985), and “The Lap of Luxury” (1988).\nHamilton developed a love for drawing at a young age, submitting cartoons to major newspapers by the age of 12. David Othmer ’59, who worked with Hamilton on The Phillipian as a Managing Editor, recalls Hamilton’s love of art. \n“He was constantly doodling, constantly drawing. What became his career was something that started long before it was a career. He would be in any situation, whether it be at Commons, in a classroom, or outside, and he would capture the essence of the situation in a cartoon kind of way, and it would be very funny,” said Othmer in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\n“He would have that artistic ability to capture the moment, and the sense of humor that made it humorous,” Othmer said.\nOthmer continued, “He had a very acute sense of the irony of life, even then, and that sense of irony and poking fun at people just continued on throughout his life. His cartoons were identifiable not only by the style of drawing but by the emotions being conveyed and the situations being depicted. [The subjects] were all stuffy, high-society white people. He was always poking fun at the establishment, and he did it very cleverly.”\nAfter graduating from Andover, Hamilton attended Yale University, and then served with the Army in Alaska from 1963 to 1965. Hamilton employed his skills as a cartoonist while writing his application to the university.\nOthmer said, “One of the standard questions on all the applications back then was ‘Why do you want to go to this school?” It was three pages. On the first page [of Hamilton’s application], there was a drawing of a dandy in a straw hat, and the caption underneath was ‘I can’t go to Princeton.’ On the second page, there was a drawing of a hippie with a scraggly beard, all dirty and disheveled, and the caption was ‘I can’t go to Harvard.’ The third page was a blank page with just a caption: ‘So I guess I have to go to Yale.’ That was his application to Yale.”\nHamilton was born June 2, 1939, in Palo Alto, Calif., to Alexander Hamilton and Ellen Ballentine.

Social media brings us activism, it inspires activism. It informs us, it educates us, it connects us in so many ways. These are positive things. And it creates community… Social media has saved lives,” said Pierce during the presentation.\n“When we’re behind social media, we are somewhat disconnected. We think we’re connected, but we’re actually disconnected… [Social media] creates envy. It adds to the stress in your life, even though you know in your head these people are cultivating their image,” she continued.\nPierce encouraged audience members to continue developing in-person interactive skills in place of social media.\n“So many people are hooking up behind text. Everyone’s got a lot more swagger and courage behind text… but we need to be face-to-face where we can practice reading social cues, non-verbal cues, verbal language, what you’re saying with your eyes. But if we’re not getting practice with that, we’re not developing [those skills],” said Pierce.\nPrior to starting work in motivational speaking, Pierce ran an inn with her husband, with whom she has three children. Her introduction to giving speeches was a complete accident.\nPierce said, “[After talking to me,] my friend’s boss said they were like ‘Woah, you make us feel so much better about being women, having vaginas, birthing, and relationships. You make it funny and we’re struggling with [these things], could you get on stage and do that?’ ”\nIn 2004, Pierce agreed to the suggestions from her peers and family. Originating from a small scale comedy show, she delighted crowds with a straightforward, blunt style of humor that simultaneously provided audience members with advice in social situations. \n“I thought [the younger] generation with Internet didn’t really need any information on orgasms and all this, and I went to a sorority, and I kind of vaguely talked about [the first time I orgasmed,] and then one woman behind me said, ‘Excuse me, you talked about that but you didn’t actually tell us how you do that,’ ” said Pierce.\nIn her presentation, Pierce also touched upon the topic of affirmative consent.\n“You are a group that talks about affirmative consent. I just want you to understand that this is a policy on campus. You are going to be better than your parents at this… because you have started younger. Affirmative consent is very basic,” said Pierce. \nPierce has been featured on the list of “14 Remarkable Women of the Arts” in “New Hampshire” magazine.

There’s a pretty diverse group of political views in the class and he had fairly strong political views and so I’m not sure everyone agreed with him politically, but at the same time he was very friendly and very willing to discuss things,” said Wintman. \nJennifer Savino, Director of Alumni Engagement, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “[Poliquin’s visit was] a wonderful opportunity to connect current students to other alumni across the decade and to have an alumnus come to a class that directly connects his job and service to our country.” \nPoliquin represents the 2nd District of Maine in the United States House of Representatives.

If we don’t act soon, it will be too late. For [the] future, that’s pretty grim. So I come and try and spread our program through Roots & Shoots as much as I possibly can. That’s why I come: to galvanize young people to roll up your sleeves and get out there and help us make the world a better place,” said Goodall in an interview with The Phillipian.\nGoodall’s passion for environmentalism and zoology began at a young age. In her speech, Goodall recalled her fascination with the chickens on her grandmother’s farm and also credited her mother for encouraging her enthusiasm for learning.\n“I began asking everybody, ‘Where does the egg come out of the hen?’… Nobody answered me to my satisfaction, [and so] what I do remember so vividly is seeing a hen, going up into her little sleeping house… and going into an empty hen house and waiting and waiting and waiting,” said Goodall in her presentation.\nMeanwhile, her family had been worried as Goodall was nowhere in sight while she was watching the hen lay an egg, returning home well after sundown. Instead of getting angry at Goodall, her mother supported her curious nature and provided her with the necessary resources to support her interest.\n“Isn’t that the making of a little scientist: the curiosity, asking questions, not getting the right answers, deciding to find out for yourself, making a mistake, not giving up, and learning patience? It was all there in that 4½-year-old little girl. And a different kind of mother might have crushed that scientific curiosity and I might not be standing here. She [even] decided that I would learn to read more quickly if she got books that were about animals,” said Goodall.\nDuring her 55-year study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, Goodall initially had trouble bonding with the primates. Funds for her research were running low, and Goodall was worried that she would have to return to England before she had made any significant discoveries.\n“Those were the early days that were very frustrating and worrying for me… The chimpanzees took one look at this peculiar white ape and ran away. They’ve never seen anything like this before, and they were very conservative. So I was really worried that the money would run out before I seen anything really exciting and that would be the end of the whole thing,” said Goodall in her presentation.\nWith support from her mother, she continued her research and eventually earned the trust of a male chimpanzee after he began to steal bananas from Goodall’s table who Goodall later named David Greybeard. After she had bonded with David Greybeard, she began to earn the trust of his family.\n“Gradually [the chimpanzees] began to lose their fear, and gradually I came to know them as distinct individuals looking very different one from another. As the years passed, the understanding of chimpanzee behavior began to be easier. I can now look back 55 years [and] we still have family research station at Gombe, [and] we still have students working there – local Tanzanians, as well as those from overseas. And if I look back, the thing that is most striking is how [similar to] us they are,” said Goodall in her presentation. \nIn addition to her fieldwork and activism, Goodall has authored more than 20 books and has received over 70 awards for her research on primates. She has served on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project since its foundation in 1996 and is currently an ambassador for Disneynature. \nAs a philanthropist, Goodall is inspired by the research and activism conducted by new generations of scientists and environmentalists. Goodall hopes Andover students will realize the difference they can make in preserving the world we live in. \n“I think the most important message is that every single individual makes a difference every single day, and [for] you [to] start thinking about the consequences of what you buy, what you eat, what you wear, how you interact with people or the environment or animals. [It] may seem to you that, ‘It’s just me so it won’t make any difference,’ but in our Roots & Shoots program and other youth programs of a similar nature… you find that if everybody starts making ethical choices, you start leaning towards the kind of world that we hope to create or to restore,” said Goodall in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Apr 15, 2016'), ('\nAi-jen Poo ’92 is the recipient of this year’s Fuess Award and will be presenting during All-School Meeting on Wednesday, April 27. \nThe Fuess Award was established in 1964 in honor of Andover’s tenth Headmaster Claude Moore Fuess, and it is given to alumni who have embodied the spirit of Non Sibi by committing themselves to public service.\nWhat is the talk going to be about?\nI’m still working it out, but I think it’ll be about the challenges and opportunities ahead for this generation of Andover students to really shape the future of our safety net and our policy to transform inequality and create a better life in America.\nHow did your time at Andover shape the path your career has followed?\nI had some really great teachers who really encouraged me to think creatively and to think critically about the status quo, and to try to imagine a future where inequality and inequities don’t exist in the same way. I had creative writing teachers who really encouraged a level of imagination of a different kind of future based on love and equality and equity and dignity, a lot of the values that I think the Non Sibi principle is really about. I did a lot of community service where I was exposed to what it means to serve communities that are very different from the ones that you know, and I was also exposed to literature and history classes and teachers who really encouraged me to learn from the tragedies and the mistakes of the past in order to create a future where we increasingly become more whole and more unified as a country. \nSpeaking specifically about community service, was there any particular assignment that really spoke to you or inspired you?\nI was in the student environmental group, and we were active on all kinds of projects – I think it was called Earth Friends. I was also in the Women’s Forum where we organized events that were highlighting the need for gender equality. I also did service in Lowell at a childcare center in a refugee community. All of those experiences, they really meant a lot to me to think critically about different forms of inequality and different ways that we can be living our lives in such a way to promote more sustainable ways of living, more sustainable communities, more sustainable economic relationships. I think it really did strike me, as I was working at the childcare center in Lowell, how growing up in a poor community really affects everything about life. The food you eat, the opportunities you have, the neighborhood you live in – all of it is incredibly connected to the messages and the support you receive to be able to realize your full potential as a child. I think it really gave me a different perspective on what it means to create economic opportunity. \nYou were named by “Women Deliver” as one of 100 women from across the globe who is advocating for other women, and you have been featured in the “40 Under 40” list in “Feminist Press.” Why are women’s rights important to you and how do they influence your work?\nWomen play a really unique role in our society now. Women are more than half of all college graduates, more than half of the work force, 70 percent of the consumer market, more than half of the electorate. We are incredibly powerful in terms of what we’re driving in the economy and in political and civic life in this country. And yet, oftentimes we’re underrepresented in positions of power and influence, and overrepresented in positions of vulnerability and instability. I think that that gender inequality is at the heart of so much of what needs to transform in our society in order for us to realize our full potential. The president even said this. He said that when women succeed, America succeeds, and I think I would go even further to say when the least visible women in our economy are able to succeed, then we will know that we’ve fully achieved real economic opportunity in this country. I do believe that when you look at the world through the eyes of women, you see both the challenges and the problems more completely, and you also see the solutions more clearly. That’s why I’ve continued to do work with women, and have really tried to develop the leadership of women, particularly women of color to lead in this country. \nWhat motivated you to center your work around the rights of domestic workers?\nIt’s similar, I think, looking at the realities for women. It’s because domestic work is historically associated with women’s work – and particularly women of color – as a form of paid work. I think that it’s been so devalued and undervalued. It’s the kind of work that’s not even considered real work. It’s called “help” and “companionship” and so whether you’re doing it as a family member, unpaid, or you’re doing it as a professional, it’s just been made so invisible in our economy, and yet it’s such an important part of how our economy functions. I often ask people what it would be like if all the nannies and housekeepers and healthcare workers decided not to go to work one day, and therein is the reality that we’re all so dependent on this work. It’s the work that makes all of the work possible, and yet has been so devalued, and I think that that’s a huge and invisible part of transforming inequality in this country, and to make sure that it’s valued. It’s one of these examples that if you look at the world through the eyes of women, you see these different leverage points for creating equity and opportunity that you might not see otherwise.\nWhat duties does your work as a labor organizer and a director entail? \nIt means that I run an organization that advocates for the domestic workforce and caregivers. I help develop strategies that change policy, change culture, change the protections as a quality of these jobs, and a lot of that, on a day to day level, means recruiting people, raising awareness, and raising funds to support the work.\nWhat do you consider your greatest accomplishment?\nCreating a national organizational voice for [domestic workers] that has been underrepresented and invisible for so long. \nWhat advice do you have for current Andover students who may be considering careers in political advocacy and social justice?\nI would say, get involved in a movement or an organization. Whether it’s on campus or in the community, and to work first at the grassroots level. A lot of people say all politics is local, and I would say to start where you consider yourself to be at home, and then to build from there and to just dive in. There’s no substitute for the practice and the learning that comes from doing. \nWhat’s in the future for you and your organization?\nWe really want to shape the safety net in such a way that young people today have both stability and flexibility, they have both opportunity and the ability to raise their families with lots of support, and really change the way this company thinks and feels about care in particular so that everyone has the ability to care for their loved ones and work and realize their dreams in all these different ways.\n\n', 'Apr 15, 2016'), ('\nJayshawn Fuller and Hannah Berkowitz: Abbot\nWhy did you two decide to run for cluster co-presidents?\nFuller: So this is my second year on cluster council. Last year I was the dorm representative for Carriage House. This year, I am the social functions head and it’s been [a] really great experience getting involved in Abbot. Everyone here as we mentioned in our platform, is so spirited and so enthusiastic. Wanting to be a part of that and [making] Abbot a place where everyone wants to be and somewhere where everyone wants to stay. Certainly that was the thing that motivated me.\nBerkowitz: I [have] a similar thing – we just love the spirit here, and we thought that we were the people to get [things] done.\nWhat made you guys decide to run together and how did you guys meet?\nBerkowitz: Well, he says we met in this awesome class we took together, but I am sure we met before that. I asked Jayshawn if he wanted to run with me because we were in [a] class together, and everything he said sounded really intelligent and interesting. I thought he was a really nice guy, and he lived in Abbot.\nFuller: She was really funny, and she had a great personality. I thought she would be perfect for representing Abbot, and all the spirit that she would bring in that aspect [would be] great.\nWhat are your main goals for the term? What do you hope to accomplish?\nBerkowitz: My biggest and [most] favorite thing on my platform is getting to assign a charity to every cluster next year. [I also look forward to] making more cluster events and doing fun [munches and] games. That should be a really great hit.\nFuller: For me, because I have lived in Abbot for all three years, and I’ve seen many of my friends leave… my biggest goal is working [on making] Abbot a place for people to really feel the aspect of community – really to make the walk worth it.\nMalika Dia and David Kwon: Pine Knoll\nWhat do you think is the most important quality for someone in your position or in student government?\nKwon: I think honesty is the best quality that needs to be used if you are running for any student position. Because the whole goal [of] you running is to show your ideas and [saying] what you want to accomplish, even if you don’t accomplish them, you still want to try as best you can to do so. You also want to be honest and open about that.\nDia: I think open-mindedness is good – just being someone that is driven. But if you are too fixated on one specific idea, it’s very hard to listen to others and incorporate others’ ideas into yours to make them better. So, I think one of the things very important in this position, just in general really, [is] taking the time to listen to others ideas, work well with others and not be too strong-headed because other pope have a lot to share.\nHow did you meet your running mate?\nKwon: I don’t actually remember how I met her. I don’t actually think there was one specific moment that we remember. It might have been a cluster munch or maybe the new student orientation… Malika is an amazing, funny, honest, but [also] responsible person, and I would say… that she is the better half of our co-presidency. So when I was thinking about who to run with, she was my first choice.\nDia: This is a really great opportunity because I’m really good friends with him… I think being good friends helps a lot but I [also] think our personalities work well together. We are sort of opposites but it creates a very equal dynamic.\nSusan Yun and Robert Williams: Flagstaff\nWhy did you two decide to run for cluster co-presidents?\nYun: Robert and I were working as Social Functions Heads for the past year, and we both kind of thought that using our experiences, we would make pretty good cluster co-presidents. It was something that I always admired. I’m good friends with Sloane [Sambuco] ’16, and I saw how she developed her cluster co-presidency, how she became more of a leader in the Andover community, and that’s something that I could see myself doing.\nWilliams: So when I came as a new Lower last year, I became really good friends with Amanda [Krakauer] ’15, the Cluster President at that time, and we became really close during orientation. So I began helping her clean up after and set up munches, and I became really involved in the cluster. So when I became really close with Mr. Hession, I [already] felt pretty invested in the cluster, and for me, coming from a small school, it [was] important [to] give back to this cluster that has given me so much.\nWhat do you think is the most important quality for a president to have?\nYun:  I definitely think having good leadership qualities, being able to speak publicly, being able to understand those around you, having compassion and being able to listen to your peers [are all important]. If [students] have any issues or problems that they wanted to talk to you about, being able to implement those ideas and having a good relationship with the administration.\nWilliams: I think besides the obvious ones like being a role model and being a standard bearer if you will, I think communication is really important serving as a student leader… so being able to know the people in your cluster and being able to know who you’re serving while at the same time being able to effectively communicate with the administration.\nEditor’s note: Susan Yun is a News Editor for The Phillipian.\nAlexander Emerson and Alexandria Ma: West Quad North\nWhat do you think are the most important qualities for a cluster co-president?\nMa: We both really wanted to be cluster [presidents] who were approachable and more involved in cluster activities and events. [We also] really wanted to get to know each and every person in our cluster because we wanted to foster a sense of community and pride.\nEmerson: We’re both prefects this year so we wanted to take the mentality [of student leaders] and open that up to the whole cluster. Just be there for everybody in the cluster.\nWhat are your main objectives for your term?\nMa: We have two main objectives on our platform and they’re both kind of fostering this sense of community. The first one is making the cluster [a] home for every single student. So it could be [for] day students, new students, and making sure that everybody is really welcome. Our second one is cluster pride, which we think West Quad North is lacking a little bit.\nWhat do you think is special about your cluster?\nEmerson: I think West Quad North is kind of the best of both worlds. It’s separated enough from campus that you kind of have a distinct line between work and home. So you get your school work during the day and then you can go home to your dorm. But then it’s also not too far.  I think that’s one of the greatest things about West Quad North. We also have this beautiful quad in the middle. I think that space isn’t used as much as it could be. That’s another couple of things on our platform. We’re going to try to foster use of the quad a little more.\nWill Nuga and Laurel Wain: West Quad South\nWill Nuga and Laurel Wain\nWhy did you two decide to run for cluster co-presidents?\nWain: I wanted to run because I’ve been on cluster council for two years and I really like being involved with the cluster. I had a really good relationship with Ms. Dolan, so I wanted to continue that [relationship with her].\nNuga: I wanted to run because I’ve never been in an official position here at Andover. Especially as an Upper, I only have a year left here, so [I thought that I] might as well try new things out.\nWhat do you think are the most important qualities for a cluster co-president?\nWain: I think you should [have] good communication skills because you need to be communicating  between the cluster dean and also your peers. Then, confidentiality because you’re also involved with DCs.\nNuga: Also, a general sense of responsibility. You have to be very alert, and you have to be able to take care of all of the [duties] that [are] required in that position.\nWhat are your main objectives for your term?\nWain: [In] our platform, we have [proposals] like hosting a dance on the quads, [starting] a scooter rental system and most importantly, [getting] a West Quad South geotag for Snapchat. I don’t know, I think there’s been a lot of buzz about West Quad South this past year and we kind of wanted to—\nNuga: —make West Quad South great again.\nWain: Yeah, stray away from that stigma a little bit and get everyone back on track.\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nSince coming to Andover, Emma Goldstein ’09 held the Andover motto Non Sibi close to heart. After graduating, Goldstein continued to pursue her interest in serving the community through campaigning for multiple Senators and holding several positions in government.\nGoldstein started out campaigning in 2013 when when newly-appointed Secretary of State John Kerry resigned as Massachusetts State Senator and a special election was held to fill the vacant senate seat. At the time, Goldstein was involved as a student and worked on the senate campaign in Andover. It was only shortly after graduating from Tufts University with a double major in community health and American studies that Goldstein became more involved in the local New England political scene.\n“I graduated from Tufts and it was right at the time when John Kerry was appointed as Secretary of State and I decided [that I wanted to be] doing some political stuff that I had not done any of it in college… I decided that to be a political person I needed to help out with the campaign,” said Goldstein.\nShortly after working for Senator Kerry, Goldstein packed her bags and headed further south of Massachusetts to help campaign for Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Goldstein was eventually interviewed for the position of Massachusetts Deputy Director of Boards and Commissions.\nAt the end of Governor Patrick’s term Goldstein left her position due to the mandatory turnover of state executive office positions. Goldstein was looking for a new job when she was recommended to work under Mayor Walsh.\n“It was just a really exciting place to be. Mayor Walsh was a genuine guy, and he was a genuine mayor. There was a good feeling about the mayor’s office,” said Goldstein.\nGoldstein also found that working in city government was much more personal level than in state government.\n“What is really exciting about city government is that it is the government that you interact with every single day. It is everything from your trash being collected, to your public schools… that all falls into city government. It is an exciting space [because] you are able to be so impactful… That to me, that function of municipal government, felt meaningful so I was attracted to it,” said Goldstein.\nGoldstein was not sure of what direction she wanted to pursue throughout her career; however, she always wants to be in a place where people were driven by a common mission.\n“I knew that when I was looking for a job, I knew it had to be in a place that had a mission. I believed in the values of Governor Patrick. [Working with Governor Patrick] ended up being a really great opportunity and I got to work with really great people… I worked for a politician that I really believed in,” said Goldstein.\nShe hopes that in the future that she will continue to have a mission no matter if it is within the government, with a nonprofit, or for a private company.\n“I am excited because I feel like there are so many different types of things I could be doing in my future. I would have never guessed that I would be doing the type of work I am doing now and I can’t wait to see what is next,” said Goldstein in an email interview with The Phillipian.\nAs an Andover student Goldstein reported for The Phillipian, held the title of President of the Jewish Student Union (JSU), and was involved in Andover’s office of Community and Multicultural Development.\n“I have always been interested in how people get along and how people work together, and I wanted to be part of some community that I could be a part of,” said Goldstein in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\n“In [JSU] it was making sure that Jewish students had a good place on campus to talk about issues or Jewish holidays and with The Phillipian it was about creating a resource for our community and having a source for what was going on at campus,” she continued.\nFor Andover students, Goldstein also hopes that they will take advantage of the opportunities offered to them while they can.\n“At Andover, the spectacular was seen as unspectacular; you could have this opportunity one night to hear a U.S. Senator speak, and then the next night you could hear internationally renowned author. In one week you have five opportunities to see and interact with – on a real level – really amazing people,” said Goldstein.\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nAfter a brief encounter with David Fricke, Sports Information Director, in New York City, Dr. Moustafa Bayoumi, a writer and a professor of English at Brooklyn College, was invited to Andover last Thursday evening to speak. In his presentation titled “This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror and the Presidential Election,” Bayoumi shared what it means to be Muslim-American in modern U.S. society, post-9/11.\n“There’s a cliché that says ‘you only write the book that you want to read,’ and I think that was the case. A lot of these [racial] issues I find important, partly because they impact me personally but also because they are very important politically for the health of our society. I don’t see them discussed often enough, so I feel as if I don’t see it then someone else has to do it, so I try,” said Bayoumi in an interview with The Phillipian. In his presentation, Bayoumi addressed the impact that the attacks of September 11, 2001 had on views towards Muslims in the U.S.\n“Before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in 2001, I think it’s fair to say that a lot of Americans thought very little of Islam. When they thought about Islam, they always thought about it happening someplace else… After 9/11, that drastically changed. By the time [we] were reaching 2008, and especially 2010, [we] were reaching about 48% of the population [saying] that they personally [harbored] prejudice against Muslims,” said Bayoumi in his presentation.\nBayoumi witnessed his colleagues and students at Brooklyn College being spied upon by the New York City Police Department (NYPD). This program spied on members of the Muslim community, including Bayoumi, regardless of whether or not they had any ties to terrorism.\n“[The NYPD] had been, in fact, spying on every level of community life. It wasn’t just that they were spying on people involved with some illegal procedure; it wasn’t that somebody’s behavior was determining this level of surveillance. It was actually a generalized surveillance along the whole stretch of the Muslim community,” said Bayoumi.\n“Often times, we are told that if we are not doing anything wrong, there shouldn’t be anything to fear. But despite not doing anything wrong, despite living a very clear life, there is this fear that people will take what you say out of context,” continued Bayoumi.\nBayoumi expanded his point by comparing the associations of Muslims as terrorists to the accusations of communism among the American public during the Cold War era. From the way the media spread paranoia of communism to the legal and political systems both reforming the mindset of Americans toward one another, Bayoumi explained their similarities.\nZizo Bahnasy ’17, an audience member at Bayoumi’s lecture and the co-head of Muslim Student Association and Middle East North African Association on campus, reflected on Bayoumi’s presentation.\n“He gives me hope – you don’t [often] see Muslims who go out of their way to be a part of this assimilated American culture because they feel so foreign to it. I feel as if I can tackle these issues as a result of people like Dr. Bayoumi… He is going out and putting [facts and statistics] together and making sure people understand Muslims are not the problem,” said Bahnasy.\nBayoumi concluded his lecture with a question and answer session. During this time, he re-addressed the themes discussed throughout his lecture.\n“I hope that [audience members] walk away thinking a little bit more critically [about] this War on Terror that we are living in right now. [I hope] they’ll have a little more perspective [in] the presidential election as well, and [also] think about the role that the United States plays in the world,” said Bayoumi in an interview with The Phillipian.\nBayoumi is the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\n“I’m that lame adult that you really don’t want to friend,” said danah boyd, social media scholar and principal researcher at Microsoft Research, in her talk discussing youth social networks last Thursday evening.\nboyd, who styles her name with lowercase letters, is the founder of research institute Data and Society and author of “It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens.” She came to Andover to speak about her work using the internet to map cultural progress and trying to understand it as a whole. Her talk focused on how young people navigate social media and the cultural implications of those social systems.\n“I was online at a time when there were very few people online and it certainly wasn’t cool. For me, it was an escape valve to get out of my environment because it was an opportunity to connect with people from around the globe,” boyd said in an interview with The Phillipian.\nboyd finds her interactions with social media have shaped the way she observes modern youth culture.\n“For me, for social media, it’s also about my friends, it’s also about my community, and I use Twitter in the most lame, adult way possible which is to broadcast. That’s the reality of it. I wish I was cooler, but I’m really not, my world is filled with kids’ pictures,” said boyd.\nWorking as an ethnographer for the past ten years, boyd studies customs of individual groups of people and cultures. Her research is largely based on a combination of qualitative analysis from quantitative data.\n“The interesting thing about my work is that because I’m an ethnographer, I spend a lot of time embedded within communities. The questions I can answer are fundamentally descriptive, about trying to understand trends and patterns. But I also have a background in computer science, and one of the things I spent a lot of my time doing in the early stages of my field work were analyzing and randomly sampling across huge amounts of data sets,” said boyd in her presentation.\nAlthough a researcher in social media, boyd finds social media to have both positive and negative cultural impacts.\n“[Social media] is simultaneously a way that allows you to connect and have so many more opportunities than we’ve ever had to socialize, to do a variety of things. And it can also be very costly. A lot of it comes down to how it fits in your community and in your world, and I think that’s what makes it tricky,” said boyd in an interview.\nboyd’s research has led her to further examine the collection of data in the context of social justice. In particular, boyd cited “Spit and Acquit,” a DNA collection program based in Orange County, Calif.\n“For a lot of minorities in Orange County, [local law enforcement] made a deal: They wouldn’t be charged [for traffic violations] in return for turning over genetic material. And so what we are seeing is the development of large databases primarily of black and brown individuals across this country pulled in for genetic material as a way of understanding their entire social structure,” said boyd.\nboyd’s work in criminal justice has led her to research data accessibility in search engines as well.\n“When people search for black names in the United States, they are far more likely to click on criminal justice related advertisements, particularly because we have a lot of racist assumptions in the United States about why somebody’s name might appear that way…Google is not trying to be racist, but it learns society’s racism and feeds it right back at us,” said boyd.\n“The systems and the dynamics that we see around us are actually fueled by a whole set of interactions that go outside of your own decisions and your own value systems but start to pull in the value systems of many other people,” boyd continued.\nboyd also addressed the connections between cyberbullying and drama over social media during her talk.\nboyd further discussed how a teenger’s potential experience with cyberbullying may be a part of a larger theme in the context of their individual worlds.\n“[Young people] understand a lot of their experience through the language of drama and the importance of drama is that it doesn’t position them as a perpetrator or a victim, it positions them as having agency with a huge and complex social dynamic,” said boyd. “It doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, but it means every bullying intervention we go after completely misses the point because a lot of how their dealing with it and experiencing the different dynamics is a series of social dramas that get played out as they try to make sense of the world.”\nboyd currently works at Microsoft Research, New York University Media Culture & Communication, and the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet & Society.\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nStarting this academic year, there will no longer be a cluster lottery for Juniors. Instead of having priority in dorms within their respective cluster, all Juniors, excluding those deciding to triple or stack, will enter the all-school housing lottery.\nPreviously, Juniors who wished to stay in their cluster had the option of entering a cluster-based lottery; the students already in their desired cluster were given priority over dorms in that cluster.\nRaj Mundra, Assistant Dean of Students, said, “The new process is that, as in years past, there are triples available for Juniors, and also stacks available for Juniors to bid on. The only thing that we are shifting is the cluster preference [to remove] that middle step where students had preference to stay within their cluster before the Junior all-school lottery.”\nMundra continued, “There are reasons about why we have moved away from that including the most prominent, the most clear, is fairness. And we felt that [in] different clusters, ninth grade boarding students in different clusters did not have the same type of options for housing going into tenth grade within their clusters. And we thought that that was not fair.”\nThe decision to eliminate in-cluster priority for ninth graders has been an ongoing topic of discussion between the Dean of Students Office and other members of the Andover campus.\nMundra said, “This has been a conversation for many years in the Dean of Students office.  Ultimately it is the Dean of Students office that have made this decision; that is the cluster deans, Ms. Elliott and myself. We have spoken to many ninth grade house counselors and to students also, who have gone through the system.”\nWhile this new policy affects rising tenth graders, it will not change the housing process for rising 11th and 12th graders.\nMartha Fenton, Dean of West Quad North Cluster, said, “We are pretty unique as a school in the variety of our dorms, and the cluster system makes us even more unique… I think the variety works really well for our student body.”\nTheodore Parker, Dean of Abbot Cluster, said “We’re constantly reevaluating the housing process, trying to make it as equitable as possible and inclusive as possible.”\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nUnder the watchful eyes of student mentors, small clusters of students worked for hours in The Nest on Friday and Saturday to solve problems related to time in Andover’s first ever hackathon, Hack Andover.\nTeams of about 6-8 people were given the single word prompt “time” and had 24 hours to present a solution to a related problem that would improve students’ lives at Andover, using the prototyping tools the NestEd had to offer. The event was planned by John Koobatian ’17 and Darius Lam ’17, and sponsored by The Nest, the Tang Institute, and M.I.T. Launch.\nKoobatian said in an interview with The Phillipian, “We’ve kind of known that there had to be a hackathon at some point, just from the offset of the Makerspace, but it only started getting planned about five weeks ago. That’s a pretty short time. Most hackathons are planned months and months ahead… We organized the schedule, settled on a theme, we saw what other hackathons had done in the past.”\nLam said, “[Koobatian and I] have gone to a few hackathons ourselves, and we were always very intrigued by two things. First, the quality of work that came out of the hackathons. It’s just 24 hours… and yet, [competitors] come out with really nice web applications. The second part is really the sense of community. When you think about hacking, you picture this lone guy sitting in a room but that’s something we try to break away from.”\nAt the end of their 24 hours, groups presented their ideas and prototypes to a table of five judges, including two current faculty members, two alumni, and the co-founder of the Lowell Makes Makerspace. Projects were judged based on creativity, usefulness, how much was accomplished within the 24 hours, how many students the team recruited, as well as the presentations themselves.\nFay Rotenberg ’03, Venture Investor and Developer, and judge of Hack Andover, believes that holding hackathons at schools like Andover is important to inspire a love of building and ideation in students.\n“I think it’s really important [to hold events like Hack Andover], because in many cases, this is the medium of the world. This is how things are built, and I think encouraging people to come together and see what they can do and build within a really short period of time, that’s how you encourage founders and entrepreneurs to create things,” said Rotenberg.\nProjects included a redesigned Bluecard system, a campuswide scooter GPS system, and a charger organization system for silent study. Amanda Li ’18 and her group coded a website that would help organize the club system on campus.\nLi said, “We have so many clubs on campus, and it’s really awesome, but it’s disorganized. [My group] created a web app that basically catalogues all of the clubs and different club owners can add their club onto it. This means that anyone who registers with their Andover email can join clubs and get automatic updates, notifications, stuff like that… At the moment it’s beta, but we’re definitely thinking of taking this to a larger scale.”\nLi continued, “I think Hack Andover gives students a platform to really explore their problem solving skills, and to actually try and help students around them solve issues related to the Andover experience.”\nThroughout the day, workshops were hosted by student presenters. Ally Klionsky ’17 held a workshop on graphic design, Lam held a workshop on ideation, and Phillip Lamkin ’17 held a workshop on the coding language “Ruby.” The event was opened with speeches from both “Hacker-in-Chief” Head of School John Palfrey and Program Manager at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and the Founder & Executive director of MIT Launch Laurie Stach.\nKoobatian said, “[Palfrey] was talking about how when he first came to Andover he taught a course on hacking, and to him, hacking is about taking something that we deal with every day and deconstructing it, breaking it down to its most fundamental level, and then putting it back together again. I thought it was really interesting.”\nLam hopes that Andover will continue to host hackathons in the future, and views this year’s Hack Andover as a learning experience.\n“This was really a beta test to see how [a hackathon at Andover] would run… The results were not bad. I think in the future, we would definitely strive to invite other schools as well, that’s something that seems feasible now with a little more planning. Also, we’re hoping to expand some of the tools that are available. Some people were stuck with using the vinyl cutter, for example, because we didn’t have enough resources there to help them. That’s something we could improve upon,” said Lam.\n“[Laurie Stach] told us three things, and I think the one that stuck with me the most was ‘scare yourself.’ Go outside of your comfort zone. We’ve all heard that before, but especially how it relates to a hackathon, that’s something that we’ve never done before, and it’s a great experience,” continued Lam.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nA proctor and prefect leadership opportunity for day students has been created to further integrate efforts between the day student and boarding student communities.

I’m hoping to… get their input [on this issue] also,” said Mundra.\nCreating day student leadership positions is  part of a movement for more inclusivity and integration between day students and boarding students.\n“Because of the fact that [day students] are not a part of the boarding experience, I think they feel like they’re missing out on a large portion of the Andover experience. We really want to make sure that they feel included right from the beginning, and make sure that they feel like they have a lot of opportunities to get involved in all aspects of campus life,” said Theodore Parker, Dean of Abbot Cluster, in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“The day students bring so much. It’s good to be able to tap into those interests and skills earlier to make sure that they are feeling that they are a part of the Andover community and are willing to step up and provide leadership opportunities for day students. The intention of the program is to decrease the amount of time it takes to feel a part of this community and then also to create bonds and relationships with boarding students,” Parker continued.\nThe Cluster Deans, Day Student Advisors, and the Dean of Students & Residential Life Office are behind the institution of this new system. They hope to create small groups that could meet during orientation.\n“We are trying to make groups of about eight new students and two prefects. We are thinking of ways in which those groups could meet during orientation, and those groups could meet informally during the school year, but then also have specific events for them,” Mundra said.\nThe new system would entail the support of the pre-existing support system for day students.\n“Obviously our proctors and prefects are supported very much by their house counselors, and these particular groups doesn’t have such particular assignments, so I think we have a number of Day Student Advisors who are eager to be connected and supportive, and so I think we’re going to be exploring and considering how best to match our leaders with faculty. We’re going to be leaning on this first group to work some of our logistics out,” said Elliott.\nThe new system is still being worked through by Cluster Deans in the hopes of creating convenient times to host day student gatherings.\n“We’re trying to work through structural ways that we could be supportive of the larger group, [or if] it makes sense for us to host day student gatherings… or times for them to get together and spaces for them to be together. Cluster Deans are trying to work through, too, times when they would host day student cohorts that way,” said Elliott of the ongoing effort.\n\n', 'Apr 8, 2016'), ('\nAs students gathered around the lobby of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), the ten newly selected Class of 2017 Blue Key Heads sprinted through the doors donning blue accessories and cheering “Let’s Get a Little Bit Rowdy.”\nBen Andresen ’17, Brandon Barros ’17, Laura Bilal ’17, Luke Bitler ’17, Nikki Dlesk ’17, Jackson Lee ’17, Evelyn Mesler ’17, Lydia Paris ’17, Auguste White ’17, and Eliot Zaeder ’17 were chosen to inherit the iconic navy blue skirts from the Class of 2016 Blue Key Heads.\n“It was electrifying! I was so pumped up on adrenaline and out of breath that I couldn’t make noise because I had my breath taken away,” said Lee.\nBlue Key Heads are spirit leaders and serve as role models for students at Andover. Blue Key Heads attend Andover athletic events and wear their blue skirts every Friday. With 30 candidates this year, the competition to be selected was higher than that of recent years.\n“It was very difficult for us because there were so many wonderful, deserving candidates,” said former Blue Key Head Kelly McCarthy ’16.\nEach Blue Key Head applicant was required to hand in an application and perform an audition in front of a crowd of people. These auditions included performing a song of the applicant’s choice, as well as doing push-ups in front of students in Lower Right of Paresky Commons.\n“I had to recite poetry with the song ‘Work’ by Rihanna, and did it with a straight face. I didn’t really listen to the song before, so I mispronounced some things and people thought it was funny,” said Bitler.\nMesler said, “I put myself up a lot, and I worked on getting the crowd going, and making other people laugh. It’s a great experience whether you get the [Blue Key Head] title or not.”\nAs a unit, the Blue Key Heads of 2017 hope to elevate the school spirit by leading events such as New Student Orientation Day, Pep Rallies, and of course, Andover/Exeter Day. “Blue Key Heads are people who many look up to and are inspired by. If I can do my job right, it means someone out there is looking out to me and is inspired by what I do,” said Lee.\n“We’re going to try to help everyone, and build off of what the Blue Key Heads before us have given us with new ideas… I want to make sure that everyone in this campus feels engaged within this awesome community that we have,” said Bitler.\nIn Spring Term, the former Blue Key Heads of 2016 and current Blue Key Heads of 2017 will participate in various bonding exercises. Together, the new Blue Key Heads will follow their former Blue Key Heads’ footsteps to be the spirit of the school next year.\n“I am so proud of them and so ready for them to own it.

I want to wake people up to the things we are doing to our planet and provide them with reasons that can give them help, like actions that they can personally take, and to grow our youth program, Roots and Shoots.\nHow can we students be environmentalists, or take action? All the [students who want to become environmental activists themselves] will want to find out about our Roots and Shoots program, and join it. That is a program of encouraging young people to do projects. Actual projects – hands on, rolled up sleeves, to make the world a better place. Projects to help people, projects to help other animals, and projects to help the environment that we all share. This program’s now in 140 countries, and we’ve got about 100,000 active groups. The most important message is that every single one of us makes a difference every single day, and we have a choice as to what kind of difference we will make.\nHow can we harness social media to advance environmental protection causes? I think it’s vital that one does more than just be connected through this technology. It’s important, and there’s a way to use it for good, like with social media bringing people together around an issue. For example, last year, when I was at the Climate March in New York in September, the organizers expected maybe 80,000 people. In fact, there were 400,000. I was there, and I know that everybody there was on their little gadgets. They were calling up their friends, or they were tweeting, twittering, whatever it is that you all do. I saw there were people coming in response… This was the biggest gathering of people in the history of the planet around a single issue. It’s very important to have face-to-face as well, and it’s really important to make time to be out in nature so you actually get the feeling for what it is you maybe want to help protect, especially for children.\nWhat’s your favorite social media outlet? I have one blog that I [update] every two weeks called “Jane Goodall’s Good for All News Stories of Hope.”\nHow did you find the courage to bring the situation in the Gombe Stream National Park into light? How did you find the courage to be the face of the cause? It didn’t take courage at all! It was what I had always wanted to do, for me there was no courage involved. What the fight was was everybody laughed at me and said it was ridiculous and I’d never manage it. Except my mother said I would have to work hard, take advantage of opportunity, and never give up. It’s what I say to all the students every time I speak.\nHow did you transition from working on one environmental issue, the deforestation of chimpanzees in Tanzania, to gradually, a lot of issues – a lot of diverse issues? Just [by] taking things as they came and becoming involved with this issue and that issue and moving up very gradually. There was no plan, there was no plan to do this. It just evolved like a tree growing.\nHow were you first inspired to start your practice? Researching and eventually, activism? I was born loving animals, and I decided to go to Africa when I was ten. I eventually got there and Louis Leakey, [a Kenyan paleoanthropologist and archaeologist], offered me chimps above all else, and I became passionate and wanted to learn more and more and more. Why did I leave the beautiful forest? It was because I realized chimp numbers were decreasing, forests were being cut down, treatment and captivity, and things like that. It was time I did something for the chimps.\nWhat do you think are the personal traits that have helped you establish your career? One, I think, was where I was brought up, with my supportive mother. Two, I was given two gifts – just given them – one was a very strong constitution to help the world, to travel, all over, and remain healthy. The other was a gift for communication.\nHow did your ideas of nature and wildlife change after your many years of research? The only thing that changed was that I realized there was no way of protecting chimps and forests unless the local people’s lives could be improved, the people that live in such poverty that having cut down all their own trees, there was no way we could keep them from cutting protected trees. So that’s how our big program, which we call Take Care, or TACARE, that’s how that began. It’s very, very successful. Now the local people are helping us protect the forests.\nHow can students experience something similar to what you felt during your research that connects them more with nature and wildlife? You can volunteer. If you look it up on the Internet, there’s all sorts of programs. If they need money then they’ll have to make it. So many students expect everything to be given to them on a plate, and you can’t do anything unless you get a grant. Take a look at the stuff that’s out there which talks about the state of the planet, or get involved with the Jane Goodall Institute or some other similar organization. As I say, most people believe that whatever they can do will be inconsequential, and they won’t bother to do anything.\nWhat project(s) are you working on now? I personally am not working on a project. There is really nothing now. It’s all interconnected, but I suppose one of my main goals is growing these programs around the world, because if we have a critical mass of young people out there being educated through a program like Roots and Shoots.\nCould you give us a preview as to what you’ll be speaking about next week at Andover? I’ll be speaking about my upbringing, my research attempts, why I left the forest, and why we need to get involved now before it’s too late.\nGoodall will be presenting on Friday, April 8 at 7 p.m. in the Cochran Chapel.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Apr 1, 2016'), ('\nInspired by the technology offered by the Nest, Buzzy Barrows ’18 and Alex Reichenbach ’18 are in the midst of constructing a fully-functioning drone. Barrows and Reichenbach will create the drone from scratch using equipments from the Elson Art Center and the Nest. With prior experience in building drones, the pair plans to complete the drone by the end of the term.\nReichenbach said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I have always been [interested in technology.] My parents stuck me in front of a computer instead of a TV.” Barrows said in a phone interview with The Phillipian, “We were in the [Nest], and Alex and I were looking at all this equipment, and pretty much none of it was really being used so we decided to see if we could do something, because there are all these resources we now have, and so we decided what we’re interested in, we thought about it, and really the most practical thing, what made the most sense was to do something similar to a remote control airplane, or helicopter.”\nThe pair began their design process at the start of winter term and commenced the building process last week.\nLater on in their building process, Barrows and Reichenbach plan to use a Dremel – a rotary tool – as well as drills and 3D printers to construct smaller parts of the drone. The larger components will be built with access to more complex tools such as a spot welder in Elson. The drone design includes a foam exterior with plastic and metal components inside. The duo wants to keep its design as light as possible with a 14-inch frame.\n“The first time [the drone] flies, it will be controlled by a human, but we hope to have it flying by itself so that it will be an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV),” said Reichenbach. Reichenbach and Barrows do not intend to use their completed drone regularly at school. According to the Blue Book, “Drones may not be used by students without explicit permission from a cluster dean.” However, the pair is still planning their first test flight to be on school grounds after receiving permission.\n“I wouldn’t see any uses of this drone in particular on the Andover campus itself. But, definitely, I can think of pretty much endless uses for something that maps an interior space. For example, I’ve heard of Archeological trips that Dr. Slater was doing. He’s my advisor last year. I could see this thing being used in caves and spaces… to try to help map and keep people safe. You could see it being used in a lot of different places. Not specifically on Andover campus, but definitely in the spaces where Andover students go and stuff like that,” said Barrows.\nThe duo is unsure of what the completion of the drone will bring, other than personal reward. Reichenbach is unsure of projects or plans he would like to pursue in the future. “You could have a project making smaller versions of it and practice with a swarm. [A swarm] is a type of flying for drones, where you have a whole bunch of tiny ones working for a larger goal. And that would be fun. But other than that, I don’t really have any other plans,” said Reichenbach.\nThe project is funded by the Nest. Currently, the Nest has funded $60 to $80 towards their project, with the overall cost predicted to be $120.\n\n', 'Mar 25, 2016'), ('\nOut of the Blue Mae Zhao\nWithin minutes, a public congratulatory post on social media escalated with tension as insensitive comments on wealth and privilege were exchanged amongst users, leading to heated quarrels.\nAndover’s social justice group, Out of the Blue (OOTB) caught this misuse of social media and responded by holding an open forum on Friday, December 11 to discuss the appropriate usage of social media in conducting discussions.\n“We thought it was pretty important for everyone to come together in person to discuss how we should conduct ourselves online [and] whether social media was the right platform for people to discuss these issues,” said Avery Jonas ’16, a board member of OOTB.\nDuring the forum, Head of School John Palfrey, students and faculty explored different issues on social media usage, including how our rights for freedom of speech can be appropriately applied on social media.\n“Mr. Palfrey [concluded the event by summing] up what a lot of us were thinking, basically saying that social media isn’t the right place to have [some of] these conversations, and if you decide to talk about topics of identity, [there are occasional] limitations to free speech,” said Jonas.\nFor Jonas, the forum was not only a way to discuss how students should conduct themselves on social media, but also a way to get students unfamiliar with social justice issues to join the conversation.\n“I think [the forums are] a way to get people who… don’t usually engage in discussing topics of identity to come out and see that it is not just a bunch of people out to get them… We can all learn from each other,” said Jonas.\nMembers of the group hope to break the stigma around political correctness and strong liberal political views. “I feel like the problem in our forums in the past is that we only get one voice. We are only getting the liberal-minded people who generally agree with what the Out of the Blue board would agree with. I feel like we are not getting the discourse there… when, in reality, we are trying to create this discourse. I feel like it can be polarizing at times,” said Bennett Sherr ’17, a board member of OOTB.\n“[Many students] feel like they want to learn more but they feel as though their biases or beliefs keep them from being able to come to these spaces…because they believe that the majority of people at the forums have this opinion and their opinions may not agree with that,” said Jonas.\nClaudia Meng ’18, a board member of OOTB, believed that the stigma against voicing unpopular opinions could cause their forums to be often misunderstood. “[The forums] are supposed to raise relevant questions about race, class ability, gender; all aspects of identity, and [OOTB’s social media usage forum] in particular raises questions about… how can we be respectful of each other while maintaining our own personal right to express ourselves,” said Meng.\nOOTB hopes to continue holding forums addressing social justice issues relevant to the Andover community, and to encourage on-campus discussion.\nMore than Just a Number Cecelia Vieira\nEarly 2014 was a turning point for conversation regarding race at Andover. Students banded together to write a series of Commentary articles about their experiences regarding their race, and a group of then-Uppers and Seniors especially felt inspired to take the dialogue further.\nThe “I, Too, Am Andover” campaign began when a group of students, calling themselves “More Than Just A Number,” released their mission statement and began advocating for the importance of discussion about race on campus.\nA main focus of the group was to raise awareness of harmful microaggressions towards students of color.\n“I was approached by [Jaleel Williams ‘15] and [Alex Thomas ‘15]… The two of them approached me and asked about being an advisor for the group, and I wasn’t quite sure, at first, how they were seeing the formation of this group… Part of [me questioned] how this group [was] going to be any different than the other groups that we have on campus,” said LaShawn Springer, Director of Community & Multicultural Development.\nThe “More Than Just A Number” movement decided to bring the conversation online, and the “I, Too, Am, Andover” group began a photo campaign, emulating the efforts of the “I, Too, Am Harvard” movement founded by black students at Harvard College in 2014.\nThe photo campaign featured portraits of black students holding boards with microaggressions and racist comments they have heard on campus. Though the photos were originally shared on the group’s Tumblr and Instagram accounts, the movement began to spread onto other social media sites as well, with students changing their profile pictures to these photos.\n“It was really widespread on social media… I think that it was helpful for students to see other students who they knew and were friends with say these things through this medium that they might not have said otherwise. [The movement] gave them the confidence to do that,” said committee member Julia Zell ’15. Committee member Alba Disla ’15 believed that taking the movement to social media helped broadcast the group’s message to a wider audience.\n“Using social media helped get our message out to a broad audience in a visual way. We were putting faces to the stories that we often heard about by ear or in other Phillipian articles. We got support from a lot students in helping form the committees and carry out the photo project,” said Disla in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe group’s work to expose the power of microaggressions in everyday interactions using social media helped to further open the conversation about race on campus. James Taylor ’16, who was a Lower when the movement first began to gain traction, appreciated that the group took the lead in confronting the unease black students at Andover experienced. “I think it was important that the ‘I, Too, Am Andover’ campaign came to Andover because it really gave voice to a lot of the issues that students of color, specifically black students on campus, face that people [didn’t] necessarily [know] about… It was really just a good way to express openly some of the issues and discomfort that black students at Andover sometimes feel around being in this space,” said Taylor.\nFeminism = Equality Sarah Rigazio\nWith the aid of their Facebook page, over 1,000 members connected to Andover have carried on the social movement “Feminism Is Equality” since 2013.\nThe movement “Feminism Is Equality,” or most commonly referred to as F=E, was jumpstarted on campus by several members in the class of 2013. Sparked by the recent school president election in which the winners were the only pair with two males, and not the other pairs consisting of one male and one female, MJ Engel ’13, Maia Hirschler ‘13, Sam Green ‘13, Henry Kennelly ‘13, and Gabbi Fisher ‘13 wrote a Letter to the Editor in The Phillipian in the hopes of initiating dialogue.\n“[We] wrote a Letter to the Editor in The Phillipian about how voters should keep gender in mind when voting because at that point our school had only had four female school presidents in the 40 years of co-education,” said Engel in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe Facebook group “Feminism at Andover,” started by Engel and her peers in the class of 2013, is still an active group in which Andover students can post and discuss issues regarding feminism. The online tool provides constant thought-provoking debates regarding feminism both within and outside the Andover community.\n“Anyone affiliated with Andover from students to faculty could join [the Facebook group] in order to further discuss gender, race, class, and other intersectional issues. During my time on campus a lot of the debates were held in the Facebook group. These debates were about campus-related issues as well as more general discussions,” said Engel. Anyone in the group is encouraged to comment and share their opinion on whatever matter the post concerns.\n“I think this social media group allowed people who maybe didn’t want to speak in public forums [with] an opportunity to read, participate in discussions online, and become better informed about what the movement was trying to do,” continued Engel.\n“[In the Facebook group], people posted everything from observations to articles and sparked dialogue within the broader Andover community of faculty, students, and alums,” said Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English.\nThough Liz Irvin ’17 was not here for the start of the movement at Andover, she believed that the social media movement was the creator of the thriving feminism that exists here today.\nIrvin said in an interview with The Phillipian, “[F=E] laid the groundwork for the feminist community at Andover now. I know that it was centered around the idea of making feminism something that people could understand, by simplifying it in terms of equality. So, now there are ways that we can use that, use what they started.” An active participant of Women’s Forum (WoFo), Irvin attributed the current message and purpose of the club to the F=E movement.\nIrvin said, “[F=E] is important because it’s the backbone of any other kind of feminism-related movement. In WoFo, we’re trying to focus on being intersectional – so including systems of oppression and looking for equality in different ways. It all boils down to F=E, feminism equals equality; it means all kinds of equality, which is something that we’re constantly trying to focus on.”\n\n featured \n\n', 'Mar 25, 2016'), ('\nClicking through vibrant slides detailing their hard work over the past terms, students showcased their Independent Projects (IPs) to a colloquium of students and faculty members in the Nest last Wednesday.\nTerrence Xiao ’16 presented his integrated aquaponics project, Veronica Nutting ’16 and Alex Armour ’16 presented their research on contemporary depictions of Native Americans in 19th century artwork, and Yatharth Agarwal ’17, Tony Tan ’17, and Cam Wong ’16 spoke about the launch of their PA Capture the Flag (PACTF) competition.\nXiao developed an interest in aquaculture during middle school when he first started maintaining his own aquariums of fish and plants. After learning more about the science of aquaponics – a system that combines the practice of raising aquatic organisms as livestock and the cultivation of plants through the direct suspension of root systems in nutrient solution – Xiao applied for an Abbot grant and an IP to support his goal of building an aquaponics system on campus.\n“My original hope for aquaponics was actually that I would be able to build a really big system or greenhouse that Paresky Commons could use. As it turns out, that idea was a little too ambitious… In terms of the scope of the project itself, I really wanted people to start talking about environmental consciousness and activism on campus,” said Xiao in an interview with The Phillipian.\nXiao constructed the system in Gelb room 109 from a fishtank and grow beds, which allowed crops to take in nutrients from the water, and is currently using it to grow plants like arugula, cilantro, and spinach. He has documented the process in his blog at paaquaponics.worpress.com.\nXiao believes that aquaponics represent a new manner of food production that could have the potential to address issues related to the global food shortage.\n“My goal isn’t just to showcase this amazing new technology, or try to singlehandedly curb global hunger, but rather to demonstrate that these issues of sustainability and environmentalism and food production… can actually be explored by students in a very direct physical manner, in this case, by literally building an ecosystem and being able to interact with it,” said Xiao.\nAgarwal, Tan, and Wong also received an Abbot grant to fund their IP, and used their knowledge of coding and computer science to launch their own online CTF competition, in which participants solve increasingly challenging security puzzles.\nThis competition, called PACTF, will differ from typical CTF in that rounds of the tournament last for a two-day span rather than two weeks at a time, which allows Andover students to participate despite their busy schedules. PACTF has a total of $2000 in prizes to distribute to the team that gathers the most “flags” at the end of the match.\n“[Agarwal] and I were in the same dorm, and we were both into computer science, and we both knew how to program, but we had never heard of CTF before. We got an email from [Maria Litvin] and the Computer Science Club saying that there was a [CTF event] going on at Carnegie Mellon University. We did pretty well for the first time, and that got us interested, so we started participating in more CTFs,” said Tan in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“We’ve gone from not knowing what CTF stands for to having applied and gotten approved for an Abbot Grant, having applied for and completed an IP, to finally reaching the point where we’re launching an online CTF competition in a fortnight,” said Agarwal.\nPATCF is open to individual participants and teams all around the country, and clubs like Techmasters and Computer Science Club will be teaching more about CTF this spring.\nWong, in retrospect, encourages other students to apply for an IP.\n“The best thing to do is just go for it. I’ve gone for many, and I’ve gotten several rejected… That’s what the whole process is for: It’s to make you think about what exactly you’re doing, and whether or not you can actually get it done.

So far, the company has sold about four hundred shirts.\n“We created an Instagram to target the massive amount of high school students who are constantly checking their phones. As we continue to spread our company, we believe that the best way of spreading our message is by supporting our brand and what we stand for,” Tsai continued.\nOver Thanksgiving Break, Kim picked out the material in the street markets in Seoul, South Korea, and went to a factory to manufacture the shirts. “We think of ideas, brainstorm, draw out designs, and then start working with these companies.

Designing the sample tube, however, is no easy task according to Sherman, as the collected samples must be airtight, allowing little to no gas from the Mars’ atmosphere.\nAlongside a team of about 20 to 30 people, Sherman takes charge of fabricating a substance that will absorb all contamination and keep the interior of the sample tube airtight.\n“We are trying to coat the inside of this tube with a material that keeps contamination from sticking to it. It’s something that hasn’t really been done before, [as] we are basically trying to keep carbon from sticking to the tube, and that is unusual,” said Sherman in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\nThe sample tube will be hermetically sealed, meaning that there will be no exchange of gases from the exterior of the tube to its interior.\nSherman’s usual workday consists of solving any challenges that arise in the building of the sample tube while also further creating its interior coating.\n“About half of [my time] is filled with meetings, for a lot of the engineering we do involves interchange of technical information with other people… The other half of my time is spent doing analysis on stress,” said Sherman.\nSherman works with NASA at a Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the California Institute of Technology as a mechanical engineer.\nShe studied Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, where she graduated in 2008. After Princeton, she continued to find opportunities to pursue engineering.\n“From [graduating Princeton], I got some internships doing some spacecraft, or astronautical engineering, so designing big crafts for [California Institute of Technology], and that helped me get prepared for aerospace engineering,” said Sherman.\nSherman found her passion for mechanical engineering at Andover.\n“When I was a little kid, I used to enjoy playing with Legos, so I’ve definitely always enjoyed engineering things and building things. Through my time at Andover, I found that I enjoyed math and science quite a bit,” Sherman said.\nAt Andover, Sherman focused her academic studies in math and the sciences, taking challenging courses that focused on engineering. As a Senior, Sherman was the only female member of the engineering club at Andover. In addition, Sherman was a participant in Science Club for Girls, where she facilitated science experiments for middle school girls. She also rowed crew throughout all of her four years at Andover.\nSherman encourages current students to try new activities and take advantage of the opportunities presented while at Andover.\n“A lot of people probably didn’t realize it, but when you were in high school – and especially at a place like Andover – you have plenty of opportunities available to try completely different things without having any prior experience with them. It may feel intimidating to pick up any sport or pick up any new hobby or interest, but this is absolutely the time to do it because they make it so easy for you at Andover. My advice would be to be as active as you can in clubs and activities. Don’t be afraid to branch out a little bit. You never know what will it will drive you to,” said Sherman.\n\n', 'Mar 25, 2016'), ('\nPaul Murphy ’84, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics, & Computer Science and Head Coach of Girls Swimming, has won one of the five seats as a representative on the Andover Public School Committee after beginning his campaign in early January.\nThe position entails working alongside the four other committee members at meetings every other week in order to determine a budget and other policies for the school system. Murphy decided to run for the three-year term as a way to give back to his town.\n“This felt like a way to do something outside of [Andover] that would be helpful to the town… Everyone should have their little bit of extracurricular that they could do. I think it will balance well. I love being back in the classroom. The last seven years, I was the Dean of Students, so I was pretty involved, and I couldn’t have possibly done anything extra outside. It’s a little bit of an opportunity to do something extra,” said Murphy in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAs the only teacher on the committee, Murphy looks forward to learning more about the way the Andover Public School System is run, contributing to the conversation about how tax dollars are spent in the system.\n“I’ve learned a great deal about the people in town and the school system in general since starting to run… Right now there’s a lot of conversation about the priorities in town, because you have to have a conversation about priorities in order to have a conversation on how the tax dollars are spent. So I’m looking forward to that,” said Murphy. Murphy will continue to teach and coach at Andover, while volunteering on the committee in his spare time.\n“I decided a long time ago that I was going to lean into it and ask for people’s votes, so I had a lot of folks helping me, writing postcards, holding signs on Saturday mornings downtown… Because I grew up in Andover, my parents are both still here and my sister works nearby, so there’s a lot of good networking that happened.

They will also take a “community-based approach to health and wellness,” hoping to transform Wellness Week and construct a Peer Health Educator program to encourage students to help each other. In addition, they plan to better integrate all new students and day students into the Andover community through mentorship programs.\nIn the debate this past Wednesday during All-School Meeting, Annette Bell ’16 and Theo Perez ’16, the 2015-16 Student Body Co-Presidents, posed questions to the two candidate pairs regarding both pairs’ platforms and ideas. Pettaway and Paleologos conveyed their intentions to combat a culture of toxic competition surrounding academics and the college process, as well as nearly every other aspect of student life. Their plan was created with a special awareness of the stress and competition that exists at Andover, which Pettaway and Paleologos hope to eliminate by creating a strong support system for students.\nThe duo garners confidence from its qualifications and background in student leadership; Pettaway is a prefect in Isham as well as a board member of several clubs on campus, and Paleologos has three years of experience on Student Council.

The duo’s chemistry is palpable. Reminiscent of two lifelong friends, they finish each other’s sentences and are frank with each other, behaviors that often appeared during their All-School Meeting addresses. The pair believes that their differences balance out; Perez’s showmanship couples with Bell’s poise. They play off each other in speeches and conversation alike. As the pair approach their last term as Co-Presidents, they agreed to an interview with The Phillipian. In their dim and dingy Presidential Office – which is far from presidential in appearance – tucked away in an alcove in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, the pair discussed the work that has made them a part of Andover history.\nWhat role do the Co-Presidents play? TP: I think the role is really what you make of it. There isn’t a strong precedent for what you’re supposed to do. There’s no real rulebook or guide as to what you’re supposed to do so it’s really what you make of it. In terms of what we have that is structurally laid out for us, we go to the Dean’s Table, weekly or bi-weekly we meet with all the Cluster Presidents and all the deans, and we talk about whatever subject they choose. As for what we’ve done on our own, we try and think a lot about setting an example. We try and think a lot about what we can do in our daily lives to try and make this place more comfortable. What makes a good Co-President? What are the qualities of one? Who might be a good one? TP: I think Abraham Lincoln would be pretty good… AB: I feel like the people have to be different. Theo’s… an interesting guy. He’s funny, he keeps people laughing, he’s always willing and happy to talk to people and goes out of his way to talk to people.\nWhat about you? AB: Me? TP: She keeps me organized. AB: I email and text him a lot to remind him about things he has to do. But I guess I bring a different side in…\nTP: Obviously we’re very different people. I’m all over the place, but for you, someone who isn’t all over the place, there’s still a lot of things people look at and admire. There’s a lot of things I look at and admire, like how you conduct yourself in your everyday life. AB: Next question. I don’t like talking about myself.\nWhat makes you guys a good pair? AB: I think what makes us a good pair is that we’re willing to be honest to each other about opinions. Because if we’re not honest with each other then we won’t be able to get anything done. And so, sometimes we’re more blunt with what we say to each other than others. For example, the other day, Theo was not responding to my text messages, and I texted him 12 times and Facebook messaged him and I was like “Check your gosh darn text messages! I’m tired and grumpy – just answer the phone!” TP: I was asleep! My phone kept ringing and I was like, “I am not dealing with this.” AB: He eventually answered after he saw the grumpy message.\nIdeally, what would Co-Presidents do? What should Co-Presidents do? TP: The goals that we set for this year, which I think should really be the goal in general of student council, are fostering connectivity and inclusivity. That’s just thinking about how we can make the whole community involved and feel welcomed here. AB: Not everything we did was in our platform. I think it’s taking initiative and being able to get it done because if you just have a closed mind of “This is what I’m gonna do and I don’t care about any else’s opinions or thought,” I think that it’s not gonna be a great experience. For me, I think it’s just everyone sees you and being, not necessarily as an inspiration, but as being someone that people can go up to and talk to and go and be the person that will make the effort to talk to other people and make people feel welcome and comfortable. TP: Picking up from what Annette was saying there, it’s not a punk rocker type of job. You’re not gonna go up there and be like “Oh, I’m gonna go up to Ms. Elliott and complain about all these things and have [her] take it back.” That’s worthless. It’s about building relationships with the administrators so, that way, ideas do come around and if students aren’t so sure about them, you could talk to them and inspect opinions and take that into account. It can and does make a difference. What was your biggest achievement? AB: I think our speeches just worked out really well. I love when everyone starts laughing, it just makes me feel so good! I’m not making the joke, but it’s still funny. TP: Sometimes you make the joke. AB: Very rarely. I feel like a lot of the time, speeches can be really boring, and everyone’s like “Oh my gosh, I just want this ASM to end,” and being able to have that moment when everyone’s like “Oh this is actually really funny, we’re enjoying this,” it’s really nice to have. That’s one of my achievements. Our first debate, I was literally about to pee my pants, I was so scared. I was shaking the entire time. Going from that to actually being confident… I made a small joke in our last speech, and I felt so proud. I’m slowly building up confidence. That was my big achievement. TP: I’m proud that I got to sit on the Schedule and Calendar Committee, and that I got to say things that I think were listened to. It was nice to be able to be involved with that, to try to share what I heard there with other students and faculty that I spoke to. I’m proud that I got to be on that committee and got to really think about the various schedules. Some things are still in flux because of the way implementation is going to work, but I made some suggestions that may very well have affected how an average day in the life goes for an Andover student in a couple years.\nAB: Meaning: if they don’t like [the schedule], blame Theo. TP: Well, yeah. But I like the idea that I was able to have some sort of tangible legacy there.\nDo students have enough power? AB: I think the biggest thing that we have to focus on in terms of talking about student power on campus is the way we approach it. Theo was kind of talking about it earlier, but if we come from the standpoint of “you guys are the worst, we don’t like you, you’re making all these horrible decisions,” the administration is not going to listen to us as much. TP: Somewhere where students undoubtedly have a major role is culture. That’s what I’ve realized, looking at things through my lens as Co-President, is thinking about things not just as institutional but as cultural. When I think about the things that I like the most about what goes on in our community and the things that I like the least, I can see all of them mirrored in our Senior class. Enough power, not enough power… it’s all sort of a subjective term. I think what it really comes down to is that we have a lot of control over the culture here, and while I acknowledge that we don’t have a lot of control in a vacuum, I think there’s a lot we can do in that regard. I think that, when we have a better culture established, we have a better chance of getting faculty and administrators to sincerely consider and appreciate what we’re saying.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nBig blue and white yard signs reading “Elect Paul Murphy for School Committee” line the Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science office walls on the second floor of Morse Hall in support of Murphy’s campaign for a seat on the Andover Public School Committee.\nPaul Murphy ’84, Instructor in Mathematics and Head Coach of Girls Swimming, is currently running for a seat amongst a committee of five representatives on the Andover Public School Committee, only a year after serving as Andover’s Dean of Students. There are two positions open and four candidates in the race.\n“There are a couple of reasons why I am running, mostly being heart and head. For my heart, I was educated in the public school system in Andover in the 70s and early 80s… so I have a nice tie to the public school system. I had a good experience when I was there,” said Murphy.\nMurphy continued, “From the head perspective, I think working here the last 27, almost 28 years taking what I’ve learned about education and administration to a committee that works with the superintendent about all kinds of things for the 6,000 kids that are in the school system, seems like a good use of my experience here.”\nThe position entails collaborating with other committee members to make decisions regarding Andover’s public school system. These decisions include educational goals and policies for the school district.\nIf elected, Murphy will serve on the Andover Public School Committee while still serving as an In-structor in Mathematics at Andover.\n“[The position is] a three-year term. Meetings are roughly every two weeks. There’s a lot of work that goes on, but my sense is that I’ve left my job of Dean of Students, and teaching now, it feels like I have the time and brain space to do this,” said Murphy.\nMurphy hopes to shed a new light on the discussions, provide a teacher’s perspective and represent Andover at the meetings.\n“Right now, there are no teachers [on the committee]… to have a teacher sitting there seems like a good idea, and [one that is] a representative from [Andover],” said Murphy.\nChristopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, is assisting Murphy with his campaign by finding people to distribute and hang campaign posters. Capano also helps to organize people to hold campaign posters in the downtown Andover area on Saturday mornings.\nCapano believes Murphy’s calm demeanor would be very beneficial to the committee.\n“I have worked with [Murphy] for a decade and he’s just one of the most conscientious and hard-working people I’ve ever been around,” Capano said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“He is very patient and very calm. In Andover, sometimes the school committee and the teachers unions argue a little bit, and I think they need people that aren’t going to get riled up, that are going to stay calm, listen to everyone, and help make a decision in a calm manner,” Capano continued.\nMurphy’s campaign began in early January, when he had to collect 50 signatures from Andover residents in order to reach the next round of the campaign process.

This operetta inspired Ames Sheldon, his niece, to publish “Eleanor’s Wars,” a novel written by Sheldon that describes American life during World War II through the lens of a tough mother, Eleanor, and her adolescent son, Nat, who is undergoing the rigors of life at Andover.\nSheldon wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “After September 11 when commercial air traffic was halted, as I listened to military planes flying overhead at night, I felt scared, wondering about what was going on – would we be attacked again? – and that got me thinking what it must have been like on the home front during WWII. At that point I realized I had a bigger story to tell – about war – in addition to the story about Nat.”\n“Eleanor’s War” revolves around Nat and his mother, Eleanor, an ambulance driver during World War I who marries a French surgeon she encountered while on the front. After her husband dies in the war, Eleanor returns home to the U.S. and remarries to an Andover alumnus from the class of 1915. They have children and their sons attend Andover during the 1940s. Eleanor shields her children from her involvement in World War I and the surgeon. Over the course of the novel, all of Eleanor’s secrets are unraveled, disrupting the family dynamic.\n“Ultimately ‘Eleanor’s Wars’ is about the horrors of war, the impact of war on those who serve and also on their families,” said Sheldon.\nIn her novel, Sheldon also touches on issues lurking under cover of daily life in the 1940s, including bullying in school, homophobia and sexism.\n“Bullying, homophobia and sexism are topics that interest me. In the past, it seems to me, people assumed that [these topics] were simply the way things were and therefore [the topics] were pretty well accepted,” said Sheldon.\n“I don’t believe [Andover] was any better or worse than other boarding schools during the 1940s. I think it was probably typical of many boarding schools at that time,” she continued.\nIn order to portray an accurate representation of life at Andover during World War II, Sheldon consulted her uncles, Ben Stevens and Pete Stevens ’44, and other alums from the period.\n“I asked a number of Andover alums from the 1940s and 1950s about any hazing that occurred at Andover during their day and all of them said there was nothing significant. However, my uncle Pete told me about a pretty awful hazing incident that actually happened to him, and I put that in my novel,” said Sheldon.\nAlthough Sheldon grew up around Andover alumni and had an understanding of what life is like at boarding school before she began writing the novel, she had to do extensive research to fully and factually represent life at Andover.\n“I started doing research for this novel 15 years ago. I visited campus a few times and met with Ruth Quattlebaum in the Andover archives and I spent a couple of days in the archives reading material from the 1940s and making copies of stuff to take home with me,” said Sheldon. “A classmate of my uncle Ben loaned me his yearbook, which was full of useful information about life on campus during the period. My other uncle, Pete, is still living and I picked his brain many times, asking questions.”\nSheldon then transferred her knowledge of Andover to her novel, allowing her to characterize Nat, who struggles to pursue his dreams away from home during a time of chaos and fear.\nSheldon said, “Nat doesn’t want to go to Andover but his father decided he will attend the school. He is overwhelmed at first and he hates it his first year but eventually Nat finds his way at Andover; he comes to feel like he’s a part of the community, he has a role to play. The school is very intellectually challenging for him at first but since he’s very bright the challenges stretch him and he appreciates that. In other words, Andover is quite a positive experience for him by the time the novel ends.”\nWhen asked about her own thoughts on the private boarding school experience, Sheldon wrote, “I think very highly of [Andover]. The private boarding school experience at [Andover] was ultimately quite positive for my character Nat, for both of my uncles, for my grandfather. My brother went to Andover for a year but it wasn’t a good fit for him. I never went to boarding school myself, but I went to a private girls day school which was very academically challenging and I loved it.”\nSheldon hopes to represent the perspectives that get lost in history and, in this case, she hoped to document the perspective of people at home during the war.\n“War is hell; the impact of participating in war continues throughout the life of those involved directly in the war and the experience of war impacts their families into the next generation and beyond. Also, secrets inevitably – eventually – come out. Honesty with disclosure up front is much wiser and healthier for everyone,” she said.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nIn collaboration with volunteer-based program e-NABLE, Eliza Bienstock ’18 and Abigail Enes ’18 created a prosthetic hand using the 3-D printer in The Nest, Andover’s Makerspace, located in the basement of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL).\nSince January, Bienstock and Enes have worked to print a prototype hand to send to e-NABLE, a network of volunteers from around the world who use 3-D printing to create prosthetic hands for those in need of an upper limb assistive device.\nBefore arriving at Andover as a new Lower this past fall, Bienstock read an article in “The New York Times” about the creation of cheap, 3-D-printed prosthetic hands, sparking her interest in the program.\n“I came to Andover and saw that in The [Nest] you could use the 3-D printers whenever you want without asking anyone. So then I realized that Andover would be a really good ally with… e-NABLE,” said Bienstock.\nBienstock and Enes initially struggled to print and assemble each part of the hand. Through a process of trial and error, the pair managed to overcome the difficulties and were able to create the hand within a week. Their faculty advisor, Claudia Wessner, Makerspace Coordinator, oversaw the process and helped them obtain the materials needed to complete the project, like screws and elastic.\n“[Bienstock and Enes] were both so excited and passionate about the project and truly embodied the design thinking mindset that we like to encourage in The [Nest]… They have done such a great job with it and have come up with so many innovative ideas to improve the design as well,” wrote Wessner in an email to The Phillipian.\nHoping to promote the usage of the 3-D printing resources available on campus, Bienstock and Enes plan to launch a 3-D printing club that focuses on community service in the spring.\n“We just kind of wanted to do something and make a difference in the community, and I wanted to be involved in community service, but I didn’t love everything that was on the list. I wanted to do something that I felt would have an impact on other people, and I thought this was a good idea,” said Enes.\nBienstock said, “It’s going to be community service-based and I guess it will also be good for people who are interested in the printing, but the idea is hopefully we’ll be able to meet some of the kids that accept the hands, and e-NABLE would help us do that, too.”\ne-NABLE connected Bienstock and Enes with the software to 3-D print the prosthetic hand and will also eventually connect the pair with the individual in need of the hand. Bienstock and Enes plan to ship the hand to their assigned recipient at some point in the coming weeks.\n“After e-NABLE checks over our prototype, they will assign us to either a family in need or a prosthetics store in a third-world country. The stores operate similarly to shoe stores, where a person can come in and try on the prosthetics to find one that fits and functions best for them. Then, they can buy it on the spot,” wrote Bienstock in an email to The Phillipian.\nWhile the cost of prosthetic hands can be upward to $100,000, e-NABLE reports that the cost of 3-D printing a hand is less than $30.\n“We’re also interested in trying to pair with a hospital so that people in accidents can take home a prosthetic immediately. While our hands would probably be a temporary solution, getting more advanced prosthetics can take months and are extremely expensive. Our 3-D hands would be immediate and free,” said Bienstock.\n“[e-NABLE is] also kind of guiding us in terms of in what direction we could take this project within [Andover],” she continued.\nEnes said, “[e-NABLE is] trying to help us expand the project [and] maybe do something they haven’t been able to do yet with 3-D printers and third-world countries.

The field of candidates in the race for the co-presidency was winnowed down to the final two pairs, Arthur Paleologos ’17 & Madison Pettaway ’17 and Rosie Poku ’17 & Johnny Rex ’17. Speaking about their platforms, the 4×5 schedule and the upcoming Empathy and Balance curriculum, the two pairs sat down with The Phillipian and shared their thoughts.\nCheck out http://elections.phillipian.net/ for exclusive content.\nWhy do you two want to be Co-Presidents?\nAP: We’re entering a very pivotal time in Andover’s [history], not just because of the new schedule change to the 4×5, but we’re also going to have a new massive athletic complex and the [implementation] of our first Empathy and Balance curriculum. There’s a lot of instances over the next year where students are going to need somebody on their side advocating for them and, especially, listening to them. You know, in the Student Council meetings sometimes, I’ve been asked why I don’t speak up more – I’m not always the first one to talk. I think part of being a leader is being a listener and taking input, processing that input and putting together comprehensive solutions that address the needs of everyone.\nMP: I completely agree with Arty. Andover has given me so much. Through its leaders, through what it has to offer: materialistic and just lessons. I just see being Co-President as another way to pay back Andover. Even though, yes you could do that through other roles, I see this as a different role where you’re actually working with the students and as Arty said, advocating for the students directly.\nWhat do you think makes an ideal Co-President?\nMP: So I think that an ideal Co-President is someone who knows how to listen and knows how to hear everyone else’s feedback in a constructive lens, instead of thinking that they are the main go-to power. It is also someone who is willing enough for change. You have to be on top of your feet, you have to know how to deal with stress and make that stress into something productive, something that could be used for the student body… I think you really have to be a main anchor for some people and to keep others afloat. By doing that, you’re really supporting other people.\nWhat makes you two a good pair?\nAP: I think when the whole election process starts up and people look for their partners, the first thing they’re always thinking of is electability. That comes from making sure your two partners draw unlike groups of people. I think not only Madison and I made ourselves an electable pair in that sense, but I think in getting just a bunch of different perspectives. We’re two people who are involved in very different things, maybe hold different views on some issues, but after talking to Madison for long periods of time, I think we both have the same set of values and a deep care for Andover.\nWhat would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?\nAP: For me, I would have to say mentorship and integration. It’s something that I saw lacking on the other platforms, and I wouldn’t attribute it to that they didn’t think of it or whatever. It’s just for us, we made mentorship and integration a huge priority. We don’t believe day students are receiving the same amount of mentoring the boarding students are, between trusted adults you just meet from being on campus, house counselors and sometimes advisors on top of that.\nMP: So I think that the health and wellness component of our platform is the most important just because my personal connection to health and wellness as someone who has dealt with mental health issues in the past. It’s also because, throughout my three years at Andover, I’ve seen other Co-Presidents mention health and wellness, but I feel as though it’s always sort of like “we’ll mention it, we’ll take a little step towards it, but it’s not that sort of leap that the school needs.” So with our platform right now, it has a lot of student-driven reforms within the health and wellness curriculum, including a public health educator which will be a peer student working with their other peers and even student-driven orientations for the [Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center.] I just think that right now, our health and wellness curriculum is being built on for future years, but for next year we’re in this year of transition and right now it’s sort of not there.\nIn what ways have you two done your campaigning for the Co-Presidency campaign?\nMP: We have a Facebook page, and we talked to our friends a lot about our campaign. During the signature process, a good strength of ours was that we, before we even collected signatures, sat down with each other and said, “What do we want to talk about before we go get these signatures?” [We asked each other], “Are there three things that we want to mention, and like just brief things about our platform?”\nDo you guys have a campaign slogan?\nAP: I mean both of our last names start with ‘P,’ so we could do “Paleologos and Pettaway for P.A.”\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nAnd then there were two.

It has really done so much to shape how I view the world and live my life and interact with others. I’m so grateful and appreciative of Andover and I want to give back to this community that I feel has given me so much and helped me to shape my identity. I want to be able to give back [to Andover] and I want to do it with Johnny too because he’s amazing and we work well together.\nJohnny: My answer goes hand in hand with Rosie’s, I just couldn’t imagine my life without Andover… I think going to Andover has really shaped me as a person and changed my viewpoints and helped me to be aware of my surroundings and understand others around me. For that reason, I’m really grateful for Andover. Same as Rosie, I really want to give back and be a leader for my school. I’m really psyched to run with Rosie, she’s super cool.\nWhat do you think makes an ideal Co-President?\nJohnny: I think somebody who doesn’t [put] themselves above others. I think a good Co- President should be really approachable and relatable, and I feel like Rosie and I have those qualities. We’re both very down-to-earth and we would be willing to talk with anybody who wanted to talk to us. I think Co-Presidents should definitely be approachable.\nRosie: Yeah definitely…I think they should be able to work together, but [also] bring different perspectives to things, which I think Johnny and I are able to do because we’re very different people. We have different beliefs, different [view on] lots of things, but we do work well together. A major key.\nWhat do you think makes you two a good pair?\nJohnny: Initially, I wasn’t planning on running for Co-President, but a friend of mine asked me if I would run with Rosie and I couldn’t [turn] away that opportunity. I just thought we would work well together… We’re both very involved on campus and we’re both super committed to everything we do and we love this school.\nRosie: We work well together, we’re willing to talk with any and every member of this community, and I think we cover a lot of people, a lot of different beliefs, [and] a lot of different aspects of campus, so we can represent the student body more fully.\nWhat would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?\nRosie: Probably, student health and wellness.\nJohnny: Our campus lacks a sort of education about substance abuse, and I think there is a lot of stress and peer pressure on campus to [participate in] these things. I feel like people don’t have any notion on how it could affect them before they do it, and only realize after they get into the substances or drugs and alcohol that they realize that these can be harmful. So, um, I think the big focus of our platform is to provide, to enhance and encourage discussions about substance abuse.\nRosie: And also within the general realm of health is sexual health. We know that in two years, the 4x 5 schedule will be implemented and there will be a whole Wellness, Empathy, and Balance curriculum within that, but next year it’s still sort of a lack of that; it’s the same schedule that we have this year. So, we want to be sure in that transition year, there will still be opportunities to learn about general wellness and in particular, sexual education. What we wanted to do was to have someone from the Sykes center come to every dorm and every day student advising group and answer your anonymously written questions about sexual health because that’s not required right now, but it’s an option. We want to make sure that everyone has the same grounding, same foundation in that.\nAnd also, we want to make sure that Wellness Week isn’t just being lectured at, but they’re engaging presentations and you also have a chance to talk about them afterwards because you have to reflect in order for anything to be effective.\nDo you guys have a campaign slogan?\nRosie: Rojo… rhymes with mojo. “RoJo is PA’s mojo” (they just came up with this on the spot)\nIn what ways have you guys executed your campaigning for the Co-Presidency campaign?\nJohnny: First, we started collecting signatures, that was probably the most important.\nRosie: And we talked with everyone about our platform. We actually got extra signatures, so we could make sure we talked to as many people as we could about it.\nJohnny: We started devising a platform beforehand, so we talked about our ideas with people and we got good feedback for the most part. And then we created a Facebook page. We tried to get attention from [Facebook] about our campaign, to post updates and thank yous.\nRosie: We were in the debate last week. And just talking to people if they ask, sometimes just bringing it up ourselves and letting them know what we stand for and what our platform is.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nThe Snyder Athletic Center Design Team hosted an informal information session in the Mural Room of Paresky Commons on Tuesday, inviting students and faculty to take a look at potential graphic designs for the building and give feedback on the building’s image and branding.\nTyler Hinckley, a Project Architect at the Perkins+Will firm in Boston, said, “The primary goal of this gathering is to really get the community’s input on what message the building should convey and how to convey that message. So it’s certainly an update on the design progress, but we’re really looking for feedback on what this building is really about [and] how you convey that through traditional graphics or more contemporary graphics, bold interests of color or large text.”\nAfter a planning process that lasted for more than a year, the architectural design is now in the finalizing process. Andover’s Athletics Facilities Master Planning Committee worked with Perkins+Will to design the architectural structure of the building. The company’s subcontractor, omloop, provided expertise in branding and building the visual identity.\n\n“There are certain things you have to do in a building as far as graphics, like the way people find their way [around the building], but there’s also an opportunity to express the history of [Andover] and also kind of mix in the energy of the space,” said Brian Pearce, owner of omloop.\nThe building will feature a new indoor 200-meter track, 12 squash courts, locker facilities, weight rooms and multipurpose classrooms. The infield of the track will have four indoor tennis courts that can double as basketball courts. These extra facilities will allow more teams to practice at the same time, end sports earlier and allow outdoor sports teams to hold indoor practice sessions in bad weather.\n“One of the biggest benefits and one of the biggest goals of the design is that [sport] practices will be complete by dinnertime… Instead of having practices go past dinnertime [and] into study hours, practices will be completed by dinnertime so you can go to dinner and get your work done without having late practice,” said Hinckley.\n\nNancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School and Co-Coordinator of the Athletic Facilities Master Plan, said, “Some of the outdoor sports that suffer from not being able to compete during bad weather will have a place to come in bad weather and still practice and compete. These are modern facilities. We’ll be able to host more tournaments and provide more space for kids, recreationally and in terms of interscholastic sports.”\nThe construction of the Snyder Center will mark the first step in completing the strategic plan’s four-step institutional initiative to improve Andover’s athletic facilities.\n\nWilliam Orben, Instructor in Math, Statistics and Computer Science, said, “I play a decent amount of squash, so having the great opportunity to play squash in the courts will be awesome, and also, because I coach soccer, the possibility of our players having a locker room space closer to the field is a big deal.”\n“[I’m excited] to have a better indoor track, and a better facility where everything is [in one place], like squash, basketball and track, and you don’t have to go to different areas around campus to see different sporting events. It’s really convenient. This is very promising for our Senior year,” said Jeff Zaeder ’18.\nAlex Dziadosz ’16, Co-Captain of Andover Boys Soccer, is happy that future students will have the opportunity to experience the convenience of a new athletic center closer to the field.\n“For me, being a soccer player here at Andover, having the convenience of the new athletic center right next to the field would be great… Borden Gym has gotten a little outdated. They have done a great job keeping the integrity of the building and a lot of the buildings here at Andover, but I think the students – especially athletes – are looking for something new, something refreshing. This will be a really nice facility and that makes me really excited,” said Dziadosz.\nDziadosz also hopes that the facility might include more areas for teams to meet and discuss their sport. “[I’d like] more team meeting rooms. Not just rooms where you can sit as a team, but more interactive, with TVs or projectors to watch films… If we could get updated spaces where we can do more advanced kinds of chalk talks, scouting other teams and programs, I think that’d be super helpful… If we could have spaces right in the athletic center, just 20 yards from the field, where we could go to continue our session, that’s a game-changer,” said Dziadosz.\n“I’m excited for the new workout gym, which will give students an opportunity to become stronger and fit for different variety of sports. Being strong is an important aspect for all athletes in all sports and the workout gym will help with this,” said Jack Warden ’19, an attendee of the session.\n“[The Snyder Center] is a place where every single kid on this campus can come to have fun and be fit, and hang out with friends in a really healthy way. I just think it’s going to be a very cool place, very inviting, with lots of options for kids,” said Jeton.\n\n\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nAfter a three-month long nomination and proposal process, Auguste White ’17 was named next year’s recipient of the Lorant Fellowship. White will serve as an intern to a midwife in Tanzania for a month in June in the hopes of bringing awareness to the medical struggles that underprivileged women face during childbirth.\nThe Lorant Fellowship will endow White with up to $6,000 to cover any expenses relating to her stay in Tanzania.\n“When I really thought about why I wanted to be a part of maternal women’s health it’s because every single person in the entire world has to be born at one point or another. No one lives without encountering birth at some point. I was frustrated, and I am frustrated, that the maternal health systems across pretty much every nation continue to leave women vulnerable and struggling and suffering,” said White during an interview with The Phillipian.\nWhite’s project will focus on helping women in Tanzania undergo labor and, in the process, White will attempt to elevate women from states of vulnerability to comfort. White will be based in the semi-rural community of Moshi, located near Mount Kilimanjaro.\nWhite will work with the villagers to assist with literacy studies, observe medical procedures firsthand and study the intersection between poverty and health care through an internship program called Gap Medics.\n“Going to another community, another culture, another country and [engaging with] the most vulnerable will give me a little bit of perspective on how to actually talk to very privileged students about sex-ed,” said White.\nWhite hopes to use the knowledge she gains while working with a midwife to raise the importance of intersectional sexual education to the Andover community.\n“I want to get us to a point where the students are able to get informed and strong input on what [sexual education] should look like for students in our age and our demographics, especially in such a diverse place like Andover,” said White.\nIn Tanzania, only half of all births occur in medical facilities, leaving the other half without adequate access to necessary medical equipment, according to Unicef.\n“I chose Tanzania because I was looking at the UN Millennium Goals and Tanzania described achieving improved maternal health by 2015 as impossible, so I wanted to see what it looked like at the other side of that goal. Seeing what that failure has done to the landscape of the country and the politics,” said White.\nWhite felt motivated to shadow a midwife because she wanted to become a midwife or an actor herself after her favorite television show “Call the Midwife.”\n“I just Googled ‘midwife shadowing opportunities abroad’ and there were a couple that were for 18 and older so I wouldn’t be able to go to those, but then after continuing to search online, I found Gap Medics,” said White.\nWhite looks forward to helping to care for babies and also learning more about the country of Tanzania.\n“The thing I’m looking forward to the most is getting to play with a bunch of babies, I think it’s what I’m good at and it’s what I love to do. Also, I’ve never been to Tanzania before, so I’m excited to see what it’s going to look like, what it’s going to feel like, who the people are and what the history has done to the nation,” said White.\nThe Lorant Fellowship Council consists of Dale Hurley, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science; Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Engagement; Keith Robinson, Instructor in Biology and Chemistry; Emma Frey, Instructor in History and Social Science; and Kassie Archambault, Admissions Counselor. The Council selects one recipient of the Fellowship annually, and several Uppers were nominated by their peers in the Fall Term for demonstrating strong character and citizenship.\nIn early December, the three finalists, White, JayShawn Fuller ’17 and Rosie Poku ’17 were notified by the Lorant Fellowship Council. Then the finalists used the Winter Break to discover a project they wanted to pursue. Once they returned, each nominee proposed a project which was then voted on the committee members.\n“I spent the time with my mom and my sisters just looking over online at programs that I’d want to participate in… I had this little booklet with pictures and ideas and the descriptions of the programs that I wanted to go on,” said White.\n“[Auguste] was very organized. She did a great job of presenting a good idea and a lot of it comes down to not necessarily not how good the project was but the passion that they have for them. Ultimately, we’re looking for somebody that’s going to come back and do something with what they’ve done,” said Hurley in an interview with The Phillipian.\nOnce White returns to Andover in the Fall Term, she will give a presentation during All-School Meeting on her project. Hurley hopes the experience will give White the opportunity to experiment with potential future career paths in this area.\n“I hope that somewhere down the road she pursues it further. That’s ideally what we want to see… It may not be exactly what she’s doing but at least it gives her a chance to sort of play with the idea. I think it will be interesting. I think that the thing I like about it most is that [Lorant Fellowship winners] end up doing something more with what they’ve experienced. Some of them actually change their college majors just from their experience,” said Hurley.\nWhite expressed gratitude that the Lorant Fellowship will allow her to pursue her passions and create positive change in people’s lives.\n“The Lorant Fellowship means that I get the chance to do what I love doing every day, which is making people around me feel good… the mere idea that people are being affected by me in a positive way is so rewarding and it makes my heart glow,” continued White.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2016'), ('\nOn Monday, February 15 at 5:38 p.m., Head of School John Palfrey raised his legendary blue squash racquet above the crowd in Lower Right of Paresky Commons.\nThis year’s Head of School Day (HOSD) pushed Tuesday’s class schedule to Friday. All classes and sports were cancelled, with the exception of Andover Girls Junior Varsity Basketball.\nThis announcement came after a week of Instagram images depicting Palfrey’s squash racquet in the hands of different alumni. According to the Phillips Academy Instagram, Palfrey claimed to have been missing his racquet since January 22. There were nine alumni who posed with Palfrey’s famous racquet for the HOSD social media build-up (#HOSD2016), including Kevin Olusola ’06, a member of the a capella group Pentatonix, Matt Noyes ’96, meteorologist for NECN, and Lisa MacFarlane ’75, Head of School at Phillips Exeter Academy.\nPalfrey said, “Honestly I did not plan for [#HOSD2016] – it was the fact that a bunch of students clearly thought it was going to be sooner and I got a fair amount of grief for not holding it sooner, and then I felt that, because I was planning to do it a little bit later mostly because the weather had been good earlier, that it made sense to try to have some distraction mode using social media.”\nPalfrey collaborated with Jennifer Savino, Director of Alumni Engagement, Tracy Sweet, Director of Academy Communications, and Neil Evans, Digital Communications Lead, to contact alumni for #HOSD2016. Savino contacted the alumni two weeks ago.\n“It was actually really hard because we have 25,000 interesting alumni. We had to do some brainstorming, and the list was pretty short and random, but we [chose to contact alumni we] thought were, generally, people that would be recognizable to the current student body,” said Savino.\nPalfrey said, “[#HOSD2016] actually came together very, very quickly. We actually had two racquets going. One was the official one and one was the not quite official one, and we had them sent around the country. Our alumni were very pleased to be involved in this conversation with the students so it was not hard to do.”\nCadet Alexi Bell ’13 was also featured on the Phillips Academy Instagram with the magic racquet.\n“I thought [#HOSD2016] was so cool! I remember spending pretty much every February evening of my Senior year in Lower Right waiting for someone from the administration to come in and raise the stick. I was honored and so excited to be on to be a part of the other side of it this year,” Bell wrote in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe timing of the day has always been purposefully ambiguous and at the discretion of the Head of School. This year, the day fell during Penultimate Week.\n“It’s a very complex analysis as to where Head of School Day ought to fall but it is always calculated to try to give the maximum relief to students at key moments when it’s needed,” said Palfrey.\n“[I hope HOSD was] just simply a break, a chance to smile a little more and do something that [students and faculty] wanted to do and to have a breather from what definitely can be a grind in boarding school and February,” added Palfrey.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nWith the whirring and beeping of 3-D printers echoing in the background, an excited crowd of students gathered in the Nest to watch Brittany Amano ’16 and Darius Lam ’17 discuss their entrepreneurial projects. The pair, who spoke last Wednesday, are the first student presenters for NestEd.\nIn the first year of its existence, the Nest has held a number of lectures and presentations from notable alumni and innovative speakers. Last Wednesday’s programming was the first to feature current students as presenters. Mike Barker, the Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services, has long dreamt of this moment and hopes for student-led NestED presentations to become commonplace.\n“It’s always been an aspiration that anything… about the [Nest] is about student agency and about kids doing projects that they want to do. So we’ve had these speakers come in and it’s been wonderful, but I think it’s a great opportunity for students to profile the work that they do,” said Barker.\nThe future of NestED will likely see more open-ended forums meant for students to exchange and improve ideas concerning a broad range of issues.\n“I would hope that people would raise their hands and say, ‘Hey, Mr. Barker, I’ve been working on this engineering project,’ [or] ‘I’ve been working on this app and I would really love to show it to some students and get people around with some pizza and they can respond to that.’ And that’s actually how projects get better,” said Barker.\nAmano and Lam, as this week’s special guests, presented separately on projects they had undertaken, and the lessons they had learned from their experiences. Amano discussed her inspiration and motivation to start her non-profit organization The Future Isn’t Hungry, and Lam talked about StackLife, a web application that virtually assists students in the research process, and his journey toward becoming an avid coder.\nFor Amano, the dedication to service began early, after she realized that her passion was not for sports, but for service. At eight-years old, Amano started her first food drive after her grandmother was laid off from her job and became homeless.\n“I wanted to give back to all those homeless shelters and food banks that helped her get back on her feet,” said Amano.\nDuring her appearance, Amano began by dispelling the long held idea that someone is “too young to do something.” Repeating advice she had once received from an 11-year-old, Amano discussed four crucial steps in making a difference. One, see a need. Two, make a plan. Three, gather friends. Four, change the world.\nWhen she was a senior in high school, Amano decided she wanted to spend her Post-Graduate year at Andover after having spent several years continuing her education exclusively online.\n“Andover has helped shape my project because of [the school’s] whole Non Sibi philosophy, which is the reason I chose Andover – because everyone here is so well-informed about issues and I’ve been learning so much about different issues that are facing this globe that I hadn’t even heard about before coming,” said Amano.\nAs of December 31st, The Future Isn’t Hungry has organized drives in all 50 states and served nearly 914,000 people. This number well exceeded Amano’s original goal of 625,000. With the help of the Jefferson Awards Foundation, Amano hopes to continue her organization’s outreach and expansion.\n“I just hope to motivate more youths across the country to get involved in the feeding of the hungry and start to branch out into new communities,” said Amano.\nFollowing Amano’s presentation was Lam, who has been coding since the seventh grade. Lam emphasized the importance of finding a clear goal when starting to code.\nLam said, “Simply wanting to change the world is too broad a goal.”\nFor StackLife, Lam found inspiration in a problem he observed while at Andover.\n“StackLife was directly influenced by a paper that I had to write for History last year. And it was kind of difficult for me to find the resources that I needed. So I really wanted to have a good way to be able to find new resources within that field and that kind of spurred me on to creating StackLife,” said Lam.\nThe main focus of StackLife is to catalog the library and promote discovery of resources using visualization. Lam hopes to soon introduce study tools, like allowing users to create their own list of resources that they found were helpful and can then share with their peers.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nDuring the Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar presentation by Ashley Scott ’16, “This Little Light of Mine” rang through Kemper Auditorium as audience members sang along, swaying to the voices of Andover’s Gospel Choir last Friday evening.\nEntitled “Spirituals and the Inversion of the African-American Church,” Scott’s presentation explored the creation and function of spirituals and the influence of black gospel music on American popular culture in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nSponsored by the Office of Community and Multicultural Development, the CAMD Scholar program, established in 2006, allows selected students to pursue independent summer research projects related to diversity, multiculturalism, community or identity under the guidance of a faculty advisor.\nScott said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Growing up, I always went to church with my grandmother, my father’s mom, and she went to a Presbyterian church, which has a very strong musical tradition. So I grew up listening to [spirituals] and singing these songs in church. When I first applied to become a CAMD scholar, I really wanted to do something important to me.”\nScott’s presentation focused on how spirituals were used to uplift people, direct slaves in the Underground Railroad and communicate hidden messages between slaves. Four songs, “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” “Wade in the Water,” “We Shall Overcome” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” sung by a student gospel choir supplemented Scott’s presentation.\n“I knew a lot of these [spirituals] before… I grew up listening to them and singing them. The most interesting part [about the research process] to me was finally understanding what they meant to all of the people around me. Because we would be singing a song – ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ – and so I would see the older people in the room crying. And I was like, ‘This is a nice song, why are we crying?’ And eventually, I learned what they meant,” said Scott.\nReverend Anne Gardner, Director of Spiritual & Religious Life and Protestant Chaplain, served as the faculty advisor for Scott’s CAMD Scholar project. The two worked closely together throughout the process of writing the paper and creating the presentation.\nGardner said, “Ashley is an exuberant student, delighted to dig into doing research, particularly if it required a historical lens. As a person of faith, this topic was both a personal and scholarly pursuit. This was my first time acting as a CAMD Scholar advisor. I am thrilled to have been part of this project with Ashley.”\nArzu Singh ’16, an attendee of the talk, felt the gospel singing in Scott’s presentation fostered a sense of community within the audience.\n“There was definitely a community aspect she brought to [the presentation] by doing so. The whole audience started singing with her. There was definitely this feeling of camaraderie which I think embodies the concept she was talking about,” said Arzu.\nGoing into the presentation, Scott aimed to help audience members gain a new perspective on the topics of race and religion.\nScott said, “This [project] was something that I knew a lot about on the surface, but understood and learned so much when I went underneath the surface and past just what the songs meant on their face. I really hope that audience members got that and that I conveyed that well.”\n“I also hope that they leave with a smile on their face, or are thinking hard about something that I brought up in my presentation, whether it’s about religion or race or whatever it may be,” Scott said.\n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nHenry Wilmer Jr. ’63, former Dean of Students and Instructor in French, passed away on December 22, 2015 in Lincoln, Vt., following a two-year battle with cancer.\nKnown for his humor, Wilmer is remembered as a special man with a kind heart.\nFormer Dean of Students Paul Murphy ’83 wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Henry redefined the role of Dean of Students. In fact, he changed the title from Dean of Residence to Dean of Students and Residential Life.  He did so to more accurately reflect what he did – interact with students and their lives.”\n“I vividly remember receiving a small note from Henry when I was in my first year [living] in America House.  He wrote just to say that he thought I was doing a solid job. It made an impact,” Murphy continued.\nWilmer assumed the position of Cluster Dean of West Quad North from 1983 until 1988. He served as Dean of Students and Residential Life from 1990 to 1995.\n“Wilmer was a very special man who had a sharp wit, good sense of humor and a kind heart. I worked with him for a couple of years (in my first two years as Pine Knoll cluster, Henry served as my Faculty DC Rep),” wrote Aya Murata, Associate Director of College Counseling, in an email to The Phillipian.\nDuring his time at Andover, Wilmer was also co-head of the Andover Drug and Alcohol Awareness Committee (ADAAC). He was part of the committee responsible for bringing John Morello’s show, “Dirt,” to Andover for Wellness Week, formerly known as Freedom from Chemical Dependency Week.\nTom Seeley ’90 wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Henry had an incredibly big heart with a matching personality.  As a former student, his empathy for students manifested itself in an unmistakeable kindness, even when meeting out discipline, as he was required to do in his position as Cluster Dean.  I experienced this first-hand as I struggled to keep up academically and with personal issues in my first two years.”\nSeeley continued, “Henry was among a group of teachers who took me under their wing to be sure I had the help and support I needed.  Often he would take me out for ice cream on a Friday night or just let me hang out in his kitchen if I needed a little space away from the day-to-day pressures of being a student at Andover.”\nIn addition to his various roles on campus, Wilmer served as Director of the Language Learning Center as well.\n“What I remember most was how engaging he was, whether telling an intensely personal story or just sharing a light-hearted moment, he commanded the room without dominating it.  I always imagined his classes would have been amazing, though I never managed to have him as a teacher.  [I] also wondered whether his southern accent would come through to a native French speaker (he was a French teacher when I was there),” wrote Seeley.\nDerek Williams, former Instructor in History and Social Sciences and a close friend of Wilmer, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Henry was like a brother to me.  At Andover my wife, who adored him, claimed that I spent more time with him than with her.  He was a dear man – sensible, generous, funny, formidably durable, insanely hard-working, ridiculously modest.  I’m not sure he realized the powerful and affirmative force he exerted – on me and countless others, students and colleagues alike.”\nWilmer is survived by his wife, Susie, and his children, Amie Creagh ’91 and Bo Wilmer ’90.\nCreagh, presently Dean of Students at Deerfield Academy, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Aspiring to match my dad’s sense for compassion, humility and integrity has made me a better person.  He combined hard work with fun and love with wonderful silliness. Dad enjoyed prolonged stretches in the outdoors far more than I, but I think of him every time I see a diamond snow or colorful sunset.”\n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nThree student groups presented their experiences with archaeology both on and off campus at the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology’s event on Tuesday night, “First Forays into Archaeology.”\nOpening the event was Viraj Kumar ’17 discussing the creation of his non-profit organization, Youth for Restoration, which works to preserve and restore local history.\n“The mission of the organization is to engage local communities in identifying and restoring old historic sites by pursuing their nomination for the State and National Register of Historic Places,” Kumar said in an interview with The Phillipian.\nKumar discussed the foundation of Youth for Restoration and two different historical sites, the Apoquague Friends’ Burial Ground and an old Grist Mill in the Hudson Valley area of New York, which his organization helped to preserve and restore.\nKumar’s first project was a 200-year-old Quaker cemetery located near where he lives.\n“The Apoquague Friends’ Burial Ground had remained neglected for decades. With the support of a great team of volunteers, the local government and businesses we worked over several weekends to clean up the site, rebuild the stone wall, erect the fallen 122 remaining headstones and cut down and remove fallen trees,” said Kumar during his presentation.\nFollowing Kumar’s presentation, Jacob Boudreau ’16, Alana Gudinas ’16, Mia LaRocca ’16 and Sarah Schmaier ’16 reflected on using 3-D printing technology to recreate some of the Peabody’s artifacts and the implications of this technology for museums in the future.\nThey demonstrated the process of scanning and 3D printing artifacts from the Peabody’s collection, a task assigned by their work duty advisor and Collections Manager, Marla Taylor.\nBoudreau said, “The replication of the artifacts can be broken down into two things: scanning and printing. The first thing we had to do was scan the artifacts to build a 3D model on a computer program. To print, you select the object’s structure, whether hollow or not, on the computer screen and it prints from the bottom up. The larger the object, the longer the print.”\nThe ability to replicate historic artifacts in this way provides many new possibilities for people to experience archaeology.\n“Having a 3D print of an object allows you to physically examine by handling and observing in greater detail without the concern for deterioration and it allows us to preserve something that may not last forever,” Gudinas said during the presentation.\nSchmaier added, “This technology could expand the future of museums. Now, museums are limited by how much funds they have and how much space is available, but what if museums could download any artifact they wanted in their exhibition?”\nIn the third and final presentation, Veronica Nutting ’16 and Alex Armour ’16 analyzed three paintings collected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They investigated the origins and importance of the artwork while also questioning how the paintings compared to contemporary depictions of Native Americans. This research was part of their Independent Project titled “The White Man’s Indian,” a project investigating the importance and context of three paintings, created by white Americans, which depict Native American culture.\nArmour and Nutting focused on the work of three artists: Charles King, George Catlin and Edward S. Curtis, all of whom documented Native American culture in the 19th century.\nArmour said during his presentation,“Although [King, Catlin and Curtis] were trying to preserve Native American culture, they did not do a good job. King’s paintings show a traditional European portrait [but] I believe that was not his main goal. However, he did come through with a very biased product, which shows how much the time period influenced artists.”\nNutting said, “History is told by the people who hold the paintbrush. I think [Armour] and I really have taken this entire project as a wake-up call of why we don’t question how there is still a sports team called the ‘Redskins’ and why people wear Native American headdress. It is really the white man’s Indian.”\nThese three presentations aimed to demonstrate how easy it is to get involved with the archaeology department. All of the presenters first became interested in their respective topic when they were assigned to work duty at the Peabody.\n“What I most enjoy about archaeology is the way it takes your mind to a place you never expected. Archaeology requires researching ancient people with open minds and different perspectives, and I think that’s a valuable skill,” said Gudinas.\n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nAs the distinct drum beat in the contemporary African music accelerated and intensified, Tricia Taitt ’96 led an invigorating arrangement of dance moves. Before the music was played, Tamika Guishard ’98 screened her production “Jackie,” as part of Taitt and Guishards’ workshop titled, “The Art of Storytelling.” The workshop was held on Saturday noon in Kemper Auditorium in celebration of Black Arts Weekend.\n“I feel like dance can be a spiritual experience. You work so hard at crafting the movement and having it align with the music, perfecting your own body… So you always have to figure out how you work within this vessel that is your body and then you have to train [your] body to do the things that you need to do. So I feel like in dance, you have to become so invested and it’s so internal because you are using your body [to tell] whatever story and express whatever art,” said Taitt.\nAfter completing her studies at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Duke University and New York University, Taitt worked for Merrill Lynch and Citigroup before starting her own organization, Art & Money Matters.\n“The mission of Art and Money Matters is to empower creative professionals in small businesses around money and numbers… What I appreciate about finance and financial analysis is that it tells a story. Numbers tell a story. It tells you whether you have cash, whether you don’t have cash. Whether you’re at a profit, you’re at a loss. How well is you company doing? What is the health of your company? What your net worth is… that’s the part I like to show people,” said Taitt.\nGuishard works in the Tribeca Film Institute, District of Columbia Public Schools and the National Park Service. Her films have been featured in Oscar-qualifying film festivals, at Harvard University and on SXSW.com.\n“I enjoy [filmmaking] because I like the collective aspect of it. I like facilitating experiences for people, where they see a different aspect of life that they maybe weren’t exposed to before. I like everything: the conversations, the critical conversations that happen after films, the debrief… Filmmaking to me is a way to just spark critical thought and being an educator is what I appreciate most about it,” said Guishard in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAfter a brief introduction by Abdu Donka ’18, Guishard presented a short lesson on a white board about the basic structure of short films, which consisted an introduction of characters, a setting, a conflict and a resolution. Guishard also emphasized the importance of the angle and position of the camera.\n“I am a believer in pedagogical filmmaking because cinema has the power to encapsulate all of the multiple intelligences to tap into the minds of different types of learners and engender concrete conversations because everyone can now speak to what they’ve seen and understood on screen. It also affords storytellers, irrespective of medium, incredible reach,” wrote Guishard in an email with The Phillipian.\nAfter screening “Jackie,” Guishard taught the audience about the techniques of filmmaking by suggesting the types of questions a good director should ask. “Jackie” is the film adaptation of a dance production that depicts a young UPenn student, Jackie, discovering throughout the film that she was born from teenage pregnancy.\n“I think something that touched me the most was when the film was played, because I felt like a lot of the scenes that were shown and a lot of shots that were shown portrayed a sort of emotion from the characters that was very, very intense… the emotion was just so raw and so real,” said Hannah Beaudoin ’17.\nFollowing Guishard’s film, Taitt led a session of traditional African dance to demonstrate iconic moves from Lamban, a West African dance created to call the natives together to tell an ancient story. Through teaching a fusion of traditional and contemporary African dance moves, Taitt wanted to bring awareness to the distinction and development of African dance.\n“Dancing from the Congo and Zambia and South Africa and Nigeria are going to [be] different from traditional to contemporary. The other thing is that it’s evolving and it’s becoming very commercial. I’m glad that there was a diversity of people here and I was able to share something with [the students] that’s more of a traditional aesthetic but use contemporary music. If people can just appreciate where it comes from first before it becomes all too commercial, then I feel like I’ve done my job,” said Taitt.\nThe audience members responded by asking intimate questions and actively participating in the dance. Students were also given the opportunity to have personal conversations with Guishard and Taitt after the workshop.\n“What I enjoyed the most was [having] two black women who [were] really [successful talk about how] the path to where they [were] going wasn’t necessarily linear and how they were discovering themselves along the way… Also, seeing their stories and how they express themselves in film and in dance… it was really beautiful and captivating,” said Mekedas Belayneh ’18.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 19, 2016'), ('\nStudents and faculty gathered in Pearson Hall on Thursday for a lunch and discussion with the Tang Institute and a team of students pioneering the Khan Academy Statistics Project.\nLeading the project is Matt Lisa, Tang Fellow and Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, and several students, including Tyler Lian ’16, Samantha Lin ’16, Samir Safwan ’16 and Claire Tao ’16.\nThe project will teach statistics through skill checks and online articles in an attempt to improve upon the traditional approach to homework.\n“[If] a student misses a class, [they’ll] read this online article on this topic that I covered today and it’s going to be more like being in class as opposed reading a textbook. [They are] going to be asked questions, [they’re] going to be answering, [they] may watch a video… a lot of sort of back and forth and none of that static ‘read the text.’ So that’s how I see it benefiting Andover,” said Lisa in an interview with The Phillipian.\nDuring the lunch and discussion, Lian said, “[A skill check] is basically a chapter review that you’d get at the end of your textbook that would review all parts of the section. It tests your knowledge to see if you really have an understanding. And so these would be small skill checks that are about six to eight pages long, and after taking it the student would see what they got right and wrong and then be directed to videos about the content, which could be really helpful.”\nThe statistics project aims to provide a more in-depth education than a regular textbook would. In addition, the online course would also be more accessible to students on campus.\nSafwan said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I think that it has already started to be integrated into the Calculus courses here. I know that in Math 590, I haven’t opened my textbook this entire year. It’s a shift in learning, I mean why use a textbook? Why carry around a really heavy book when you could just go online and have all the resources right in front of you?”\nThis project is part of the Hybrid Andover Initiative, a partnership between Phillips Academy and Khan Academy to provide “online learning experiences for students at [Andover] and for their fellow learners around the world,” according to the Tang Institute website. The project uses a method combining digital technology and the classroom experience.\nLisa said, “So there’s the idea of a flipped classroom, right? Where you’re doing all of your learning, maybe, a lot of your learning outside of class, through either video or some other online content that the student’s engaging with on their own. And there’s sort of the traditional classroom, where the teacher’s at the board and they do all the lecturing up front and they deliver the content in that way, and then you go home and on your own, by yourself, you are doing problems and trying to get to the answers there. So I kind of see the hybrid approach as a mixture of the flipped classroom and the traditional.”\nSafwan said during the lunch and discussion, “Right now we’re also focusing on making it friendly for all different types of technology. For instance, you will be able to access Khan Academy soon on your cellphones, your computers, iPads.”\n\n featured \n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nAfter students and faculty enjoyed homemade croissants, crêpes and other French pastries as they gathered on the floor to watch student performances for Andover’s first Fête de la Francophonie. Also known as International Francophonie Day, Andover’s Fête is an annual celebration of the French language and French-speaking culture hosted by the French Department.\nDebra Pickering, Instructor and Interim Chair in French, said during an interview with The Phillipian, “It’s kind of like the [Andover] version of [International Francophonie Day] and also brings together all of the French classes… We wanted to open up the eyes of students, to the existence of these French-speaking countries around the world and the cultures and the differences in the cultures, even though they have one common language.”\nFrench students of different levels participated in the event by performing skits and songs, presenting informational booths, making posters of Francophone countries and preparing French delicacies.\n“It is just a nice way of getting everybody involved in some way. If the students were not performing, they are likely to be displaying something on an exhibition table… The students that are not doing any active contribution in French are volunteering to clean up after work and things like that,” said Pickering.\nUp until last year, the French Department had hosted an annual poetry recitation competition. With decreasing participation in the competition, the French Department decided to bring the Fête de la Francophonie celebration to campus instead.\n“The idea of a Fête de la Francophonie was a kind of a natural way of making [the poetry competition] more of something that everyone can contribute to. You don’t have to be a poetry lover, you can be a singer, you can put a display, you can be an artist, you can recite a poem,” said Pickering.\nPickering hopes that the Fête de la Francophonie celebration will not only bring attention to the importance of the Francophone community, but will also serve as a way to tighten bonds within Andover’s French-speaking community.\n“I just think it’s a good way of involving the whole French-speaking community. We have invited francophiles around the school. [Head of School John Palfrey] speaks very good French, we sent him an invitation [along with] several members of faculty that you would never expect that speak French,” Pickering said.\nPickering emphasized the learning opportunity that this event provided to students in all French levels.\n“I think [the Fête de la Francophonie celebration] is a great way [to] communicate, in a foreign language, with someone who is better than you and with someone who is not as good as you. The fact of opening the students up to each other and creating a bigger sense of community is perhaps our main aim for tonight,” said Pickering.\nSally Pollard, Teaching Fellow in French, said “I think it’s great for students to come together to celebrate the Francophone world because a lot of people forget how vast French is in the world, and they just think about how it is spoken in France, but they don’t think that 90 percent of French speakers are in Africa. I feel like it is really important to remember when you are learning.”\nNatalie Warren ’18, a student in French 320, said she hopes that Andover’s Fête de la Francophonie becomes an annual celebration.\n“I think it is good because it has all the French classes come together and celebrate the culture of France and see what the other classes are up to,” said Warren.\nAlthough Yixuan Zhao ’18, a student in French 400, enjoyed the event and agrees that it should continue in the future, she thinks that the event should be inclusive of all students on campus, regardless of what language they take.\n“I think it would be cool to have this as an annual thing. I think it would be cool if in the next few years they also invited people who weren’t part of the French Department. This was mainly directed to the French students, so it would be neat if in the next couple of years they would open it up to a sort of school-wide thing,” said Zhao.\n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nAs a snowstorm raged outside, attendees of Professor Stephen Prothero’s talk last Friday evening listened intently as he discussed Americans’ lack of religious literacy as a civic problem and shared ways to address this issue.\n“Religion has not only personal but public power. It matters to individuals who believe in Jesus, or worship [the Hindu deity] Krishna, but it also [affects] elections… it moves military forces around the world. Religion may not make sense to you, you may not yourself be a religious person, but you can’t make sense of the world, I would argue, without making sense of religion,” said Prothero in an interview with The Phillipian.\nHis talk, titled “Religious Literacy & Diversity: How to Talk (and Think) About the ‘R’ Word in Public,” covered the importance of discussions about religion in society, as well as Prothero’s belief that claiming all religions as similar is both false and dangerous to interfaith cooperation.\n“It seems there’s a lot of people who want to talk about religion publicly in [the presidential election] now, for example, but there’s also this idea that you shouldn’t talk about religion in good company because it’s a volatile subject and people will disagree. My whole career is dedicated to talking about religion in public in a way that’s civil and informed,” said Prothero.\nProthero was invited to campus by Mary Kantor, Roman Catholic Chaplain, as a part of Andover’s celebration of World Interfaith Harmony Week. Kantor chose Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University, with the hope of sparking conversation about how students at Andover view religion.\n“We wanted to expose people to wider ways of looking at religious literacy and being exposed to other spiritual traditions… His [voice] is the scholar’s voice of who’s doing the work out there to help get [these conversations] going and help people learn who’s writing about [religion] and talking about it. He’s the guy who can do that,” said Kantor in an interview with The Phillipian.\nProthero presented four key ideas in which religions are framed: the main problem with human society, the specific religion’s solution to the problem, techniques to address the problem and exemplars whose paths the specific religion’s subscribers may follow. According to Prothero, when the world’s religions are viewed in terms of these four ideas, it is easy to see the differences between them.\n“The most popular books on the world’s religions that people read in the United States make this argument to overcome religious conflict, an effort to keep us away from religious war,” said Prothero during his presentation. “In order to do that, they try to make the argument that the religions are basically the same. In my book, and here tonight, I want to argue that that’s not true and that we have better basis for interreligious cooperation and for interfaith understanding than this false view that the religions are basically the same.”\n“There’s a certain kind of condescension that goes on there, a certain kind of resistance to the richness and diversity of these traditions that has to happen when you try to reduce them down to some sort of common denominator,” he continued.\nIn 2010, the Pew Research Center for Religion and Public Life contacted Prothero to help put together an online U.S. Religious Knowledge survey, designed to test the average American’s religious literacy.\n“On that test… the average person got 16 questions right out of 32, which is 50 perecent. I don’t know how the grading works here, but that would be an ‘F’ at [Boston University],” said Prothero.\nBreyanna Watson ’18, an attendee, recognized the importance of religious literacy to Andover students who wish to be more inclusive of people with other faiths.\n“I think the most important thing I took away is the importance for us as human beings to be religiously literate and to learn about religions that are not our own. Also, the fact that not all religions are the same. Listening to him talk about that, I realized that that’s a common thing that people say to make peace, and that you can’t have peace with difference,” said Watson in an interview with The Phillipian.\nProthero believes in the importance of honoring interfaith harmony at a diverse school like Andover and hopes to contribute by advocating for interfaith discussion and religious literacy.\n“We have a lot of people in the United States who would describe the United States as a Christian country, but all these religions are here around us. They’re here at this school, they’re here in Boston, New England and California. Now, understanding the world’s religions is a necessity to [understanding] our own neighborhoods, our own towns and our own schools,” said Prothero in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nAs an Andover student, Billy Draper ’07 spent many late nights ordering chicken and broccoli – with extra garlic sauce – from Golden Chopstick, a Chinese restaurant in Lawrence, Mass. Upon graduation, Draper started his own social company, Mobber, worked as a platform operations analyst at Facebook and eventually became an investor for Draper Associates.\nDraper was featured on the 2016 Forbes’s “30 Under 30” list in the Venture Capital category.\n“I started a company called Mobber the summer after graduating from [the University of California, Los Angeles]. In concept, it was similar to Kickstarter or IndieGogo – but instead of donating money, supporters would donate a tweet or Facebook status update. When a ‘mob’ had enough supporters, all of those tweets and status updates would be released at once, causing a sort of high-impact marketing wave,” wrote Draper in an email to The Phillipian.\nDraper was initially connected to Draper Associates through his father. An early-stage venture capital firm, Draper Associates invests in start-up companies in the hope that they burgeon into prosperous corporations. Draper Associates has invested in both Skype and Tesla.\n“In mid-2014, my dad mentioned he was considering raising an early-stage venture capital fund, Draper Associates, and asked me to join him. I saw this as an incredible opportunity to learn from my dad, and to work with highly ambitious entrepreneurs at the inception of their vision,” said Draper.\n“This is the most incredible job in the world – maybe I’d rather play in the N.B.A., but this is up there. Last week, we met with a company that is using positron reactions to propel micro-satellites through space – and yes, that’s a real thing. I also enjoy our alignment with entrepreneurs; after we make an investment, there’s a feeling of comradery, that we’re all in this together,” he continued.\nArriving on campus at the age of 14 from California, Draper found that the Andover experience pushed him out of his comfort zone and challenged his sense of confidence.\n“It’s impossible to quantify the impact that Andover has had on my life – that’s where I learned to tie a tie, that’s where I learned to speak in front of people, that’s where I learned how to prioritize (sort of). I think a lot of the takeaways from Andover happen between the lines – the things you don’t realize you’re learning while you’re learning them,” said Draper.\nDraper established personal connections with several faculty members, including Stephanie Curci, Instructor in English; Shirley Veenema, former Instructor in Art; Andrea Thorn, former House Counselor of Thompson House; Albert Cauz, former Abbot Cluster Dean and Instructor in Spanish; Bobby Edwards, former Dean of Community and Multicultural Development; and David Fox, Instructor in English and Art History.\nDraper was in Fox’s English 200 class and played on Andover Boys Water Polo, which Fox coached.\nFox wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I remember [Draper] as a rare amalgamation of seeming oppositions: rebellious and deferential, driven and carefree, intense and hilarious. As the most memorable students do, he took intellectual risks and didn’t spend his time trying to discern what I wanted but rather he just did what he wanted. He always had a healthy disregard for convention, yet he was highly teachable and coachable.”\nCurci taught Draper in English 300 and recalled Draper’s notable sense of humor.\n“We read a piece by Jack Handey from ‘The New Yorker’ in class. He read it aloud perfectly and got the humor immediately. I tried it with other classes that year and the next, and no one ever got the jokes in the same way. That felt like such a telling moment,” wrote Curci in an email to The Phillipian.\nDraper said, “I spent 99 percent of my available brain capacity during high school thinking about girls, so anyone who could squeeze into that last one percent had to be a highly effective teacher or mentor.”\nTo current students, Draper emphasized making the most of the time on campus and utilizing all the resources Andover has to offer.\n“Do stuff. Just do stuff. Make movies, record music, plan an event, host a radio show, join the improv group, try out for SLAM, start a small business. You are a teenager living in a time when it has never been easier to create, and never been easier to share, and you are a node in one of the most powerful networks in the world,” said Draper.\nDraper added, “Am I going to get censored for dropping too much real knowledge here?”\n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nNoah Rachlin, Tang Fellow and Instructor in History, began his project, called “I Can’t Do That… Yet,” in the spring of 2014 as a school-wide initiative to help the Andover community embrace failure and struggle. The project aims to promote the idea that mistakes have real value, and it is underscores the growth mindset, a concept that individuals can develop their abilities through hard work and perseverance.\nA graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), Rachlin was approached by the “Harvard Ed Magazine” last month for his project on growth mindset at Andover.\nRachlin said in an interview with The Phillipian, “We are trying to work with teachers and students to try to cultivate a learning disposition with the idea that it’s going to help students achieve their greatest level of success both while they’re here and once they leave Andover and embark on whatever comes next.”\nRachlin was inspired to begin his project after reflecting upon his experience as an instructor in History at Andover. Realizing that failure is often perceived negatively within the Andover community, Rachlin was determined to help students overcome this common misconception. His project encourages students to regard failure as an opportunity to learn from their mistakes.\n“There are tons of clichés about the value of hard work, how you shouldn’t be deterred by failure. But, in my experience in the classroom, I’ve felt that a lot of these cliches don’t actually follow through… This struck me as really dangerous, because it means that there’s a really profound missed opportunity around learning, taking risks and embracing challenge,” said Rachlin.\nSince the 2014-2015 academic school year, Lowers and Uppers, who are chosen at random, have met with Rachlin once a week for a term at a time to discuss various educational philosophies and methods to incorporate his strategies at Andover.\nLily Augus ’16, a participant in the program during Winter Term last year, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “One thing that stuck with me is the idea of a growth mindset as opposed to a fixed mindset… We are all capable of learning everything that we want to know, and it’s our own mindsets that prohibits us from doing so.”\nAnother facet of Rachlin’s program includes working with faculty members to encourage all students to practice growth mindset in the classroom.\n“In my own classes, I talk explicitly about concepts such as the growth mindset. I try to have [my students] reflect on the work that they’ve done and talk about moving forward,” said Rachlin.\nWhile Rachlin has received mainly positive feedback for the new initiative, he believes it has been difficult for the faculty to fully gauge the effectiveness of the program.\n“As teachers, we don’t necessarily know what students are taking away from our courses. We can always try to measure these things, but we don’t always know what they get out of our lessons,” said Rachlin.\nThough the program was initially designed to foster student development in academic settings, participants have been able to apply what they have learned from the program to sports fields, theater classes and other aspects of their lives.\n“We actually reconvened a few weeks ago, and I think what was interesting for me was that for each kid, [the impacts of the program] manifested differently,” said Augus.\nCommunity members involved with Rachlins’s program, such as Augus, are looking to get more Andover members involved.\n“I wish that we had more time to meet and to fit [the program] into our schedules on a daily basis… I also think that it would be critical for teachers to be trained in this and to go through the same program that we went through,” said Augus.\n“I think it’s important for us to remember that life is interdisciplinary, so that is certainly a part of this work [for the program],” said Rachlin.\n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nFour Empathy and Balance curriculum coordinators were chosen as part of Andover’s 2014 Strategic Plan.\nAnny Candelario Escobar, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science; Erin Strong, Instructor in Theatre and Dance; Taylor Ware, Associate Director of College Counseling; and Aya Murata, Associate Director of College Counseling will officially assume their roles as coordinators of the Empathy and Balance curriculum the next school year.\nIn the upcoming years, the coordinators will work to ensure that students across all four grades are exposed to a curriculum that not only emphasizes individual well-being, but also fosters a culture of mutual respect and understanding among students and faculty members alike.\nCarol Israel, Ph.D., Co-Director of Wellness Education, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “[The coordinators will] oversee the recruitment of teachers and the training of teachers (both faculty teachers and student teachers), develop and revise the curriculum, build alliances and create support for the [Empathy and Balance] program.”\nThe new coordinators will promote the growing effort on campus to integrate wellness in Andover’s educational program. These efforts will include incorporating social-emotional learning in the classroom, re-examining the athletics program and increasing study-abroad opportunities so that students can be exposed to various cultures.\nIn particular, the new curriculum aims to expand the Personal and Community Education (PACE) seminar that is currently designed exclusively for Lowers into a more comprehensive, multi-year curriculum.\nStrong said, “I call what we do in PACE the 100-200 level… We’re going to be fleshing out what would be a 100 level, looking at sex-ed, personal identity, stress management, community education and diversity.”\nStrong continued, “What would a 200-level look like? What would a 500-level look like? How can Seniors engage in these topics differently than [Juniors]? Each grade level explores [these topics] in different ways.”\nThe coordinators plan to lay out objectives that are unique to each grade level while incorporating more sexual health and stress-management education into the Empathy and Balance curriculum. Through these programs, coordinators hope to positively affect the mental and physical health of students while also encouraging students to be empathetic towards each other’s experiences in an intentionally-diverse community.\n“I hope [students will] take away some awareness of themselves [from the Empathy and Balance curriculum], of who they are and [take] time to reflect and really think about that. Because we move so fast [at Andover],  we don’t always take time to think about what are your own needs and how do you really identify – what’s really at the core of you,” said Strong.\nThe curriculum is still in its early stage of development, with specific aspects of the program still being considered and discussed.\nStrong said, “We don’t know all that it will entail yet… The new curriculum won’t be implemented fully across all four years until – not next year, but the year after. So next year we’ll continue fleshing out what the curriculum looks like… it will be a lot of the topics you explore in PACE, that include your personal identity and community identity… And then I think there’ll be some new pieces that we haven’t been able to get to yet, like ‘How do you do Andover well? How do you live well here?’ ”\nUtilizing their own diverse experiences to create a unique program in the Andover community, the coordinators hope to revolutionize the way in which Andover students think about personal wellness for the better.\nWare said, “As someone who has worked in more clinical school counseling roles at other schools, I am feeling quite fortunate to have the chance to draw upon my experience and be part of this exciting initiative for the [Andover] community. I am really looking forward to digging into this work with the other course heads and with the longstanding members of the [Empathy and Balance] committee and am feeling so lucky to be part of the team.”\nOverall, the coordinators anticipate that the Empathy and Balance curriculum will help students engage in a community that strives to sustain academic excellence and encourage appreciation of diversity.\n“[I hope the students learn] some skills of how to engage in our community that moves fast, that wants rigor and excellence… and then how to engage in a diverse community,” Strong said.\n\n', 'Feb 12, 2016'), ('\nFemale students gathered in The Nest on Wednesday evening to engage in a Skype session with Jessica Livingston ’89, the co-founder of Y Combinator, a company that works to help startups launch new projects, gain more users and raise more money. Since its launch in 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 1,000 early startup companies including Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit.\nDuring the event, Livingston shared her personal experience getting involved in startups and empowered more girls to study in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.\n“Just expose yourself… if you want to start a startup, it is super advantageous to know how to build the product yourself… We have a lot of female founders that we fund and a lot of them are not technical… They have so much trouble finding a technical co-founder… so they’re really at a disadvantage,” said Livingston during her presentation.\nAccording to Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, the purpose of the all-female Girls’ Night Out event was to encourage more girls to occupy spaces related to STEM fields, such as The Nest.\n“Equity and inclusion [are two] big parts of our strategic plan. So we became aware that [The Nest] was once such space… [Michael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services] in fact thought about this event as an opportunity to bring girls together to occupy that space… so he really wanted to make sure that girls would know very deliberately that this is a place that they should go to, participate in the activities there and feel welcome,” said Vidal during an interview with The Phillipian.\n“I think [the event] really was a time and place for girls only to really talk about these issues of [gender inequality in STEM fields]…” but I think it was really a good space, where we can [learn from Livingston’s experience] and later talk about issues that pertain to us and how we can promote change,” said Rosa Morona ’16, an attendee of the event.\nAfter graduating from Andover, Livingston attended Bucknell University and majored in English. At Bucknell, Livingston recalled specifically avoiding to take STEM courses due to the crippling grades she had received from her math and science classes at Andover.\n“I sort of hid from my problems back then… I hid from these things rather than [trying] to solve my problems and… [working] a little bit harder,” said Livingston.\nLivingston, after having worked in an investment bank and then in public relations, was introduced to the startup industry. Her passion for startup grew when, in 2003, she met her husband, Paul Graham, a programmer who built a startup company and sold it to Yahoo.\nAccording to Livingston, options for funding and information about startups at the time were limited, so she and her husband decided to start their firm, Y Combinator.\n“We thought there was [a] real missing piece, the funding world was just broken… So we thought, [that] there’s a lot of people that should be starting startups that aren’t. They are going to get a job at Google because there’s no really other options than that. So [my husband] said, ‘Okay, let’s just launch something [of our own]’, ” said Livingston.\nLivingston hopes her presentation encouraged more girls to consider pursuing startup industries and STEM fields.\n“I hope that [students] will consider starting a startup one day as an option for their own careers. There is so much innovation happening in the tech world and to be part of that is a wonderful and rewarding thing. It’s also an amazing feeling to pursue an idea and build your own company around it,” said Livingston in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe event was an extension of the Brace Fellow Presentation by Sadie Holmes ’16, “Women in STEM: Why So Few?” In her presentation, Holmes discussed the impact of gender roles and minimal involvement of girls in STEM fields.\n“We merged the [event with Holmes’s presentation with] the desire to continue that conversation. We heard after [Holmes’s] presentation from a lot of different people that people wanted opportunities to take the topics that Sadie presented and to try to be deliberate in acting about them and to try to make our community more gender-inclusive… So the two ideas sort of merged together into this event,” said Vidal.\nJocelyn Shen ’18, an event attendee, said, “I think [this event] was just really interesting hearing about startups because I hear people talk about them all the time, but no one ever takes a second to actually sit down, have a discussion, understand why they are important and [how] they can make a big impact.”\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nIn response to the declining utilization of physical libraries, Stack Life, a web application aimed to promote the usage of libraries, was launched at Andover this week in a joint effort between Darius Lam ’17 and North Of Boston Library Exchange (NOBLE).\nInspired by the Stack Life program currently implemented at Harvard Law School, Stack Life at Andover aims to assist students in the research process and allow users to virtually organize books and browse the stacks of the OWHL.\nLam was the lead developer and task manager of Stack Life.

For me, I know I found a lot of books about artificial intelligence, something that I’m really interested in, through the software.”\nStack Life aims to make the stacks of the library more interactive and engaging. Users can “tag” books and create their own stacks of books based on subjects, or merge all of the stacks together into a single bookshelf.\nMichael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services, said in a phone interview with The Phillipian, “[With Stack Life, students] can just search the stacks from their dorm room or [the] day student lounge without actually having to go to the library.”\n“If we look at, say, the stacks, we have different shelves of books,” said Lam. “Stack Life can [combine] all those shelves together to make this really big stack that you can browse all of the books from. It can also create new stacks as well, like all the books that are related to brains or artificial intelligence.”\n“It’s supposed to be more intuitive and help people discover more books because you can visualize hundreds of books on a single stack,” Lam continued.\nStack Life not only looks to promote the continuation of libraries, but it also allows users to browse libraries with more ease.\n“I feel like one turnaround for students using the library is that [they’ll say], ‘Where do I get started?’ [and] ‘How do I use this?,’” said Lam. “Stack Life gives students access to the same information, but gives it in a way that’s much more intuitive to use and [in a way] they already know how to use.”\nBarker initially contacted Lam to help bring Stack Life from Harvard to Andover.\nLam said, “We all know that libraries are… kind of dying out because of lack of funding and [the thought of], ‘Why do people need to go to the stacks if they have information online?’ One of the ways Stack Life tries to help [with the continuation of libraries] is by bringing back the idea of serendipitous discovery.”\n“We called it Stack Life because we wanted to represent the library stacks in a way that didn’t seem so dead… Through the application, you can create new stacks and you can visualize the library in different ways, which is why we called it ‘life.’ So we made it a little more alive, hopefully,” he continued.\nLam hopes Stack Life will allow students to explore their interests and help engage their research process.\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nMarcello Rossi ’16 launched an online platform to connect students with Andover Alumni for mentorship and internship opportunities this week.\nAfter witnessing widespread stress over post-graduation internship opportunities, Rossi created Andover Mentorship Internship Network (AMIN) during his co-president campaign last year, to better connect current students with Andover alumni.\n“In Upper year, when I was running for the co-presidency, I saw that a lot of my classmates were going through this [internship opportunity] anxiety, and I thought to myself, what’s a practical avenue that can help alleviate stress and help students gain a broader perspective?” said Rossi.\n“I thought this anxiety was due to being enclosed in the Andover bubble and not being able to see beyond where our academics led to,” Rossi continued.\nRossi found that increasing the availability of alumni connections would allow students more internship opportunities.\n“I wanted to be able to offer a resource that connected students with internships and mentorship opportunities outside of Andover, so students can gain a broader perspective on where to apply the knowledge that we are learning here,” said Rossi.\nEmploying a first-come, first-serve method via an email to all Uppers, AMIN welcomed 33 students into the network.\n“You acquire internships through connections, and so therefore I thought creating a resource, or being able to give equal access to the Andover Alumni Network to promote internships, would be more fair and equitable for students to get mentors and internships,” Rossi continued.\nReflecting on his own experience with internships, Rossi recognized the value in having the opportunity to use his knowledge from Andover in scenarios off-campus.\n“I had worked on a couple of internships during the summer before my Upper year, and I knew, I just realized how valuable they were to me in helping me see where my knowledge can be applied from Andover. So, I thought, ‘Why not create a resource that helps all Andover students gain access to internships?’” Rossi continued.\nRossi hopes that AMIN will provide equal access to internships and alumni mentors for all Andover students.\n“I think that alumni are also willing to volunteer [at Andover] in ways other than monetarily – just donating. I think this is a very hands-on way for alumni to make an impact on the student life,” said Rossi.\nOne alum connected on AMIN, Nathaniel Fowler ’99, offers internship opportunities at real estate private equity company, Lauderhill Partners.\n“[I’m] always looking to help Andover alumni trying to figure out their career plans. I would have really enjoyed connecting with our alumni throughout the world [when I was a student at Andover],” wrote Fowler in an email to The Phillipian.\nWhile AMIN helps connect students to alumni, Rossi hopes students can be proactive in taking advantage of these connections.\n“I think the biggest challenge will be for students to really take the bull by the horns and contact alumni. Because while they are in contact, I think students need to be proactive in reaching out to these alumni and seeking out the mentorship from [themselves],” said Rossi.\nRossi believes connecting alumni to AMIN will prove easier if students are eager.\n“Another challenge is also definitely getting alumni on board, but I think it’s easier to get alumni on board when the students are enthusiastic. The main thing I’m looking for is hopefully that the students take on the initiative and are enthusiastic about it, and it’s shown we could get more alumni on the network and make it a lot more valuable,” said Rossi.\nAlthough he came up with the idea of AMIN on his own, Rossi received help from an outside computer contractor in London to build the website after obtaining funds from an Abbot Grant. Rossi also received help from Jacques Hugon, Senior Technology Partner for the Tang Institute, and from the Alumni Relations Office.\nThrough the help of his own contacts, Rossi was able to expand AMIN’s list of alumni connections.\n“I started off with a list that I acquired from my own personal connections. And from there, I asked [the Alumni Engagement Office] to spread the work of the internship website. Basically it was kind of just like a blow-out effect, where the first ring would reach out to their connections in their grade. It grew [in] that way,” said Rossi.\nRossi will be on the lookout for younger students to take over AMIN once he graduates if the site proves successful this year.\n“I’ll be looking for people to maintain it… But yeah it depends, if it’s successful, it will continue over to next year. Hopefully, as long as it grows, the more it grows, the more potential we’ll have to keep it going in the future,” said Rossi.\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nBy having casual conversations with young kids, volunteers for SIS – which used to be an acronym for Sisters in Service – aim to encourage children in The Boys & Girls Club of Lawrence to reflect on various themes such as self-esteem and gender roles every Wednesday.\nHaley Avery ’16, the Student Coordinator for the program, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “SIS is an opportunity for a volunteer and a child to connect one-on-one even for ten or 15 minutes at the end of a long day… It’s about forming connections and just talking to the [kids] about their day.”\nDuring the program, volunteers engage the kids in fun activities such as creating bird feeders with fruit loops and pipe cleaners, making snow paint with shaving cream and glue and building towers out of toothpicks, cards and tape.\nWhen it first launched, SIS was a program that focused on teaching and empowering young girls, but Avery decided to open it up to children in all genders after she became the Student Coordinator for the program in the fall of 2014.\n“I wanted to take [SIS] slightly in a different direction… I decided to expand it to both boys and girls because it would become more of an after-school program and with less of that one-on-one mentorship… I thought it might be more effective if we opened it up… We just wanted to make sure that both male volunteers and male kids felt very welcome coming to our program,” said Avery.\nAvery feels that the mentorship program has the potential to make a true difference in the lives of both the participant kids and volunteers.\n“One of the big things I’ve learned is the power of small interactions and small moments on both the volunteers’ day and the kids’ day,” said Avery. “It can feel like a very casual program because kids are running in and out – but at the end of the day, you see kids become really attached to a volunteer and really look forward to them coming back.”\nIn addition, Avery believes that an important aspect of the program is encouraging innovation and creativity.\n“I think the best part of the program is seeing kids use this raw material and just have a lot of fun with it being incredibly creative about it,” said Avery.\nMany volunteers feel that SIS allows them to take a break from their daily routines and enjoy interacting with new people.\nMekedas Belayneh ’18, a volunteer at SIS, said, “During the week, it’s really stressful at school, and being able to leave campus and talk to a lot of people much younger than you while doing fun activities is a great way for me to de-stress, and it’s a great way to learn about new people.”\nTiffany Chang ’19, another volunteer of the program, said, “I thought [SIS] is a really nice way to give back to the community in a way that I can have fun and learn things myself. I think there are a lot of things about having fun that we remember as children that we lose as we grow older, and I think accessing that side of myself was also important for me.”\nWithout a strict weekly roster of kids, the program is open to all members of the Boys & Girls Club of Lawrence. Looking forward to the rest of the year, Avery hopes to incorporate more games and activities into the program for more structured time with the kids.\nEditor’s Note: Haley Avery was the Chief Financial Officer for The Phillipian, vol.

Invited by the Jewish Student Union (JSU), Pinsky came to Andover and launched this year’s Jewish Cultural Weekend with his presentation titled “Jewish Imagination.”\n“I’ll begin by confessing to you that the title [of the presentation,] ‘Jewish Imagination,’ [is something] I always wanted to put it in quotation marks, but that seemed a little fussy. It’s partly a rather nasty history joke. Some of you know that in the history of the fascist, anti-Semitic regimes, Jewish art and Jewish psychology is a term of contempt and hatred from others, and I don’t believe there is a Jewish imagination,” said Pinsky during his presentation.\nPinsky read three of his poems: “Samurai Song,” “Poem With Refrains” and “Impossible to Tell.”\nInstead of a formal and routinely presentation, Pinsky engaged his audience in conversation as his talk went on. After each poem, audience members had the chance to ask Pinsky questions. Topics of the questions ranged from his word choices to his belief on how his identity have affected his poetic career and his sources of inspiration.\n“It’s hard to pick one [source of inspiration], but Emily Dickinson is important to me, Gerard Manley Hopkins is important to me. I like 16th or 17th century poets. What could be better than that? Fulke Greville, Ben Johnson, Emily Dickinson. I tend to like poetry by dead people,” said Pinsky in response to a question asking him about poetic styles that influence his writing.\nPinsky also shared advice to burgeoning young poets in attendance.\n“Create your own anthology. Type it up with your own fingers. It is the most personal piece of work you can do, in certain ways, while in school. It is yours. It is a self-portrait in taste,” said Pinsky.\nOne of the key points that Pinsky emphasized in “Jewish Imagination” was that an artist does not have to be defined by labels related to their identity. He presented the idea that no matter who you are or what you believe in, your concept of the world is always being changed by those you are close to, said Pinsky.\n“I tend to be very skeptical of all forms of purity. I don’t think there is any ‘pure’ American, there’s no pure black sensibility… we use these generalities like Asian, or Native American or Hispanic. [These terms] apply to multiple cultures. There was not one culture on this continent before the Europeans came here. And none of us is purely one particular thing,” said Pinsky.\nPinsky believes that the idea of sharing and adopting one another’s faith and identity influences the creation of his poems.\nJewish Cultural Weekend is an event hosted by JSU, that explores the various facets of Judaism on our campus and beyond.\n“We kind of brainstormed last year about what we wanted to do with this weekend,” said Chaya Holch ’17, a board member of JSU who helped plan Pinsky’s lecture. “The board decided that we wanted to do something different, so over the summer I looked into the different options, local options mostly, of famous Jewish writers, and Dr. Pinsky came up as one of the prominent ones on the list, and he lives relatively nearby, and obviously he’s a very important poet, and so we as a group decided to bring him to campus this weekend.”\nRabbi Michael Swarttz, faculty advisor to JSU, said, “Jewish Cultural Weekend is an annual opportunity to share various aspects of Jewish culture with the larger Andover community. I believe I have records in my files of the event going back about 12 or 13 years, but it may be [even] older than that.”\nEditor’s Note: Chaya Holch is a Managing Editor for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nMembers of The Phillipian vol.

CXXXIX, a board featuring a seven-person Upper Management consisting of Editorial, Digital and Business Upper Managements.\nUnder the leadership of CXXXVIII, The Phillipian established Staff Writer positions, launched a redesigned website, advanced the digitalization of the paper and operated a pay-free subscription for all members on campus.\nSara Luzuriaga ’16, former Editor in Chief of The Phillipian, said, “[The newsroom is] a really special place. You meet really special people and you are doing a really incredible thing – making a paper each week. I think it is so important to make the most of it because it goes so quickly. Thirty weeks seems like a long time, but standing on the other end of it and looking back at all the time I spent here, I think sometimes I didn’t do as much with that time as I could have.”\nJuju Lane ’17, former Features Editor, will replace Luzuriaga as Editor in Chief, as well as assuming the role of President of The Phillipian.\nLane said, “I learned from Sara that even if you don’t know someone, it’s important to be open and friendly and [to] get to know everyone, even if it’s kind of hard at first, because I was really scared of her for quite a while. I’m in her dorm and I would see her in the bathroom and I would be so scared, like ‘Am I brushing my teeth right?’ But she always treated me with so much respect, and she treats everyone with so much respect, and that’s something that I’m striving to be like.”\nLuzuriaga said, “I think Juju is above all very, very smart. Coming from Features, she has taken a lot of the lessons she learned about writing a humor section in the community newspaper and used those lessons to learn more about journalism and the paper as a whole. I think she has really great instincts, instincts that are really unique in someone of her age. I have 100 percent faith in her.”\nA re-established editorial Upper Management position in CXXXIX is the role of Executive Editor, which will be fulfilled by Alexa Tsay ’17, former Associate Sports Editor.\n“We wanted to add the Executive Editor position so that the Editor in Chief could have more freedom to do larger scale projects and work more with the other boards. So the Executive Editor, now Alexa, will be doing a lot of editing and she will be taking a lot of the burden off of Juju so that [Juju] can do these different projects,” said Luzuriaga.\n“I’m looking forward to getting to know [CXXXIX] and I think we’re all going to work together really well. I’m looking forward to everything we can accomplish,” said Tsay.\nChaya Holch ’17, former Associate Commentary Editor, and Jack Twomey ’17, former Associate Copy Editor, will succeed Avery Jonas ’16, Erica Shin ’16 and Skylar-Bree Takyi ’16 as Managing Editors.\n“I think that Managing Editors are there to create the environment that you want for the newsroom,” said Takyi. “In my opinion, they’re there to be accessible. Whoever the newsroom needs them to be, they need to be that person. If they [need] to be stern, then that. Whoever the newsroom requires them to be.”\nShin said, “I think [CXXXIX is] going to be bold, which was something we weren’t. We were pretty careful as a paper but… I think they’re going to push boundaries.”\nWhen asked about her favorite memory with CXXXVIII, Takyi replied, “To be honest, most of [my favorite memories] are too inappropriate for this paper.

Both Ally Klionsky ’17, former Associate Layout Editor, and Rudd Fawcett ’18, former Associate Online Editor, will take over responsibilities previously held by Pranav Tadikonda ’16.\n“I picked Ally and Rudd together because I think they compliment each other very well. They both bring two unique skill sets. Rudd is a little more technically focused, and Ally is a little bit more visually focused, but I also chose them because I see in both of them the capacity to grow and improve, and really develop into the kind of person that has to cover the multi-faceted EDE role,” said Tadikonda.\nSabrina Lu ’17, former Business Associate, will replace Haley Avery ’16 as Chief Financial Officer.

I really saw that in her from day one,” said Avery.\n“Connor, Wendy and Kristy are incredibly strong members of this board. Connor is so friendly and so down to do anything.

Nancy Kim ’17 and Sewon Park ’17, former Associate Commentary Editors, will succeed Alessa Cross ’16 and Tyler Lian ’16 as Commentary Editors.\n“I think that Commentary will continue this momentum of just great personal articles that really show to the community who its members really are and what they’re thinking,” said Cross. “I think that Commentary will just continue to be an important springboard for discussion, and allow members of this community to get to know each other more and be more empathetic.” Lian said, “I think Nancy has a good sense of writing style, I think she’s definitely picked up a lot of what we’ve been telling her over the past few years. More specifically, I think she’ll be a calming presence in the newsroom that will secure the Commentary section.

Being able to write about topics that can kind of blend in sometimes can be a challenge, but knowing Kalina and Morgan, I really think that they can rise to that challenge.”\nFormer Associate Sports Editors Laura Bilal ’17, Cassie Chin ’17, Howard Johnson ’17 and Andrew Zhang ’17 will replace Victoria Bergeron ’16, Isabella Haegg ’16 and Peter Hahn ’16 as Sports Editors.\nBergeron said, “Because sports is going from eight people working on the section to four, that means [the workload] is doubling per person. That’s definitely the biggest challenge – readjusting to that and also getting used to working with [CXXXIX], but I think that’s also one of the best parts, is when you get the newsroom alone for the first time because you realize how much emptier and easier to maneuver it is.”\nPeter Rossano ’17, Jair Suazo ’17 and Emma Wong ’18, former Associate Copy Editors, will replace Sayer Devlin ’16, Kyle Kingston ’16 and Olivia Michaels ’16 as Copy Editors.\n“Trust nobody because you never know who is going to make a mistake. The only section that knows what they are doing is Copy,” said Devlin.\n“I think that [the Copy Editors] will really push the paper forward instead of falling back on old habits and relying on old style guides.

Both previous Photo Editors trust that Hamann and Wolfe will be able to capture the importance of teamwork in their new positions.\n“I think the two of them get along really well, and it’s definitely going to be a challenge to groom the next generation of photographers, but I really think that communicating with them and making them feel comfortable, giving them constructive criticism, is what they’re going to do best at,” said Luo.\nWith the 139th board, Video is looking to play a bigger part in the digitalization of the paper.

Graber was a three-time league All-Star in the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL) for the Amsterdam Mohawks, formerly known as the Schenectady Mohawks.\nThe PGCBL is a ten-team Major League Baseball-sanctioned college summer league in upstate New York. Graber played for the Mohawks for three consecutive seasons in 1988, 1989 and 1990. While on the team, Graber contributed to PGCBL league championship titles in 1988 and 1990. In 1990, Graber batted .389 and finished fourth in the league in hitting before representing the Mohawks at the College Summer All-Star Game held at the Stade Olympique in Montreal, Canada.\nWith thousands of people in attendance, Graber, along with former Mohawk Brendan Harris, was inducted into the Hall of Fame during a ceremony held in Amsterdam, N.Y., this past weekend.\nGraber said, “When I got the email from the General Manager, I was a little surprised because [playing for the Mohawks] was a long time ago, but I was also really honored and really flattered that people there still remember me.”\nAlmost three decades have passed since Graber played for the Mohawks, but receiving the award allowed him to reflect upon his time with the team.\n“When something like this happens and you’re recognized for something you did long ago,” he said, “it makes you remember some stuff that you haven’t thought about in a while and that’s kind of fun.”\n“I was 19, 20-years old, and a lot of time has gone by since,” he continued. “I don’t always sit around thinking about those summers I had with that group of friends and the people I met, all the bus rides, the trips to McDonald’s, the games, the fans in the stands and the coaches that I had.”\nGraber will always remember the unique small-town atmosphere of Amsterdam and his intimate relationship with the Mohawks fans. “It’s one of those little towns in upstate New York that’s frozen in time, like nothing ever changes and there’s not much else that happens in that town. This team and this league are the [big] thing there; they’ll get 3,000 people going to the games and all those people are still there and they all remember you,” Graber said.\nEach year, the Mohawks play a 50-game schedule from June through August against teams around upstate New York. Playing their home games at Shuttleworth Park in Amsterdam, N.Y., the Mohawks tend to draw crowds of about 2,500 to 3,000 fans per game.\nGraber said, “The Mohawks have grown into one of the top places to play summer baseball in America. The players will note that the game atmosphere at Shuttleworth Park is one of the best in the country, with large, enthusiastic crowds and highly-involved kids.”\nAfter his career with the Mohawks, Graber played and managed professional baseball, played in Australia, coached at various colleges, including Amherst College and then joined the coaching staff and Admissions team at Andover in 2008. When he first arrived, Graber served as coach for the team, and was appointed to the Head Coach role during his second year at Andover.\nGraber has helped the Andover Baseball team clinch seven consecutive Central New England Prep Final Four appearances, including back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.\nAlthough Graber’s baseball career has evolved far past his time in Amsterdam, N.Y., he continues to treasure his experiences there. “It’s comforting to know that people remember and appreciate something you invested so much time in, like it was worth something. [Playing for the Mohawks] was the whole sum of my investment of time and energy during that [time], so the fact that it still lives on is reaffirming,” he said.\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nFlipping through PowerPoint slides at her talk in Kemper Auditorium on Wednesday, artist and curator Katarina Wong landed on an image detailing a rhizome, a plant structure that grows laterally. Attendees of her presentation came to discover how rhizomes represent intersections between Wong’s faith and her art.\n“Rhizomic plant structures grow in ways so that they’re always searching for the most optimal growth conditions, I think the rhizome is the perfect metaphor for these kinds of… forces that enact in our lives and take us off of our linear courses… [Rhizomic forces in our lives], like with plants, are looking for our optimal conditions of growth. For me, that really begins with Buddhism and religion in a larger context,” said Wong.\nWong was invited to campus by Mary Kantor, Ph.D., Roman Catholic Chaplain, as a part of Andover’s first World Interfaith Harmony Week, which the United Nations has commemorated since 2011. The celebration of all faiths and spiritual traditions was proposed last spring as a way to supplement the conversation about intersectionality on campus, and to highlight another aspect of student identity.\n“I thought of [Wong] because she does work in Buddhism, she’s crossing ethnic identities, national identities, and her art has been formed across all these things. She seemed like somebody who could speak to lots of aspects of what we’re trying to do… I was looking at her artwork again, and I was thinking she’d be a good voice to touch on a lot of aspects of faith,” said Kantor.\nThe talk, titled “Buddhism, Monkey Mind, Chaos and Connections” covered four main experiences illustrating how unexpected events in life can take people off their linear courses. Discussing the importance of her Buddhist faith to the development of her artwork, Wong reflected on how these uncontrollable forces shifted her life and shaped her work.\nOne event included her father’s death in 2009. After her grief took her away from painting for a few months, Wong was able to return to painting with a different mindset.\n“This kind of chaotic grief actually took me out of the studio for a couple months… And when I came back to the studio, my work shifted completely. Prior to [my father’s death], I’d been making very large scale, very colorful paintings… and instead of painting delicate bamboo and birds, I just started throwing [out this technique].”\nAlthough she has been creating art from a young age, Wong first became interested in religion when her parents sent her to an evangelical middle school. This fascination resurfaced during her time at St. John’s College, during which she attended a seminar on the Christian story of creation.\n“If we believe that we are made in the image of the divine… we are co-creators… That was a really powerful way of me understanding our place as humans in this massive universe… It got me really interested in how other world religions dealt with the same mystery. I started reading a lot of different texts, and got very interested in contemporary Buddhist writers,” said Wong during her presentation. Buddhist ideals have greatly influenced Wong’s artwork. A series of her installations called the “Fingerprint Project” incorporated the Buddhist concept of dependent origination – the belief that reality is objective and co-created by humanity. Using molds taken from the fingertips of thousands of people, Wong co-created patterned sculptures with every participant.\n“I wanted to see if that was just a pretty idea, or if it were actually true… I wanted to make work that was co-creative. I took molds of friends and family and strangers, all their fingertips, so that the pieces were literally dependent on everyone’s participation, ” said Wong.\n“Buddhism is a system that speaks [most] closely to my experience of the world. It’s focused on interconnectedness. It’s kind of a radical idea that’s a little bit different than some of the other religions… These are all ideas that are really relevant to me. I find them fascinating in how to express them and how to play with them in terms of my own work as an artist,” said Wong about her faith. Kantor hopes Wong’s talk, as well as Interfaith Harmony Week in general, raises awareness of the conversation around faith and spirituality on campus.\n“The students I’ve worked with and the conversations I’ve heard from atheist students, Muslim students… they’re all saying the same things. They want people to recognize [religion] as part of how we shape our identity. And that people know about it, respect it and want to learn more about it, and then help to get rid of some of the misunderstandings that exist around faith traditions,” said Kantor. Attendee Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19 thought it was important to have Wong speak about both her relationship with faith and her relationship with art.\n“I think it’s important for someone who has such a sense of spirituality and such a deep connection with… not just her religion but other religions around her… and [that she] be able to not just incorporate it but to use it in her life,” said Kanchinadam.\n\n', 'Feb 5, 2016'), ('\nA long-time Lincoln-Douglas (LD) debater at her middle school, Tiffany Chang ’19 was motivated to share her enthusiasm for LD debate with the Andover community upon her arrival at Andover this past fall. LD debate is structured on arguments supported by theories from well-known philosophers and requires debaters to prepare both affirmative and negative cases.\nAfter talking with her complimentary house counselor Rachel Hyland, Instructor in Spanish, and Garrett Richie, Teaching Fellow in English, Chang was able to begin an LD Debate Club on campus by the end of her Junior fall term.\n“I was in the dorm one night and had a great conversation with [Chang] about her passion for LD Debate. I was impressed with her knowledge, experience and willingness to take initiative. Although I am new to the debate world, I agreed to support her and help out wherever I could,” wrote Hyland in an email to The Phillipian.\nPrior to the debate, the competitors of LD debate are given the resolution or the problem being addressed and are required to prepare evidence for their cases. While the debater is forced to argue both sides of the case, any competing theories can be reconciled before the competition.\n“You can go for straight-up statistics and evidence, you can go for taking a more layered, philosophical approach, you can argue about the confines of the resolution itself… With [Philomathean Society], it’s usually more straightforward because it’s focused on rhetoric rather than intellectual arguments… LD has this tendency to lean more [toward] the use of strict logic to structure arguments and Philo tends to use more of common sense type arguments,” said Chang.\nA typical club meeting usually starts with learning new terms and watching videos of past competitions since most members are relatively new to this style of debate. Though LD is mostly a one-on-one competition, members train as a team and help one another edit their resolution papers.\n“[During one meeting,] we [looked] at how gun control affects other facets of society like racism… by taking guns [away], are we taking away a really integral part of the South? But at the same time, does the violence take away our basic right to live as human beings? I love it in that we can argue for any side, we can keep on going, really forever,” said Tanvi Kanchinadam ’19, a member of the club.\nAccording to Chang, she did not encounter any obstacles while creating the club. After asking Christopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, about the possibility of creating this club, Chang only needed to find a faculty advisor, a place to meet and members to take part in her club.\nChang found recruiting new students to be her largest obstacle.\n“The real issue with creating the club as a [Junior] is not knowing enough people to maintain the numbers in the club… The amount of people attending has gone down greatly since it first began. [I hope to] get more people interested in this really amazing activity,” said Chang.\nThe club will be attending an upcoming LD Debate tournament at Harvard, one of the largest of such tournaments in the country. Chang hopes to apply for a grant in the spring through the Abbot Academy Association to hire an additional coach who is familiar with LD debate.\n“[LD debate] has changed the way that I read arguments. It’s changed the way that I analyze any piece of literature that I read and it really opened my eyes especially to the fact that there isn’t really one set way of judging what is right and what is wrong… and I want more people to be able [to experience] that,” said Chang.\n\n', 'Jan 29, 2016'), ('\nWhile most students at Andover are easily categorized as either boarding or day students, some, like Eliot Zaeder ’17, fall somewhere in between. Eliot Zaeder resides on campus in Bishop Hall where he lives with his family, which includes his father, Thayer Zaeder, Instructor in Art; his mother and his younger sister.\nUnlike most Andover students, Eliot Zaeder has lived on campus since he was just one year old.\n“I’ve lived here basically my whole life… It’s definitely an interesting experience. Mostly because I get to live with my family. I’d say it’s best of both worlds,” said Eliot Zaeder.\nFor as long as he can remember, Eliot Zaeder imagined himself as an Andover student.\n“I always knew that I wanted to come [to Andover]. And I think that having my dad teaching here was kind of a plus because he could help me out with the application process and things like that. This was the only school that I applied to,” said Eliot Zaeder.\nEven before becoming a student, Eliot Zaeder spent a lot of time with Andover kids.\n“As a little kid, boys in the dorm would sometime babysit us. It was really fun, but I can’t really remember that much because I was so young. Also, before I was here as a [Junior], I sometimes went to the dorm munches and hung out with some of the boys. But not very often because obviously I was much smaller,” said Eliot Zaeder.\nIn contrast to Eliot Zaeder, Michaela Hagler ’16 finds living in a dorm to be the worst aspect of being the child of a faculty member. She lives with her father, Jeremiah Hagler, Instructor in Biology, her mother, and her two triplets in America House.\n“I feel that I do not have privacy and my own space because I can always hear the [boarding students] above me… it is almost as if I am a [boarding student], but I am a actually a day student. I don’t have that same separation from campus that the other students, whether it be boarder or day student. It is a weird mix,” wrote Michaela Hagler in an email to The Phillipian.\nSiblings Michaela Hagler and Alex Hagler ’16 also find having a faculty member as a parent to be both a positive and negative aspect of being a student at Andover.\n“In classes it can sometimes be awkward if I know the teacher from before high school, and sometimes even, my classmates or teachers will put undue expectations on me just because I am a faculty kid. But that is very rare, and most of the time my classmates and teachers just treat me as another student,” wrote Alex Hagler in an email to The Phillipian.\nJordy Fenton ’17, daughter of Martha Fenton ’83, Dean of West Quad North Cluster, enjoys the mix of boarding and day life.\n“[Having a parent who is faculty member] is nice in the fact that I can be on campus, and doing my schoolwork and everything, but also have the home life. So it’s kind of the mix between the day student and the [boarding] life, which a lot of the [boarding students] will tell me that being on campus that I’m very lucky to be here because my family is here… Plus the dog, it’s always nice to have the dog around,” said Jordy Fenton.\nAnother student who falls in the middle of the boarding-day student spectrum is Reuben Philip ’18. Unlike most faculty kids, Reuben does not have the same all-day accessibility to Andover’s facilities as other faculty members’ children do because he lives off campus.\n“I think living on campus would be a benefit for me just being around the whole community at all times would be pretty cool… I think that’s good because you get to sort of be away from everyone for part of the day, and it’s nice to just go home… I know that some of my friends who are faculty students that live in dorms, their parents are on duty 24/7, and my parents get to step away from that,” said Philip.\nPhilip’s mother is Elizabeth Joseph, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science. On a typical day, Philip leaves campus at around 9:00 p.m. His mother will leave before him except for days when she has dorm duty. His father, Philip Theruvakattil, works as a network and firewall engineer on campus.\n“[Being] able to rely on my parents being around here is good because… I rely on them a lot, and just them being close at all times is really securing,” said Philip.\nAlthough Philip enjoys being close to his parents while at school, he said running into his parents during the school day can often be awkward.\n“It’s also pretty awkward when your friends have your parents as teachers. But otherwise, I think that it’s not much different than being a regular day student,” said Philip.\nSince coming to Andover, Philip has been able to see the difference between his peers at Andover compared to those attending other schools. He appreciates the overall friendliness and acceptance that is prevalent in Andover’s large but tight-knit community.\n“Everyone goes into everything with a positive attitude. And when you meet someone, I know anywhere else someone would judge you at first sight, but here it’s a little bit different. They actually get to know you before they judge you,” said Philip.\n\n', 'Jan 29, 2016'), ('\nAs the guest speaker for the Wellness Week All-School Meeting (ASM), Christopher Willard, Psy.D., a psychologist and educator in mindfulness for young people, presented the research and importance of managing stress in high school and beyond through mindfulness and other related practices.\n“The facts actually show that the most stressed group in America [is] the American [teenager], who have so much on their plate. So much stress and not a lot of time to figure out how to deal with it,” said Willard during the presentation.\nWillard defined mindfulness as staying focused on the present and accepting events without judgement.\nWillard cited the increasing stress levels of this generation and age, in which students are so driven to compete for spots at top universities that they begin to overbook their schedules, aim for the highest test scores and miss the present moment due to intense focus on the future.\n“There is more pressure on kids than there ever has been before, and then, at the same time, there are even fewer resources for how to deal with stress. The things that used to be fun, like sports, become very competitive and become four seasons long, rather than just one season, so it becomes like work,” said Willard in an interview with The Phillipian.\nDuring his presentation, Willard displayed a slide titled “College Facts,” which emphasized the rapidly growing issue of stress, depression and mental illness in the student population in America. Willard suggested that students practice mindfulness as a coping technique when feeling anxious or overwhelmed, and he emphasized the importance of breathing.\nWillard said, “It’s not about getting rid of stress, it’s about organizing stress… when we change our breath, we can actually change our bodies, and when we change our bodies, we can actually change how we feel.”\nAt the end of his ASM presentation, Willard led the audience in an activity called 7/11, during which he asked the audience to inhale for seven seconds and exhale for 11 seconds in order to calm the mind and body.\n“It doesn’t have to take a lot of time. We can find these little moments throughout the day where maybe we do a 7/11 breath or we do some breathing or we focus on sensations in our body,” said Willard.\nWillard first approached practicing mindfulness about 20 years ago, during some time off from Wesleyan University, and was motivated to share the benefits of mindfulness with other young adults in the world.\n“When I was in college, I was taking some time off trying to figure out what to do with my life and had my own stress-related issues. Then, I found mindfulness and just wanted to bring that into my own life and share that with other people, because it had been helpful in terms of my own mental health, my own physical health and academic performance,” said Willard in an interview with The Phillipian.\nWillard is the author of “Growing Up Mindful” and “Child’s Mind,” co-author of “The Mindfulness for Teen Depression Workbook” and a co-editor of “Teaching Mindfulness Skills to Kids and Teens.”\n\n', 'Jan 29, 2016'), ('\nWhen he was four, Leo Ullman ’57 was living away from his parents as a refugee with his “war family,” the Schimmels. After Germany invaded the Netherlands during the Holocaust in 1940, Ullman spent his days hiding from Nazi soldiers.\nUllman returned to Andover to present in Kemper Auditorium last Friday evening. A survivor of the Holocaust, Ullman recounted stories of living in secrecy and how his childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland shaped his life.\nOne of the few remaining survivors of the Holocaust, Ullman is the author of “796 Days,” a memoir which chronicles his family’s experiences in the Holocaust and his eventual escape to the United States.\n“I felt there’s a real need for people to tell the story of the Holocaust. There are very few of us left, I am probably the youngest at this point, and soon there won’t be anyone to tell the story and the story’s very, very important,” said Ullman in an interview with The Phillipian.\nHe continued, “It’s important in terms of teaching about tolerance, in terms of teaching the tremendous evils of propaganda and how effective it can be. It’s very important in today’s world to see the relevance of what happened [during the Holocaust] in terms of controlling the media and controlling the courts and the legal process: that’s relevant today.”\nGrowing up in a Jewish household in Amsterdam, Ullman and his family lived comfortably until the Nazi invasion in 1940. Ullman’s parents decided to go into hiding after his father received labor camp summons in July of 1942. Hoping to protect young Ullman, they contacted a family friend who placed him with the Schimmel family, who were total strangers. The Schimmels did not know who Ullman was – only that he was Jewish – but decided to welcome the boy into their home.\nUllman said during his presentation, “[The Schimmels] knew that if anybody knew that they were hiding a Jewish child, they would be killed… They took the ultimate risk and provided me a loving and good home, I never knowingly suffered, and it was a wonderful experience for me, needless to say I wouldn’t be here without them, and many other people who were hidden did not have this benefit.”\nIn the meantime, Ullman’s parents contacted a welfare client of his mother’s who hid them in the attic of their apartment building.\n“My parents, in the meantime, found a hiding place in an attic on the main street of Amsterdam… the attic [was] where my parents were without light, heat or electricity. They paid for that hiding place, and they lived there somehow for basically 796 days… They couldn’t make any noise when the people below them were around,” said Ullman in his presentation.\nUllman was reunited with his parents with the help of the Dutch Resistance, a secret coalition in the Netherlands that gathered intelligence from allies and destroyed communication lines.\nUllman said, “My parents, through the Resistance, learned my whereabouts and so they came to get me. At a given moment, the doorbell rang at our house and my war mother had a pretty good feeling who this would be. And we opened the door, and there were these terribly gaunt people who I didn’t recognize, and they claimed to be my parents.”\nUnable to speak English when he first arrived in the United States with his family in 1947, Ullman found his transition into American culture challenging at first.\n“It was very difficult for me. First of all, I didn’t speak a word of English… The principal of the local grade school told my mother that for the first two weeks, some of the other kids would beat me up but after that it would be okay,” said Ullman in an interview with The Phillipian.\nWhen Ullman arrived at Andover as a new Upper in 1955, he chose not to share his Holocaust background with his peers as he mainly desired to fully assimilate into American culture.\n“I did well at Andover, I loved the people and I went to Harvard, and that would never have happened but for Andover. So whatever happened in my life, I feel is very largely attributable to my time at Andover, which I loved,” said Ullman.\nHe continued, “I never talked about my Holocaust background at Andover, it was never something that I trumpeted at all… At Andover at that point, there were maybe five Jews in our class of 220 and maybe a couple of blacks, and that was really largely it. So it was a different environment and for me, it was okay.”\nDespite being placed in an unfamiliar environment, Ullman found comfort in playing the cello.\n“What was really amazing was that every Sunday I was allowed to go into Boston and take [cello] lessons with a member of the Boston Symphony. Getting off campus was such a badge of honor, even the quarterback on the football team couldn’t do that. So, that was really terrific,” said Ullman.\nUllman was first motivated to speak out about his story after his parents shared their story with him and his brother.\n“[My story] really started coming about when my parents celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary… at that point, my mother wrote her story and that was cathartic for my parents… from that point on, it was a matter of interest to me, and at a given moment I felt I had to write a book about all this because otherwise it would be totally lost, and my kids wouldn’t know about it, my grandkids wouldn’t, my nephews, nieces; nobody would know the story. So I felt it was important to write it, and I feel good about doing that,” said Ullman.\nUpon graduating Andover in 1957, Ullman attended Harvard College and Columbia University. He went on to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps and become the Founder and C.EO. of Cedar Shopping Centers (now Cedar Realty Trust), a real estate investment company.\n\n', 'Jan 29, 2016'), ('\nMarvin Minsky ’45, Ph.D., a preeminent scientist in the field of artificial intelligence, robotics, cognitive psychology and mathematics, passed away at the age of 88 on January 24 in Boston. The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage. In November, Minsky was awarded the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction, and spoke at an All-School Meeting (ASM).\nMinsky, whose work has contributed to the creation of the personal computer and the Internet, laid the foundation for the study of artificial intelligence. Seeing no great difference between the thinking processes of humans and those of machines, Minsky worked to characterize human psychological processes into computational ideas that would give computers intelligence, according to an article in “The New York Times.”\nMinsky came to Andover his Senior year and upon graduation, he served in the U.S. Navy for a few months before returning to study at Harvard College. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics from Harvard and his doctorate from Princeton University. Minsky later continued his journey in education as a professor at Massachusetts Institution of Technology (MIT).\n“He was a great guy in his work. I knew him as a classmate. Me and a lot of my friends had a lot of things that we did at school that wasn’t anything in his league, we were mostly involved in sports. I did grow up with him and everyone respected him because he was fearsome and he was a hard worker,” said Artie Moher ’45, Minsky’s Andover classmate, in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\nMinsky built the first neural network simulator, the Stochastic Neural-Analog Reinforcement Computer, in 1951. Just five years later, he created the first ever Confocal Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument known for its advanced image quality and resolution. In 1959, Minsky co-founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project, later called the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, with Professor John McCarthy.\nHis contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics and cognitive psychology earned him a number of prestigious distinctions, among them the ACM Turing Award, IJCAI Award for Research Excellence, Japan Prize, Benjamin Franklin Medal and the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction.\nIntroducing Minsky at the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction ceremony during ASM on November 4, Camille Little ’16 said, “Although he’s won countless awards, last night during the distinguished alumni dinner, when given the opportunity to talk about his achievements, he spent most of the night answering the audience’s questions. Above all, Dr. Minsky values teaching and sharing his knowledge. Perhaps his most important advice last night was to remind us the significance of curiosity in remaining a lifelong learner.”\nThat day was Minsky’s final and most recent visit to Andover.\n“Somehow in my career I was dropped into the right place at the right time. I was at Andover. I’d always been grateful to have experienced inspiration from teachers and facilities,” said Minsky during the November ASM.\nJohn Thorndike ’45, a fellow classmate, returned to hear Minsky receive the award despite never having had much contact with his peer during their time at Andover.\n“Well you know what his first sentence was [at the ASM]? It was something to the effect of: ‘There’s a lot of luck involved in life.’ And I was very surprised that a mathematical scientist, something that I am not, would make such a statement because certainly in my life, luck has been a big factor but I wouldn’t [have] thought it would’ve much in his life. That amazed me,” said Thorndike.\nMarvin Lee Minsky was born on August 9, 1927, to Dr. Henry Minsky and Fannie Reiser in New York City.

The results were released Thursday in an email from Head of School John Palfrey to the faculty, staff and administrators.\nThe 4×5 model will be instituted in Fall 2017, and will be subjected to further alterations by the new implementation committee, which will consist of six faculty members.\n“The faculty has chosen between two very sound alternatives: a schedule and calendar that has been serving us well and the new 4×5 design. It is now our job, as a community, to focus on how to implement this new design well,” wrote Palfrey in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe Schedule and Calendar Implementation Working Group, created as a part of the 2014 Strategic Plan, was tasked with creating a schedule and calendar that sustained the intellectual lives of students in a way that simultaneously supported their physical and emotional health. Four models were presented to the faculty for a vote in December.\n“I expect that work will be both challenging and exciting.  From my perspective, the primary benefits of the new design will come as a result of an ongoing deep examination of teaching and learning and how we can continue to improve both at Andover,” said Palfrey.\nStudent input was solicited throughout the process, during the initial drafting of the Strategic Plan, in a School Congress, during focus group discussions and most recently in open houses in Paresky Commons.\nUp until the last day of voting for the two schedule and calendar options and the release of the final decision, the faculty remained largely divided between the current schedule and the 4×5 model. The final round of voting was open from Monday to Wednesday.\n“[This voting process] probably [was] the most divisive [thing] that I [have] seen since I have been here, which is bizarre. People who don’t like the 4×5 really don’t like the 4×5; the people who don’t like the current, really don’t like the current,” said Shawn Fulford, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science.\nWill Orben, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, believes that the 4×5 schedule will offer students more free time.\n“I like the change in the use of our daily schedule with the 4×5, as opposed to the current schedule, where we’d have not a lot of time in the day to do other things. I like the possibility that we can use time during the day a little differently than we do right now… I think overall, I’m excited to try something different,” said Orben.\nLeon Holley, Instructor and Chair in Biology, thinks that the 4×5 schedule’s class periods could be too long for younger students.\nHolley said, “I’m concerned about the length of classes for our younger students, I’m not sure that the longer blocks and the way that the year is split up is in their best interest… I would rather stick with what we have, and see if we can tweak that.”\nThough opinions varied among faculty members, many feel that they were being pushed towards the 4×5 schedule.\nBoth Holley and Nicholas Kip ’60, Instructor in Classics, believe that some in the administration were biased toward a change in schedule, rather than an adjustment to the current model.\n“I don’t know exactly who the people are, but I think there are some people within the administration who want this to happen, even though they don’t teach… [They want] something new,” continued Kip, referencing a time when a proposed schedule was deemed not discussable.\nHolley added, “In my opinion, there’s always been a bias toward a new schedule… This would be unpopular to say, and it’s also my opinion only – I think that they were tasked with creating a new schedule, and not to modify the current one.”\nDespite the conflict that occurred before the 4×5 was voted on, Fulford is confident that the decision will best benefit the Andover community.\n“I think the big picture is that there is a lot that the faculty do agree on. We do agree that students are too stressed, we absolutely see that. We see that students are tired… We want students to have a chance to see students, to have fun, to eat and to sleep and all those kind of things… Where we disagree is how to arrange those pieces,” said Fulford.\n\n', 'Jan 29, 2016'), ('\nLeafing through articles that depicted the public education system in impoverished areas, Cassandra Tognoni ’05, then in her Upper year at Andover, expressed outrage at the lack of opportunities available to students attending public schools in these regions. Tognoni said she felt the immediate urge to find the solution towards improving the quality of the public education system.\nFeatured on this year’s Forbes’s “30 Under 30” list, Tognoni was recognized for her company BookReport. BookReport creates financial analysis and reports for school districts so they can better allocate their resources. Prior to co-founding BookReport, Tognoni graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, worked at Goldman Sachs in healthcare banking, taught at KIPP public charter schools and founded a charter school in Austin, Tex.\n“I think that I have always been obsessed with improving public education, and I think at any given moment I sort of just look around and say, ‘What can I have the biggest impact doing?’ ” said Tognoni in an interview with The Phillipian.\nStill in the early stages of BookReport’s development, Tognoni does not have an established daily routine. Rather, her days range from answering emails to researching potential investment partners and mapping out software products.\n“Our goal is really to change the national conversation about education and education spending,” she said. “Right now, when we talk about education, because we don’t have great data [on education], we either talk about [only] the education side or the spending side.”\nTognoni said she is currently focused on fundraising and developing software products to be piloted in more charter schools.\n“We don’t have those conversations really at all in education, and that is what we are trying to empower districts themselves,” said Tognoni.\n“We are also trying to empower the public to understand where [tax] dollars are going,” she continued.\nThough flattered by her “30 Under 30” selection, Tognoni said she seeks to create impact with her work, rather than notoriety.\n“In my personal life, I’m very weary about trying to make sure that what I’m pursuing is impact over anything else. Getting named a Forbes’s ‘30 Under 30’ is great, and it’s actually going to help with my fundraising, but it doesn’t really mean anything. I don’t want to be ungracious about it, but I think congratulations are [only] in store when you achieve something, and when you impact something,” said Tognoni.\nCurrently residing in Austin, TX., Tognoni grew up in Andover, Mass., and attended Andover as a day student. Tognoni credits Andover to helping her foster a passion for writing.\n“Before I got to Andover, I was a great student, but I thought I was a pretty mediocre writer… It was at Andover that I really cultivated the ability to write and also the love of writing. It’s really the way that I process everything now. After I read books, I write about them,” said Tognoni. Tognoni worked as the Commentary Editor for The Phillipian, vol. CXXVII, served as the Co-Captain of Andover Girls Volleyball and a high jumper for Andover Girls Track & Field.\nNina Scott, Instructor in English, worked closely with Tognoni at Andover as her advisor and English teacher. “We worked together the way all students do with their teachers… We sat down and talked about her work. We were very involved in talking about how she felt about the work, what inspired her, what was frustrating her and how to blast through all of that. And how to achieve all that she could as a thinker and a writer,” said Scott in an interview with The Phillipian.\nTognoni said she finds solace from her busy days through taking time to read. She urges current Andover students to read more and use technology less.\n“I was so happy we didn’t have smartphones at Andover because we played whiffle ball, and we were just doing all these things all the time… We barely used email. I think Andover is such a precious time. I look back on it so fondly, our Class of ’05. We’re all obsessed with each other, and we’re all super weird and love each other, and it scares me to think what social media would’ve done to that realness of our class,” said Tognoni.\nTognoni also advised current Andover students to not blindly follow their passions.\n“Pursue impact, pursue skill, which means you have to get good at something,” said Tognoni.\n“Everything that I’ve done… has built to exactly what I’m doing now. I didn’t really start off saying I wanted to start a financial software system for student districts. Not at all.

[Consequently] some forms of music no longer [are considered engaging] because they can’t keep up with what our brains expect from our surroundings,” said Wu during the presentation.\n“Music is a language: it’s an art form, it’s very expressive, it’s very creative and it’s wonderful… but it’s also a language… Teaching [how to listen to] music is actually very hard, because it’s this very complex, multi-layered form of language that we can only hear, and [it also uses] syntax and grammar that [most people don’t have] much training in,” he said.\nWu began his project a year and a half ago, inspired by Stephen Malinowski, an American musician and inventor who uploads his work to his YouTube channel.\n“Stephen Malinowski is actually the inventor of this approach. He’s an amazingly brilliant person and creator. He has a YouTube channel with similar animations that has over 140 million views,” said Wu during his presentation.\nMotivated by Malinowski, Wu recently decided to further Bebop by collaborating with the Swiss organization, Music:Eyes, which similarly allows the listener to visually understand the patterns in music.\nAt Andover, Christina Landolt, Instructor and Chair in Music, utilizes Bebop in her Music-225 classes to facilitate the progress of her students and help them better understand music and the topics covered in the course.\nLandolt said, “As a musician, when I look at [Bebop,] I… go ‘[Of course] that’s what it looks like!’ But when students who aren’t that familiar with note reading or even with classical music watch it, they have this light bulb moment where they see it and they totally get [it]…. So it’s just a really neat tool to get them farther along much more quickly.”\nLandolt said that she and Wu met over the summer to collaborate on the database together. This term, they have also continued working with it to better implement it in Andover’s music classrooms as well.\n“[Bebop is] still in its prototype form right now, so we’re still developing [the database] to help create something that is really useful in our classroom,” said Landolt.\nOne of the primary goals of Bebop and Music:Eyes is to integrate the platform into as many schools as possible, according to Wu. Beginning in the United States and countries in Europe, Wu will utilize his program to provide musical opportunities for kids who cannot afford music lessons.\nEmelie Eldracher ’18, an attendee of the presentation, said, “Hopefully in the future, there’s [a way of] teaching students who don’t necessarily understand… music… The aspect of [deciding] what shapes [and colors] you wanted is something that I really want to look into, because you can make the song match what you think the mood is. I think that could help if I was taking a music course to really think about the music.”\nWu also hopes that the database can help foster interest and passion in classical music.\nPaige Busse ’19, an attendee of the presentation, said, “What particularly intrigued me was how [Bebop] could be an interactive interface for the user, how the user could use it to interpret the music and find what they wanted… It wasn’t just a way of teaching, but [also] a way of interacting.”\nWu was contacted by the Music Department through the son of Jacques Hugon ’79, a Senior Technology Partner for the Tang Institute.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2016'), ('\nA new six-week Hatha and Vinyasa yoga course for faculty and staff started on Tuesday in the Sykes Wellness Center. The course is led by Sarah Shea, an instructor from Power Yoga Evolution in North Andover. The program is a new endeavor to be brought to Andover, though not the first fitness class to be brought to Andover for the faculty.\n“The classes will be taught in a Hatha and Vinyasa style yoga and are intended to be accessible to all levels of yoga experiences, from those who are just taking the plastic wrap off their first ever yoga mat to those who may have several years of experience,” said Shea.\nHatha yoga is slow-paced and involves basic moves to prepare the body for meditation. Vinyasa style yoga incorporates breath-synchronized movements and is generally more strenuous.\nThe course was made possible by members of Andover’s Employee Wellness Committee, specifically through the work of Nancy Lopez, Intranet Design Developer.\n“As part of the Employee Wellness Committee, I took on the responsibility of finding some physical fitness opportunities that would be at a time that is convenient to most adult community members,” said Lopez. “We have offered a boot camp option in the past and I thought that yoga would be a nice contrast and possibly attract a new crowd of participants.”\nThe course aims to help participants not only improve in yoga but also reap its benefits, which include help in recovery from injuries, greater strength and fitness, increase in flexibility and stress relief. This yoga course will also incorporate themes of mindfulness.\n“The yoga classes will include instruction on foundational poses, learning about alignment, getting in and out of poses safely and will include emphasis on utilizing breath work in the physical practice,” she continued.\nOver the six weeks, each session will build off what was taught in the previous week.

For more advanced yogis, my hope is they will deepen their physical practice by tuning into refined alignment points in each pose. For people working with injuries, I hope they will learn more about all the many ways yoga can be modified to support injury recovery,” says Shea. “Overall, I hope everyone leaves feeling supported, stronger, more flexible and less stressed.”\nThe six-week course meets every Tuesday from 5:30 to 6:45 p.m.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2016'), ('\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, notified students of a ban on hoverboards, self-balancing scooters and motorized skateboards, in an email sent to the Andover community on Wednesday.\n“We have received tragic reports from peer schools and universities, and we are unwilling to risk having these types of accidents and injuries at Andover,” wrote Elliott in the email.\nAccording to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety, hoverboards are prone to catching on fire.\n“It sounds like the fire-safety of the actual battery is the problem. Then we started looking at what our peer schools are doing too in terms of hoverboard policies. [St. Paul’s] sent something out about banning them… [Phillips Exeter Academy] banned them, and [Brooks] too. So basically hearing about them combusting or exploding, that’s basically the biggest issue,” said Elliott.\nElliott observed that hoverboards have not been as popular at Andover as she initially expected.\n“[The email] was reactive to what we’ve seen on campus, and more proactive thinking about what’s happening on other campuses. In some ways, I’m actually surprised that more kids didn’t come back with hoverboards,” said Elliott.\nElliott does not know if riding a hoverboard would be dangerous enough to be another cause of concern.\n“I don’t think we know enough at this point to know their safety. I think that’s it. So given that this seems to be the policies of a number of campuses, at both universities and schools, it felt like the right thing to do for this interim stretch, if safety can be assured as to whatever extent,” said Elliott.\nAccording to the “Blue Book,” “Boarding students are not permitted to have or to operate any motorized vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, mopeds or motorized scooters, while they are at school.”\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2016'), ('\nOn Monday evening, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day activities culminated in Kemper Auditorium with a Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar presentation by Alexis Lefft ’16, titled “The Predominantly White Institution and Its Role in the Identity Formation of African-American Students.”\nAfter giving a tour to a prospective African-American student and family one day, Lefft, who is the Barbara Landis Chase CAMD Scholar, realized that she had omitted much of the unpleasantness of her experiences as an African-American student. Lefft ended the tour wanting to further analyze the reality of being a racial minority at predominantly and historically white institutions. “When these prospective students asked me what it’s like to be a black student here, whether implicitly or explicitly, I managed to conveniently avoid the question… because I knew what types of rhetoric were associated with black students who suggested that their experiences at predominantly white institutions were a little less than what an admissions brochure might suggest,” said Lefft during her presentation.\n“The predominantly white campus continues to be fraught with markers of racial inclusion and exclusion, which often go unnoticed by members of the dominant culture and sometimes by black students themselves. This hidden dimension of racialized violation is all the more insidious precisely because we do not recognize it as such,” said Lefft.\nLefft drew from her own experiences while working on the project. She credits her past experiences before and during her time at Andover as the reason she sought this opportunity as a CAMD Scholar.\n“Where I came from in South Carolina, it was mostly middle-income, conservative white people. When I got here, I thought this experience would be similar or at least wouldn’t be drastically different because, again, I’d already gone to predominantly white schools. But really, it was more like I felt affected by whiteness in a different way here, at a school with so much history and especially with people with more money,” said Lefft in an interview with The Phillipian.\nTo help audience members get a better idea of African-American students’ experiences, Lefft’s presentation concluded with a panel of four African-American students: Avery Jonas ’16, Dakoury Godo-Solo ’17, Madison Pettaway ’17 and Justice Robinson ’18. These students were given the opportunity to speak on their experiences both before and during their time at Andover, as well as to answer questions from audience members.\n“I talked about being a day student. I was the only black day student on the panel. We’re kind of a rare breed. We live in a somewhat awkward position, because people will be like ‘Are you from New York?’ and I’ll be like, ‘Actually I live here. I’ve lived here my whole life,’ ” said Godo-Solo. “It’s always an interesting conundrum because it’s like, what does blackness mean when you grew up in a community of white people, around white people [and] went to school with white people?”\nLefft chose Onaje Woodbine, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies, as her faculty advisor for the project. Woodbine and Lefft worked closely, keeping in contact throughout the summer to put together her research paper and presentation.\nIn an email sent to The Phillipian, Woodbine wrote, “My favorite part of the project was getting to know Alexis, the human being. There is no greater gift for a teacher than to be taught by one of his or her students. Alexis certainly has taught me a great deal.”\nLefft was glad she was able to reflect on her experiences as an African-American student at Andover and that she could share the stories of other African-American students and how their experiences intersect with different facets of their identities.\nLefft said, “I think my main message is that just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. If someone tells you they’re having a certain experience and you don’t believe that it’s true… you don’t necessarily have the grounds to say that unless you’ve been in that place yourself.”\nPettaway said, “I think the topic itself should be highlighted even more on this campus and other oppressed identities need to be talked about. I really enjoyed that Alexis talked about something she experienced during her four years and something that she found worthwhile.” Editor’s Note: Avery Jonas ’16 is a Managing Editor for The Phillipian vol.

Mock, author of the book “Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More” and host of the MSNBC show “So POPular!”, spoke about her experiences as a transgender woman of color and why she decided to share her story with the world through her book.\n“I thought, possibly, that me opening up in this way could touch some people… It just felt right. Telling my story was my first step towards living my truth – living it by sharing it,” said Mock during ASM.\nKarissa Kang ’17 and Madison Pettaway ’17 introduced Mock, praising the work she has done in advocating for the rights of trans people and people of color.\n“I think it was really important for [Mock] to come [to campus] just so that she can offer [her] perspective to us, and really highlight a group of people who don’t really get their chance to shine, especially at an institution as [cisgender] as this,” said Pettaway.\nIn her introduction of Mock during ASM, Kang said, “Before I read ‘Redefining Realness,’ I’d never read anything written about trans people that wasn’t either sensationalist or disdainfully clinical, much less written by an actual trans person… It also reminded me that trans people all have incredibly different experiences… I took something away from it, and so can everyone.”\nMembers of the Office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) said they chose Mock as the keynote speaker because of her vast knowledge of gender and race, as well as her experience talking about the intersections of identity. LaShawn Springer, Director of Community and Multicultural Development, said she was initially unsure of how the Andover community would react to CAMD’s choice.\n“We’re all in a space of learning and growth. But that’s the beginning of the conversation. So to have Mock expose us to a more complicated and complex story, honestly I wasn’t sure how people would react… I thought it was important to talk about King’s legacy and the way I see it intertwined with current social movements,” said Springer.\n“If you pay attention to the language used to discredit the work being done by advocates like Mock, it’s eerily similar to the language used to discredit the Civil Rights Movement,” she continued.\nSpringer hosted a moderated discussion with Mock during ASM, an idea suggested by Mock to allow for a more personal and informal interaction with the audience. Springer asked Mock to take students through the journey of her decision to be honest with her own transgender story, and to talk about what empathy means in her work as a writer and advocate for trans people’s rights.\nIn her conversation with Springer, Mock expressed her frustration with the slow progress of achieving rights for transgender people. “What’s difficult for me is that [trans people are] still fighting… for something so basic as, ‘What are you going to call me?’, ‘Will you please respect me and call me by my name and my pronouns?’ That’s the level that we’re at… How are we supposed to get protections for [trans] folks when we still don’t respect them as they come?” said Mock in the ASM.\nMock also emphasized the importance of empathy in creating a more understanding community. She acknowledged the difficulty of opening one’s mind to new ideas, especially in a space of excellence like Andover.\n“You do not know everything. None of us do,” said Mock. “And I think that a lot of that comes from that sense of arrogance that’s built. A lot of times, when you’re in these spaces of excellence, that’s your way that you survive. You pretend that you know everything, and you might catch up later on, but when you’re in a space and a person is trying to bring you along and catch you up, you should appreciate that.”\nHead of School John Palfrey agreed with Mock’s sentiments of recognizing arrogance and urged students to reflect further upon this concept as he closed ASM.\n“One of the most important things I’ve heard from [Mock] this morning is to admit that you don’t know something. I will admit that this is a topic we’ve been talking about in which I don’t have a great deal of knowledge or experience… I think that those are the most important learning moments. The moments in which we are, in fact, uncomfortable, but we let our mind open,” said Palfrey.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2016'), ('\nRelishing the taste of savory Thai food and freshly baked cookies, the members of MOSAIC launched Mixed-Heritage Awareness Week with a discussion in the Office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) last Sunday exploring how colleges perceive mixed-heritage students.\nMOSAIC, an affinity group at Andover for individuals who identify as mixed-heritage, biracial, multicultural or multiethnic, functions primarily as a safe space where students can discuss and share experiences relating to their identity.\nTo recognize the value of cultures around the world and celebrate students of mixed heritage, Aya Murata, Faculty Advisor to MOSAIC and Coordinator of the CAMD Scholar Program, campaigned to establish the MOSAIC affinity group at Andover in the early 2000s. While Murata is on sabbatical for the Winter Term, MOSAIC is being led by Maggie Farnsworth, Associate Director of College Counseling.\nStriving to welcome mixed-heritage students into the multicultural community and connect them with others who share similar backgrounds, MOSAIC was founded to accommodate the growing number of students who identify as mixed-heritage at Andover. According to The Phillipian’s “State of the Academy” in 2015,  nine percent of students identify as mixed-heritage, whereas eight-and-a-half percent identified as mixed-heritage in 2014.\nThe title of the club, MOSAIC, serves as a reminder to mixed-heritage students that the various aspects of their identities are combined to form a whole individual, just as a mosaic consists of multiple pieces to form a design.\n“All of us are mixed-heritage, and obviously a mosaic is a bunch of pieces that go together in the same way that we have different parts of identity that go together to form ourselves,” said  Rosie Poku ’17, a board member of MOSAIC.\nSamir Safwan ’16, Co-Head of MOSAIC, wrote in an email to The Phillipian,  “Because MOSAIC is an affinity group, only students who self-identify as mixed-heritage can attend. By having a group of students who all come from a mixed-heritage background, MOSAIC allows for us to connect with each other on a more personal level because many of us share similar experiences.”\nUpon joining MOSAIC, Julia Beckwith ’17, a board member of the group, said she gained newfound clarity about her identity as half-Korean and half-American. The club helped her feel more comfortable with being biracial and  helped her explore what this identity means to her.\nBeckwith said, “I joined MOSAIC as a [Junior], and I didn’t really know what I was getting into. It was just really cool, because I never really had a space to talk about these issues with other people that understood me and understood the struggle of not really fitting into a box and not really being sure of what to check off and being awkward at family reunions.”\nWhile MOSAIC emphasizes embracing all parts of a person’s identity, focus is also placed on avoiding generalizations about different cultural groups. Rather, members strive to embrace and appreciate each part of themselves so as not to be limited into one category.\nPoku said, “I think MOSAIC, as a group, is… a great support group for students of mixed heritage and that’s a great first step. Also, I think taking the time to talk to people about their identities and really listen to them is another awesome thing to do. Just trying to avoid generalizing people into one box, or one aspect of identity and allow that to overcome all other aspects of identity, and allow them to be multifaceted.”\n“Growing up, I’d always solely identified as black,” said board member Madison Pettaway ’17. “Sometimes I still do say I’m a strong black woman just because it is the aspect of my identity that I’ve been most comfortable with. I’ve always been forced to choose one side, and so MOSAIC gave me the opportunity to embrace both sides and really be true to who I am and explore my racial identity in ways that I never did.”\nIn addition to promoting conversation about multiculturalism, MOSAIC club members are also responsible for coordinating and hosting events during Mixed-Heritage Awareness Week at Andover. The goal of the week is to better inform the general student population about mixed-heritage students and their experiences as people of mixed race.\n“Within ourselves, we call it Appreciation [Week]. This week is very much just trying to get the greater community involved and get them knowing more about our side of the story because so often do we get lumped with bigger groups like Asian Society or African-Latino American. This week we want to celebrate our multiple identities instead of always having to choose one,” said Pettaway.\nBoard member Ian Jackson ’16 said, “We talked a lot about being of mixed heritage background in regards to the college process and how that affects it, and we actually got a lot of information because [Farnsworth] is a college counselor, and she worked for Wellesley [College] admissions, so she’s really familiar with that. Students asked a lot of questions about race, and if you’re biracial, some colleges take into account only one race, but some colleges have a separate section for biracial and multiracial kids. So we asked a lot of questions about that.”\nIn addition to the discussion regarding mixed-heritage and college last Sunday, MOSAIC also arranged a mixed-heritage display on the ground floor of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, featuring pictures of every MOSAIC club member. Club members hope this display will help educate the student body about the experiences of mixed-heritage students at Andover.\nFarnsworth said, “It’s especially helpful for current students to walk through the library and see the display on the wall, because you’ll see some [about] the members of MOSAIC and also just their feelings about what it means to come from different backgrounds.”\nOutside of Mixed-Heritage Awareness Week, MOSAIC meets once per month to discuss multiculturalism topics, such as the first time students realized the duality of their heritage and the portrayal of mixed people in the media.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nWelcomed into the Nest by a room full of applauding students, Head of School John Palfrey was honored for his contribution to the field of library science. His latest book, “BiblioTech: Why Libraries Matter More Than Ever in the Age of Google,” served as the basis for a design challenge and conversation regarding the digital future of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) last Friday evening.\nPalfrey’s book argues that anyone seeking to fully participate in the age of technology has to understand how to not only find, but also utilize the vast stores of information available online. The book also explores how libraries must make the transition to a digital future in order to survive our modernizing world.\nMike Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services, said he thinks it is important for students to be able to find online resources, use online databases and check the reliability of a source.\n“I think research is one of the most important skills students can come away from here with. It cuts across all disciplines and classes. Later on in life, they’ll learn that research is an amazing tool to just adapt to different jobs and tasks that will help you collaborate with all kinds of different people,” said Barker.\nStudents in attendance broke up into small discussion groups guided by librarians. Some of the groups were asked to consider the merits of real versus electronic books, while other groups looked into potential improvements on the physical design of the library.\nSeveral ideas came up, including alterations to the library space, the addition of more lighting and the institution of a research mentor system to assist students. Many of the ideas centered around shifting the library’s focus towards the digital realm.\n“I think that people really value the library, but it would be a better space if we could work to make it fit our needs better as a community,” said Annika Sparrell ’18, an attendee at the event.\nOther students applauded the library’s initiative to further diversify its resources and provide a wider range of functionality to students.\n“Our library is not just for books. People come here to work on group projects. [Barker] gave us an entire room [above the second floor of the library] just for robotics… It’s really nice to have a building where you can come and just do what you want to do — even things like robotics,” said Jocelyn Shen ’18, an attendee. Her club, which participates in the international VEX Robotics competition, was given space in the library to work.\n “[The library] is a space to talk about different things that may not have to do with work or academics. [The use of this space is] still a way of learning, just different,” said Rahmel Dixon ’17.\nBarker hopes that increased student input will help guide the library’s transformation over the coming years and encourages them to reach out with feedback or suggestions.\n“For me, personally, this was an awesome opportunity to hear what students think about the OWHL now, and what they want in the future because we want to co-develop this future [with student input and feedback],” said Barker.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nDear Sam, a student-run initiative founded to provide Andover students with accessible resources and information about wellness, published its magazine “Feeling Blue” this past week. By having students on the staff of the organization answer anonymous questions submitted by their classmates, Dear Sam members hope to offer peer-to-peer education regarding mental, physical and emotional wellness on campus.\nThe organization was created last year in midst of conversations surrounding physical and mental health on campus.\n“Last year, there was a lot of discussion centered around topics such as physical health, eating disorders, mental health, depression – that kind of stuff. It really hit us seeing how our peers were being affected by these types of issues, so we really wanted to think of a solution that could unite students to fight these issues together,” said Andrew Cortner ’17, Co-Editor in Chief of Dear Sam.\nTo get advice before starting the initiative, Cortner and Niko Skrivanos ’17, Co-Editor in Chief, spoke with Patricia Russell, Dean of Studies; Paul Murphy ’83, former Dean of Students; Carol Israel, Director of Counseling and Co-Director of Wellness Education, and Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-Director of Wellness Education. Israel and Patel both serve as Dear Sam’s Faculty Advisors.\n“We had to be very persistent and willing to overcome lots of different obstacles that kept coming our way… We had a lot of meetings with [Israel] and [Patel], working through these types of issues, but now, a year in, we finally have finished our website and published our first book and magazine, got an Abbot Grant and done lots of things that I don’t think we would have thought we could have done at the time,” said Skrivanos.\nAt dearsam.org, students may access an online library of questions already answered by the Dear Sam team, or submit their own to be answered by the staff, a team of fellow students. The content on the website, as well as the book and magazine, are carefully reviewed by Israel and Patel.\nThe initiative encompasses many of the goals of the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center, most importantly that of promoting health and wellness in the Andover community.\n“I initially thought that their plans were too grand, that their ideas were way too big for what they wanted to do… Those feelings have changed tremendously, as they have proven, time and time again, that they have the energy and the motivation to really do this,” said Israel.\nPatel said, “No one knows a student like another student… and they continuously impressed me with their execution of this initiative, so I’ve been excited about this since the very beginning. [Israel] and I gave them a couple avenues to explore to refine their idea, and they have taken those and run with them.”\nDear Sam covers six main topics of conversation: physical health, mental health, academic issues, relationship issues, sexual health and diversity. While the organization is not replacing resources offered by the Wellness Center, it aims to provide information for students who might be afraid of being stigmatized for seeking help.\n“For Dear Sam, we wanted students to have resources accessible to them, and to be able to get an answer to a question that they wouldn’t be able to get anywhere else. Because it’s an online platform, we want students to be able to reach out anonymously, so they’re not stigmatized for having to go to the Wellness Center. They can keep to themselves, but still get the help they need,” said Skrivanos.\nMeg Davis ’17, a Physical Health Editor, said, “I think it makes it easier for people to get access to information about certain things. It’s less pressure than having to go to talk to a counselor about something, because it’s anonymous. They can also answer questions that other people may have, and not know they have.”\nDear Sam’s by-students-for-students design allows the organization to bring together many student voices and opinions, translating them into useful discussion about issues unique to Andover.\n“Everyone has a unique perspective, and Dear Sam is just a collection of student voices. The more people who want to get involved, the more reliable Dear Sam [will be] as a resource, because we [will] have a larger representation of the student body, which I think is a really important aspect of what Dear Sam is,” said Cortner.\nDear Sam will be hosting an official launch party for “Feeling Blue” this Friday in the Wellness Center.\nMax Vale ’18, a reader, said, “We know that there are always going to be people who aren’t feeling their best here on campus, and having publications that can reach out to them and tell them how to get help is really great… I think it’s just super important to know that there are always students who are going to be looking out for other students.”\nEditor’s Note: Niko Skrivanos is an Associate Layout Editor for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nEvery Monday night, a group of about 50 students trickle into Susie’s to write letters for American soldiers stationed overseas.\n“[In Adopt-a-Platoon,] we write letters to servicemen and women serving overseas… I try to emphasize to people that the purpose is to keep it serious but also to brighten someone’s day,” said Julia Boyd ’16, a Student Coordinator of Adopt-a-Platoon.\nAfter receiving an assignment of a specific platoon from the national organization “Adopt-a-Platoon” at the beginning of the school year, the club sends weekly letters to the soldiers, building a rapport between the club and their assigned platoon. This year, members have been sending letters to a platoon of soldiers stationed in Kuwait.\n“It’s kind of a nice time to take from your homework load to just reflect on things you’re grateful for,” said Emma Timken ’18, a participant in Adopt-a-Platoon. “It really puts things into perspective because you’re writing to these people who are fighting for our country and really putting their lives on the line.”\nStarting each letter with “Dear Soldier,” students are free to write about a variety of topics, ranging from recent sports games to favorite movies. Each week, there is a theme that students are encouraged to write about in their letters.\nWhile careful to avoid including their private information in their letters, students said they often go into detail about their everyday lives as American high schoolers, hoping to paint a vivid image of their homes for the soldiers abroad.\nStudents often decorate their letters with colorful drawings and designs, making their letters more exciting and engaging.\n“We usually have colorful markers and paper, so I encourage people to use lots of different colors and decorate the papers… Our themes can be favorite movies, what’s going on [during their days or] favorite thing about winter,” said Boyd.\nIn the past, the club has sent care packages packed with Twizzlers, shaving cream, razors, soap, lotion, beef jerky and objects that may otherwise be inaccessible in the country in which their platoon is stationed.\nParticipants gain a deeper connection with the soldiers and, as the year progresses, writing to them becomes akin to sending messages to long-lost relatives, said Boyd. She described how impressed she was with the responsibility that members have assumed in order to ensure the continued relationship with the soldiers.\n“We had such good attendance last term. A lot of [the participants] will always come regularly and, if they can’t, I’ll always be getting emails [asking if they could] actually make it up even in their spare time, even outside of the official Adopt-a-Platoon time,” said Boyd.\nParticipants expressed that taking the effort to write the each letters each week is worth it—despite the fact that they don’t expect any response—as the letters have the potential to make a huge difference to a soldier’s day.\n“You don’t realize how much one letter can really impact a soldier’s day,” said Timken. “I know that they’re not going to respond, but I think at the same time, just knowing that they’ll read it and know that someone cares about them [is important].”\n“It’s hard to reach soldiers any other way… I think that sending letters and sending care packages is helpful and will boost their morale… It makes a difference for each soldier that does get a letter,” said BrianPaul Robert ’16, a four-year member of the program.\nTwo years ago, however, the soldiers surprised the students by writing a thank-you note to each one of them.\n“Because we don’t ever get to meet these people [and] we don’t usually hear from them, [having this] confirmation that they [have been] receiving [our letters] was really special to me,” said Boyd.\nA fresh group of 29 volunteers joined the club on Monday.

Hollis described her journey from being an Andover student to a Fulbright Scholar during her presentation in the office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) last Wednesday.\nDuring her presentation, Hollis described how her early challenges at Andover continued to motivate her in the future to prevent her failures, her ‘no’ moments, from interfering with reaching her goals.\n“I [wanted to] talk about my experiences here at [Andover] and… the experiences that I had in undergrad, graduate school and how many [moments] of ‘no’ from different places for different reasons did not stop me from moving towards my [moment] now,” said Hollis during an interview with The Phillipian.\nHollis also discussed how overcoming her academic challenges at Andover helped her remain hopeful and optimistic in the face of failure. Although she did poorly in the first term of her Spanish class, she didn’t give up and eventually appeared on a local television program with John Maier, Instructor in Spanish, during a trip to Spain her Senior year, she said.\n“It really is about your drive, how much do you want it, how far are you going to push, and for me that lesson in language, the academic setting, was a precursor to my determination in other areas of my life,” said Hollis.\nAfter graduating cum laude from Andover, Hollis continued her studies at Columbia University and received a bachelor’s degree in creative writing. She also decided to challenge herself, taking on Mandarin as a new language.\n“I decided ironically that I like learning languages – Spanish was a little rough… but I was going to try something new and, by something new, that meant Mandarin Chinese… It [was] well worth the experience,” said Hollis.\nHollis soon found herself applying to numerous study-abroad programs in China. However, despite trying year after year, she did not get into any of the programs.\n“I graduated and enjoyed the experience, but I still had that big ‘no.’ It just did not happen for me that time,” said Hollis.\nInstead of giving up, Hollis continued to look for opportunities in China while attending graduate school at the University of Michigan of Education to receive a Master’s Degree in higher education.\nIn 2014, Hollis was accepted into the Fulbright Program, a grant given to individuals hoping to pursue a designed study or research project in a foreign country.\nHollis’s research focused on Chinese college students’ preparation, expectations and transition experiences in English-speaking countries. She interviewed numerous Chinese students heading to countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Towards the end of her scholarship, Hollis was able to give a motivational speech at the Beijing American Center to Chinese students who were planning to study abroad in countries such as the United States.\nHollis hopes her experience will inspire Andover students not to be discouraged by rejection.\nHollis’s presentation in CAMD encouraged Alejandro Diaz de Argandona ’16 to stay positive even when confronted with difficulties.\n“If we keep [the] mindset of Hollis, we can really transform our rejected opportunities into new opportunities… After all, I know it’s pretty hard [at Andover]. I will try after this meeting to tell myself maybe there is another open door,” said Argandona.\nThe presentation also inspired Sarah Langr ’18 to embrace the idea of a positive mindset.\n“At Andover, it has been a struggle—sometimes classes are difficult, you don’t get accepted into every program that you like getting into, but it’s not the end of the road. There are still ways you can go.

Nine years later, Olusola’s current group, Pentatonix, won a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental, or A Capella, for their mashup of Daft Punk songs. More recently, Pentatonix was featured in “Forbes”’s “30 Under 30” for their success in the music industry.\nAfter Andover, Olusola enrolled at Yale University.  During his time there, Olusola garnered significant attention online after posting a video of himself celloboxing, the art of simultaneously playing the cello and beatboxing, on YouTube. He was then approached by a group of vocalists and together they entered NBC’s “The Sing-Off,” an a cappella singing competition. The quintet of vocalists—which, with Olusola, became Pentatonix—went on to win the competition in 2011, and their album “That’s Christmas to Me” went Platinum on Christmas Eve in 2014, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.\nOlusola came to Andover in 2004 as a new Upper, transferring from the small town of Owensboro, KY. While he enjoyed being involved in the Music Department as a cellist and a beatboxer during his time at Andover, Olusola never considered a career in music. His mentor and role-model, William Thomas, a former Instructor in Music who retired in 2008 and passed away in 2013, encouraged him to follow his passions, whatever they may be.\n“[Thomas] just loved music as much as anybody could… He [told me], ‘Kevin, you’re different and I want you to be able to pursue life with all of your heart and soul – in whatever you want,’ ” said Olusola in a phone interview with The Phillipian.\nOlusola appeared on his first album, “XX/XY,” as a member of The Yorkies in 2005.\n“It was really interesting to put my beats behind their vocals and it was the first time I ever really recorded in a studio somewhat professionally. I didn’t know what to expect but I just knew it was so much fun and to have the support of my Andover brothers,” said Olusola.\nGetting the opportunity to meet and bond with other teenagers from all over the globe was an experience Olusola cherished from his Andover experience.\n“The thing that I loved about Andover was [being] able to be in an environment where it pushed me and challenged me. I could meet very progressive thinkers and to come from a small town environment which was very nurturing to this other nurturing environment but in a very different way that happens to teach you to be very independent and to stand on your own two feet and think for yourself – that was probably the biggest thing and hardest part of it,” said Olusola.\nOlusola cites the lessons he learned at Andover as the foundation for his success as a musician. Time management, a skill he learned out of necessity as a student, allowed him to thrive both inside and outside the classroom.\n“[Time management] was the most important thing that I probably learned, because I think I believe that I accomplished so much throughout my college career – in terms of music – only because I learned [it] so well at Andover,” said Olusola.\nOlusola also discovered his passion for languages while at Andover. The Spanish classes he took inspired him to travel to Puerto Rico for a trip abroad during the summer before his Senior year. Olusola’s fascination with languages continued to grow during his time at Yale.\nIn 2009, he decided to take a year off from school to study Chinese in Beijing, China. It was on this trip when his Chinese teacher suggested combining his passions for beatboxing and cello into a new music form.\n“I thought that [celloboxing] was something that people really wouldn’t accept. In the classical community, people would think that I was trying to tarnish classical music, but then I started thinking that something different could be interesting and let me just try it. You can’t judge something until you try it,”  said Olusola.\nAs an African-American male in the music industry, Olusola credited the Internet with helping him feel more comfortable performing classical music and his refusal to conform to stereotypes. In 2009, Olusola uploaded a rendition of “Julie-O,” a cello piece written by Mark Summer, which launched him into stardom in the a cappella community.\n“There’s another thing that I think I see in music is that stereotypically, people should be a certain way. If you’re an African American in music, you should be doing hip-hop or R&B or soul, but the great thing again about the Internet is that if you have a clear idea of how music can be, you can let that express yourself and you can also break stereotypes,” said Olusola.\nOlusola, along with his a cappella group Pentatonix, was included in the music section of “Forbes” annual “30 Under 30” list. This list features the top 30 innovators, creators and visionaries in 20 different areas. Five other Phillips Academy alumni were included on the list. The Phillipian will run a feature on each alum the following consecutive weeks.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nAfter screening his film, “The Story of Brian Gittens,” in a crowded restaurant in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday, Jack McGovern ’15 received a standing ovation from scores of Andover alumni and faculty members, including Brian Gittens ’89,\n“The Story of Brian Gittens” recounts the day Andover installed its first Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr. Day celebration. During his Senior year, Gittens spent MLK Jr. Day on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall and played a recording of Dr. King’s speech “I Have A Dream” on repeat, refusing to attend classes in hope of Andover finally recognizing the importance of this national holiday.\nLinda Carter Griffith, Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion, persuaded McGovern to screen the film in places beyond the Andover campus after he premiered it in Kemper Auditorium last year. Together, the pair selected Washington, D.C., as a screening site because of its proximity to the many Andover alumni and former faculty members who were involved in the film.\n“We had been kind of envisioning screening the film in D.C. maybe a year ago, ever since I premiered it a year ago at Andover, but we never got to a specific date until just several months ago, just because we were trying to find the right time. And we actually finally decided that a time near Martin Luther King Jr. Day would be appropriate and be most relevant to people watching the film,” said McGovern in an interview with The Phillipian.\nGittens said, “I think [the film is] reaching out to our alumni, especially to our minority alumni during this time of year. I think it’s a powerful reminder of the connection that the event has with the institution.”\nMcGovern also hosted a question-and-answer session after screening the film.\nGittens noted that this screening was a great opportunity for interpersonal connection among alumni and other Andover community members.\n“I think that events or critical instances like this connect people emotionally because you can forget facts, you can forget names and things like that over time, but often times emotions and things like that are powerful connections,” Gittens said. “I think this is just one of many opportunities to do that and Andover has a wonderful way to do that, helping to cultivate this affinity for the institution.”\nMcGovern said, “What happened when I made the film about Gittens is that I was able to, in some sense, immortalize his story and share it with generations of other Andover students. I think that’s a really powerful thing, and I really love being able to do that.”\nGittens has lofty hopes for McGovern’s film career, and is looking forward to see what McGovern can create next.\n“[‘The Story of Brian Gittens’] is pretty impressive, I think, in terms of capturing the moment and some of the emotions around it,” Gittens said. “I think if this is any indication, he’s off to a good start, a very promising start.”\nGittens’s reaction to the film was what McGovern had hoped for at the start of the project. When Gittens came back to Andover as the keynote speaker in the 2015 MLK Jr. Day All-School Meeting, he viewed the first screening of McGovern’s movie.\n“[Gittens] walked up on stage afterwards – I’m not sure if anyone prompted him to – but he walked up on stage and stood at the podium and just started tearing up. It was really powerful to me to know that I touched his feelings in that way and he was explaining to me and the audience how much this film meant to him and his family and really to his life and what he lives for,” said McGovern.\nOther alumni and former faculty members also attended the screening in Washington, D.C., including Bobby Edwards, former Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), and Darryl Cohen ’92. The event was hosted by the Abbot Academy Association.\nMcGovern will attend New York University Tisch School of the Arts next fall as a member of the Class of 2020. Although he is unsure of exactly what direction he will take, he hopes to pursue filmmaking.\n“I like to keep my options open. I love exploring different genres of film, too. But I definitely have a strong interest in documentary particularly because I like the realness of it, and the fact that there are stories in life that, when you share them in the medium of film, can become so much more powerful than they would be otherwise,” said McGovern.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nAfter three years of discussing how to better integrate sexual education into the Andover curriculum, the Biology Department and staff members from the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center have collaborated to incorporate sexual education classes into the Biology 100 and Biology 500 courses.\n“We’ve always had [sexual education], but it hasn’t been as aggressive,” said Leon Holley, Instructor and Chair in Biology. “[Previously,] it’s been through the health center or house counselors. As a part of every opening dorm meeting, there’s going to be some mention about parietals and what’s appropriate and not appropriate.”\nAndover currently offers education on healthy relationships through courses specific to underclassmen, such as Personal and Community Education (PACE) and Physical Education 200 (PE).\nBoth the Biology Department and the Wellness Center decided that yearlong biology courses would be the ideal platform for expanding Andover’s sexual education program.\n“I think that the Empathy & Balance curriculum, as part of the Strategic Plan, recognized that an obvious place for us to address sexual education here is through our biology courses because… it’s a way for us to pretty much [reach] most students who come through in a four-year or three-year stint,” said Holley.\nDr. Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-Director of Wellness Education, said, “The idea to teach sex ed, or portions of sexual health in biology, has been going on for years… We asked ourselves, What are some courses that we already teach that we might be able to tweak a little bit to bring in more sexual health education?”\nAndover’s first interdepartmental sex-ed collaboration between the Wellness Center and the Biology Department occurred last year when nurse practitioners visited a Biology 500 class to implement more sexual health education into the class’s curriculum.\n“A few of us – myself, [Jo-Ann] Fortier, [Sarah] Robinson – served as teaching assistants in a contraception lab and really detailed out specific contraceptive methods, talked about sexually transmitted infections and talked about resources on campus. This year, we are doing the same thing,” said Patel.\nRobinson, a Nurse Practitioner and Wellness Educator, said, “I taught one period with [Marc] Koolen, [Instructor in Biology,] and it was really fun. The students seemed to be really engaged and asked a lot of questions. This class was part of their reproductive health unit, and this is material that has always been covered in biology, but they did a lab on different contraceptive methods. I was a guest speaker, so the kids could ask more medical-type questions if they wanted to.”\nOver the past three years, Andover has been expanding its sexual health education, and incorporating sexual education into biology classes is one way in which the school hopes to continue to develop and enhance what is already offered.\nPatel said, “I think it’s crucial [that] we teach sexual education on campus… Our job is to give students the tools they need, the education [and] the knowledge to help them think through scenarios, their own ideals and values.”\nThus far, neither Patel nor Holley have received any negative feedback about the idea of incorporating sexual education into yearlong biology courses.\n“I haven’t heard any pushback, and I think it’s because people believe this is important, so just like we need to be teaching academic courses and teaching about drugs and alcohol and managing our emotions and relationships, sexual health is a part of that and actually intertwines with many other facets,” said Patel.\nOlivia Picchione ’16, a student in Biology 500, wrote in a message to The Phillipian, “I thought it was awesome. It made the topic of contraception less intimidating and daunting, and actually provoked a lot of conversation between students. I had never seen a [female] condom before, and had heard of other things but never knew how they worked. It just made contraception feel a lot more relatable and less creepy.”\nIn the future, Patel hopes to expand this enhanced collaboration with the Biology Department while also focusing on a separate four-year health education curriculum for all Andover students.\n“In a couple of years, we will hopefully have a four-year curriculum where we’re not just talking about sex and sexual health four or five or six times over the course of somebody’s four-year Andover experience, but rather we would talk about it every year and make it age-appropriate and more longitudinal of a conversation. That’s the vision. That’s the goal, and it’s coming—it’s being implemented as we speak,” said Patel.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nSteve Snyder ’56 P’83 has pledged $15 million toward the construction of a new athletic complex on the Andover campus. The facility aims to bring more athletics indoors, improve the athletic curriculum and enhance both Lifetime Instructional and Fitness Education (L.I.F.E.) sports and team experiences.\nThe donation was made to honor Snyder’s upcoming 60th Andover reunion this June. The construction of the 90,000 square-foot facility will begin this summer and is slotted to finish in December 2017.\n“The new complex will provide a new indoor 200-meter track, 12 new squash courts, multi-purpose rooms for classes or functions that look out onto the stadium, new locker facilities and many great breakout spaces. The infield of the track will have four indoor tennis courts that can also be used for basketball,” wrote Larry Muench, Director of Facilities in the Office of the Physical Plant, in an email to The Phillipian.\nSnyder’s pledge has covered nearly half of the slated goal of $34 million for the new complex. The project signals the commencement of Phase One of the Athletics Facilities Master Plan.\nDuring his time at Andover, Snyder was an eight-letter track star. His Junior year, Snyder won the New England Interscholastic 40-Yard Dash. He was then awarded the Sorota Track Trophy at his Commencement, an award given for  his “outstanding character and the will to win.”\n“We are so grateful that Steve’s Andover experience—his admiration for Coach Sorota and lifelong relationships with classmates and friends—continues to have profound meaning in his life,” said Head of School John Palfrey in an Andover press release. “The generosity of Steve and his family ensures that generations of students will continue to develop their own personal connections while experiencing the joys of competition, teamwork and camaraderie in a state-of-the-art facility.”\nIn the Andover press release, Snyder said, “I like to make connections for people. The athletic center will help to do that as well—serving track and many other sports and needs. It will be a wonderful example of the ways in which these types of facilities should be used today\xad—as a place for the community to gather.”\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2016'), ('\nAs he walked into one of the two new classrooms in the basement of the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center, Andrew Cortner ’17 turned off the lights, powered on the projector and began his presentation. Cortner’s presentation was about “Feeling Blue,” an up-and-coming student health magazine created by Dear Sam, Andover’s student health club. Cortner is one of many students beginning to use the new center, which was designed with hopes of expanding health and wellness opportunities at Andover.\nThe Wellness Center opened at the beginning of Winter Term and combines both mental and physical health treatment facilities, as part of an increasing focus on “Empathy & Balance” in the Strategic Plan. The center aims to be the epicenter of the community in addition to being an infirmary by incorporating not only medical facilities but also spaces for yoga, conference rooms, an open garden to host school events and a newly designed sleep room.\n“Kids don’t have to just come to the health center for health and wellness individual appointments,” said Carol Israel, Director of Counseling. “The [Wellness Center] will be sponsoring activities that bring people in. You don’t have to have a problem with your health – medical or psychological. We really will have many more educational activities. The community piece is what we’ll do much more easily.”\nThe Sykes Wellness Center signifies a shift in priorities among the faculty and staff at Andover, Israel said.\n“I think too often we put our own health on hold,” said Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students. “We really need to be taking care of ourselves and recognizing how central [it] is for us to be able to be really productive members of our community. So I think that in some ways, we’ve gotten off track a bit, and I’m hoping [the Wellness Center] is going to be a building that sort of grounds us again.”\nBy merging of the counseling staff and medical staff, the Wellness Center hopes to encourage students to reach out and take initiative to receive the appropriate care.\n“A huge advantage to [the Wellness Center] is having multiple services under one roof, so that the student experience can be enhanced… We wanted to make it a place where people would want to go and not shy away, and [we also wanted] to make it easy for students to access the care that they needed,” said Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-director of Wellness Education.\nThe fusion of both physical and mental health services as well as the addition of conference centers and study spaces are purposed to remove the stigma of seeking support from counselors.\n“I definitely think it reduces [the stigma around counseling]… people could be walking there for any reason. You just walk up to the front desk, and you could be going in there for a PACE class or you might be sick or you might want to talk to a counselor. Nobody needs to know except for you, and that’s kind of important because it’s really up to you to take the step and seek whatever assistance you need,” said Cortner.\nThe Sykes Wellness Center plans to continue all efforts of providing services related to sexual health.\n“We still have reproductive health services, contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and opportunities for one-on-one or group conversations in all areas of sexual health in the Sykes Wellness Center,” said Patel.\nThe Wellness  Center prioritizes outreach and works to invite students to discuss and gain awareness of health and wellness. There are plans to host panels on eating disorders, depression and anxiety where the speakers invited and clubs surrounding emotional and physical health will actively encourage students to engage in the Wellness Center and lead healthy lifestyles.\n“There [will be] a wellness activity every Sunday on ‘The Weekender’… [that] came with the idea of the Wellness Center. Now, you’ve got your movies, you’ve got your dances and you’ve got your Sunday wellness activity that’s going to happen at the Sykes Wellness Center. That’s something for the whole community – not just for kids who have a headache or kids that are stressed,” said Israel.\nAside from the current services offered, the Wellness Center staff is also developing a new health and wellness curriculum designed to take place throughout all four years of an Andover student’s education. The curriculum will combine PACE with some new courses addressing issues of health, wellness, empathy and balance.\n“The curriculum will be some about how we treat each other, in terms of race, class, culture, gender [and] some about how we treat ourselves, in terms of basic self care, drugs and alcohol, eating disorders [and] sexuality… The idea is that there’s a recognition of taking care of individual community health, and wellness shouldn’t be a side issue,” said Israel.\nThe Wellness Center team is also working to provide more skill-based training concerning drugs and alcohol to students as preventative measures in response to the recent Taylor Hall contraband incident, where several cluster deans and faculty members conducted a dorm-wide search and found drug-related paraphernalia and alcohol in about a third of the rooms. With plans to hold informational classes and discussions on substance abuse, the Wellness Center staff aims to teach students how they can handle their emotions and deal with stress productively.\n“There’ll be a big push to do more stress management stuff… It’s not saying don’t do drugs or don’t drink. It’s saying: here, let’s give you a variety of ways to cope with stress and to cope with peer pressure, so you have some options of what to do in those situations. It’s skill building rather than giving you the facts. It’s building your skills to handle peer pressure, stress and intense emotions,” said Israel.\nFrom the beginning, the Wellness Center was designed specifically to promote health and wellness through both the educational services offered and the architectural components that include bright colors and a spacious layout.\n“The focus is on wellness and prevention so that students and the community can achieve their personal best: physically, mentally, emotionally. Providing education and information with that focus in mind has been built into everything. [For] example, the waiting room was designed with video capability to deliver healthy tips, mindfulness strategies and wellness education,” said Catherine Golas, Administrative Director of the Wellness Center.\nStudents’ reactions to the center, thus far, have been positive. The uplifting atmosphere of the Wellness Center is attracting students from all grades, either for health purposes, special speakers, club meetings or studying.\n“When you walk into the new [Wellness] Center, you see all the most up-to-date technology. You see the staff buzzing around… They’ve created some new classrooms, where they can actually use the Wellness Center for more educational components rather than just [a] treatment center,” said Michael Najem ’16.\n“I’d like to see more thought process go into how the classrooms and basement of the Wellness Center could be used for education purposes rather than just counseling, as PACE classes have already begun taking place there,” said Najem.\nSeveral students also believe that the Wellness Center will inspire the entire community to focus more on well-being. The location of the Wellness Center at the heart of campus, rather than having the Isham Health Center in West Quad North and Graham House in Abbot, makes the new facilities more accessible to students and allows them to visit the new building with ease.\n“It’ll be easier for students to access [the Wellness Center] and it’ll be useful for them so when they need support they’ll all be in one place. They don’t need to go around campus everyday…I would use it more if I knew that those two were connected in one place, and if I get sick, it will be easier to walk to the middle of campus and not go away to the edge of campus,” said Serena Liu ’19.\nIn the future, the Sykes Wellness Center staff hopes to have students use the Wellness Center more frequently by regaining the homey atmosphere of Graham House.\n“I bet there’s some nostalgia around parts of Isham [but] there was a real readiness for there to be a new medical space. I think, like any change, especially a change mid-year, there’s sort of a shifting of patterns and routines in terms of getting used to a new building,” said Elliott.\n“But the other piece I guess I would offer… I think the centrality of the physical location on our campus is huge. And it’s really important  in terms of the message it sends to all of our community members that our wellness is really important,” continued Elliott.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nSporting an Aztec-patterned hoodie and a thick man bun, NestED speaker Nadeem Mazen ’02 returned to campus on Wednesday evening to discuss his passion for his work as an engineer, music-video director, software programmer and the first Muslim city councillor for the city of Cambridge.\nUpon graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 2006 with degrees in Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, Mazen went on to become Chief Executive of Serious Business, a Boston-based design and consulting firm specializing in interactive software, viral marketing and design. In addition to Serious Business, Mazen is the co-founder and C.E.O. of danger!awesome, a laser-cutting studio and community art storefront located in the heart of Cambridge, Mass.\n“You can do almost anything you love. You can figure out how to get funding from your peers or through sales and entrepreneurship and this often gives people who are passion-based a really strong launch pad to continue that lifestyle of following passion, being curious and having an impact,” said Mazen.\nAs he discussed his work as co-founder and C.E.O. of danger!awesome in his presentation, Mazen played “Last Leaf,” a music video by the band OK Go directed by Mazen and fellow M.I.T. graduate Ali Mohammed in 2010. Using stop-motion, the video features a unique combination of laser-cut images drawn in 3,000 pieces of toast.\n“[What I found most interesting about Mazen] is his commitment to accessibility and his willingness to break social structure conventions. I also like how he believes in trying something six times and doing it quickly and badly and improving on that, rather than trying to make something perfect the first time,” said Tamar Sifri ’16.\nIn his time at Andover, one of Mazen’s most valuable experiences included working on an independent project with Thomas Hodgson, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies, and looking at the precepts of American teaching and learning.\n“[The independent project] was really powerful because it gave me a chance to explore my passions in high school, which I had thought as the place where you follow rules and do what people tell you. I experienced [Andover] as a much more passion-based experience, especially towards the end of my time,” said Mazen.\n“I remember Nadeem as bright, hardworking, independent and principled. He clearly continues to exemplify all of those qualities in ways that are ever more admirable. I am particularly inspired by his work on the Cambridge City Council. He combines hard work, honesty, persistence, articulateness, courage and commitment to the general good in ways that are exemplary,” said Hodgson.\nAt Andover, Mazen was also a member of Boys Varsity Squash and Varsity Ultimate. He noted that the experiences he gained from both teams taught him about teamwork and leadership.\n“Ultimate Frisbee for me with [Head Coach] Scott Hoenig was incredible education and teamwork.  I wasn’t always succeeding, so I learned a lot about how not to lead and how to lead from [Hoenig’s] example and from people like Greg Booth ’02, who was the captain. Greg taught me a lot about the interpersonal aspects of being a high achiever,” said Mazen.\nMazen encourages students to find their passion and to find the balance between pursuing their passions and investing in a financial plan to support their endeavors.\n“I would definitely say find your passion. Find what makes you wake up early, despite four hours of sleep, to love. Find a way that you can attach it to some kind of financial process or plan. The idea of following your dreams is great… but you have to find that mix… so that you’re not left high and dry when you graduate and you’re like, ‘What am I supposed to do with my life?’ ” said Mazen.\nMazen first learned about the “maker movement,” the growth of the availability of spaces for innovation around the world, 15 years ago at the M.I.T. Media lab. He has since been a leading voice in education and the “maker movement.”\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nThe Disciplinary Committee (DC) is the cornerstone of the disciplinary system at Andover. It’s a rigorous and meticulous process that strives to prioritize student well-being, but one that has come under fire from students in recent weeks.\nAt the beginning of this Winter Term, Cluster Deans and Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students and Residential Life, conducted a dorm-wide search in Taylor Hall in response to a number of incidents committed by students of the dorm involving alcohol, tobacco products and illicit drugs over the course of the Fall Term and a group of over 50  students petitioned Head of School John Palfrey and faculty to reconsider a former student’s disciplinary outcome.\nAlthough the idea of a dorm-wide search was not chosen lightly, Elliott hoped it would send a clear message to students that the possession and use of illicit substances are not tolerated on campus.\n“We elected to take that course because we hoped it would help kids make better choices and lead to fewer DC’s – no one is looking to DC kids… But I think kids should know that when we know about rule-breaking, we’re going to follow up on it; we’re not going to ignore it or walk away,” said Elliott.\nRather than punishing students for rule-breaking, the DC process is designed to help students learn from their mistakes and to provide an opportunity for reflection and growth, several faculty members said.\n“The point of a DC is to be educational and to offer an opportunity for a student to reflect upon his or her decision-making and to think about how to make better choices moving forward. Andover’s disciplinary process rests at its core… in the belief that kids learn from their mistakes and that kids, with proper reflection, supervision and deliberate and proactive adjustment, will learn,” said Elliott.\nThis past Fall Term saw a total of nine DCs, far less than the 23 DCs of the Fall Term of 2014. The Fall Term of 2013 saw only two.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nAs a woman who has always labelled herself “bossy” and “outspoken,” Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English, knew during her first women’s studies class in college that she wanted to devote her life to feminism.\nHer interest in gender equality was first sparked during her time in high school. Staffaroni noticed at a young age that her male classmates did not endure the same kind of scrutiny that she experienced as a girl.\n“I felt like I was treated differently as a smart girl as opposed to my friends who were the smart boys… I definitely faced a lot of harassment and really problematic statements from my male peers in high school,” said Staffaroni in an interview with The Phillipian.\nShe continued, “Even if I felt like I was above it sometimes—I always felt like I wasn’t as entrenched in it as some of my other friends who were girls—I was just noticing it. It was not one event but an aggravation of a lot of really messed up things that I was seeing as a teenage girl.”\nIn college, Staffaroni began to understand the injustice she was experiencing. She learned the appropriate words and terms that helped her solidify her experiences into concrete thoughts about what it means to be a woman.\n“Even though by definition, [feminism] is gender equality or a world in which the genders are equal, I think that definition has fallen short for me over the years. I now think of it as a way of being where I am trying to bring injustice into the light and help myself and the people around me,” said Staffaroni.\nWhile Staffaroni believes that feminism is crucial in achieving complete equality for all persons, she also feels that there are many other important elements in working towards justice. Staffaroni grew up in a lower middle-class family, noting that her upbringing shaped her perspective and helped her to better comprehend social justice issues.\n“I think of feminism personally as becoming something else, growing toward justice. Gender is a big part of that, because it is a social force, but there are also other social forces such as racism and classism and homophobia that put us in our categories and divide us,” said Staffaroni.\nAt Andover, Staffaroni teaches a Senior elective titled “A Room of Their Own,” a course focused on women’s literature. Through essays, short stories and artwork, Staffaroni strives to highlight the plurality of feminism, and she emphasizes the idea that feminism alone will not achieve justice.\n“[The authors read in class] are all women and in their writing they teach us about the history of feminism. I wouldn’t say that their books are necessarily activism, I just kind of put them in a category to study feminist thinking, gender, equality… that includes race and class and a lot of other things too,” said Staffaroni.\nOn campus, Staffaroni is also an advisor for Women’s Forum (WoFo). She regularly meets with the board of the club to discuss possible issues relating to feminism.\n“I love working with WoFo because it is not a classroom: it is just a space to express oneself and for me to get a sense of the field of feminism. Every week in WoFo it is a different topic and different people show up and different people express their own view of a more genderly-just world,” said Staffaroni.\nCarmen Bango ’16, a member of the WoFo board, said, “[Staffaroni] has this visible understanding in a way. She definitely shows that she values your input but she also just gives you so many valuable new things to think about and so I think it is a lot about mutual respect, and she is just a really genuinely kind and beautiful person inside and out.”\nAmong her many role models, Staffaroni praised Roxane Gay, cultural critic, writer and editor, in particular.\n“I read [Gay’s] book and devoured it in one sitting. She wants to make sure that feminism fits people living their lives,” said Staffaroni.\nStaffaroni especially takes Gay’s advice into account when facing adversity. Although she believes that there will always be a stigma associated with feminism, she has learned to take the high road in these situations and tries to listen and understand where people who oppose feminism are coming from.\n“I kind of like having some adversaries, it keeps me sharp… The hard part is figuring out where those people are, what are the biases that are preventing them from seeing that as the case. The stigma here is a little bit like the stigma everywhere, when you have the power you want to hold onto it. When you have privilege, you are blind to it,” said Staffaroni.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nAfter a-year-and-a-half-long process, faculty members and other administrators have narrowed the four potential scheduling and calendar options for the 2017-2018 school year down to two final options. The remaining two proposals are the current schedule, which may be subject to revision, and a four-term schedule with five periods, called the four-by-five schedule.\nNow that the options have been reduced, faculty and administration will spend the coming weeks holding discussions addressing issues and details of both choices. From now until the end of January, which is when the final vote will take place, faculty will be able to come forward with any revisions or ideas that can tweak the two schedules.\n“We wanted to reflect the school core values… for there to be time available for extra help and unstructured time for students. We also wanted to increase opportunities for collaboration [between] faculty and students,” said Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning.\nMonday faculty meetings have been providing an opportunity for the faculty to discuss how each of the scheduling options would affect students’ and faculty members’ lives on campus.\n“I think people are being very thoughtful about the impact on life at school, academic and otherwise. Concerns that people have with either schedule is about good faith, what’s best for the academy and what’s best for the school. Although there is debate, I think it’s constructive debate,” said Skiffer.\nFaculty members who voted for the rejected schedules and still wish to vote must choose between the two remaining ones.\n“I’m still thinking about the decision. There are things I like about the four-by-five. I think longer periods have a lot of potential, but I have a lot of concerns as well… There are tweaks within our current schedule that might make sense, that wouldn’t require totally overhauling the schedule, but could address some of the main issues that people are having,” said Willa Abel, Instructor in Biology.\n“I’m in favor of [four-by-five] schedule that will allow for more meaningful class time. The current schedule, as far as I’m concerned, does not allow for that. And I think it is in the best interest of the Academy and in the best interest of students to have a schedule that will improve the quality of life on campus,” said Damany Fisher, Instructor in History and Social Sciences.\nIn addition, different departments generally have been seen to favor different schedule choices.\nFor the Music Department, the four-by-five scheduling option poses a problem because of the lack of red-dot periods for Juniors. Much of the department’s activities, such as music lessons, chamber music and orchestra, happen outside of the academic day.\n“The four-by-five is a little bit challenging because incoming ninth graders will be very difficult to schedule… It would seem like everyone has free times at the same time, and we do not have enough practice rooms to accommodate everybody,” said Holly Barnes, Director of Performance in the Music Department.\nThe Art Department also expressed both pros and cons for the two options.\n“The longer time periods are very good for the Art Department… On the other hand, because our department is mostly term-contained courses, four start-ups during the year would be exhausting, especially with very little break in between,” said Elaine Crivelli, Instructor in Art.\n“A lot of the faculty feel like they are ready for some kind of thoughtful change in the way we teach and organize our time, and are hoping that we make a change [by] either tweaking the current schedule or the four-by-five,” said Barnes.\nThe Schedule/Calendar Implementation Working Group will be holding informational meetings in the Mural Room next week. At the event, students will be given the opportunity to learn more about and provide feedback on the two schedule options.\nStudents have already been expressing varying opinions about the remaining two schedule options, prior to the meeting.\n“Personally, I don’t like the 75-minute periods, because I find it a bit hard for students to stay focused for that long of a period. I feel like it would be a good idea if teachers could add a five minute break, or like a break in between,” said Andy Salitre ’18.\nWhile Claire Jungmann ’18 also said that longer classes can be difficult, she said that having less homework and more time for extracurriculars and sports would be beneficial.\nThe times for the information session next week include Monday from 5:00 to 6:30 p.m., Tuesday during class periods four through six, Thursday from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. and Friday during class periods four through six.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nEvery morning, Chief of Staff Dan Koh ’03 eats an egg white – and drinks a Diet Coke – for breakfast, reading over digests of the day’s news for Boston. At 6:45 a.m., Koh and Marty Walsh, Mayor of Boston, have a standing call where they offer their insights to the news, reactions and responses, and talk logistically about the day ahead. By 8:30 a.m., Koh is at City Hall to meet with the mayor’s administration about the day’s priorities, according to “Boston.com.”\nShuffling from meeting to meeting – whose topics can cover education, housing or public safety, among a whole host of other city-related nuances – Koh is responsible for talking to locals and administrators in Boston and advising Walsh on all political matters. Each day in the office proves to be hectic for Koh, but also incredibly rewarding.\n“I think what I enjoy most is that there are so many different things that are relevant to the work I do. There’s no specific subject matter in a given day,” said Koh. “It’s our responsibility to not only understand what is going on in each of those but also help advise the mayor on decisions he’s going to make regarding Boston and those areas. So [my job] forces me to really understand a number of different things.”\nFrom 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., Koh meets in City Hall with the chief of policy, the chief legal counsel, the chief of operations and the C.F.O., where they discuss the day’s agenda.\nWhile he has found his passion in government and politics, the future was not always clear-cut for Koh. In an interview with The Phillipian, Koh reflected on how he, like many Andover students, was once unsure about what he wanted to do with his career.\n“A lot of times – especially when I was at Andover, I was kind of worried about the one thing I need to do in high school or college for my career, and I think one of the things I’ve learned is that you can do a lot of different things that lead you to opportunities that you wouldn’t expect,” said Koh.\nKoh found that the diversity he experienced at Andover helped shape the way he thinks in his career and allowed for his cultivation of networking skills after graduation.\n“From day one [at]   Andover, you not only feel like you’re among top faculty, but [you feel like] you’re also among kids who have a huge diversity of backgrounds from all over the world,” said Koh.\n“[Alums] not only have a great network, so when you go to different places you can see people from Andover that you know, but it gives you a different perspective on life that you wouldn’t normally have,” said Koh.\nIn the summer of his Upper Year at Andover, Koh worked at the late Senator Ted Kennedy’s Boston office and was immersed in all aspects of the political business. There, he learned basic services, such as writing letters and answering phone calls. After graduating from Harvard College in 2007 with a Bachelor’s Degree in government, Koh completed a one-year fellowship with the late Boston Mayor Tom Menino, and then worked at “The Huffington Post” for two years before returning to Boston to serve as Walsh’s Chief of Staff.\n“[Working in public service] forces me to really understand a number of different things, and it forces me to be really up on the news everyday. No matter what job you have, I think it’s helpful to really be up on the news, so this is a great opportunity to do that while doing it for a full-time living,” he said.\nKoh credits the teachers he met at Andover for helping prepare him to take on the daunting and fast-paced job of Chief of Staff. One of those relationships was an unlikely connection to Leon Modeste, Director of Athletics, on a community service trip to South Carolina, and was inspired by Modeste’s leadership as a football coach.\n“Consistently upbeat, [Koh] has always radiated a positive energy that makes others want to follow in his lead. While here, [Koh] earned the respect of both faculty and students because of his respect for all,” said Modeste in an interview with The Phillipian.\nSeth Bardo, Instructor in English and a teacher to Koh in his Junior year, said, “[Koh]’s exceptional qualities were instilled by his family, his dedicated parents and his exemplary siblings. He came to Andover as a young boy who, unlike most of his adolescent peers, already possessed a mature moral compass, one that has continued to guide him.”\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2016'), ('\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, and several cluster deans and house counselors conducted a full search of students’ rooms in Taylor Hall last Friday night, marking the first dorm-wide search in at least seven years. The deans found contraband material, ranging from items in violation of fire code to drug paraphernalia and illicit substances, in about a third of the rooms, Elliott said.\nThe decision to search Taylor was made in response to a number of incidents involving alcohol, tobacco products and illicit drugs over the course of the Fall Term, Elliott said.\n“Fall Term opened with a pretty public incident, where there was alcohol in the dorm refrigerator, and we communicated with all the boys at that point and with their families, to make it really clear that that was unacceptable and incredibly worrisome,” she said in an interview with The Phillipian. “We had a difficult case at the end of last term, and that’s the moment when it really solidified for us that we needed to do this because we were able to see some of the items that were being collected in boys’ rooms and that felt so problematic to us.”\nElliott also emphasized that the decision to conduct the search was not easy for her or the other school officials involved, including the Cluster Deans, Head of School John Palfrey and Linda Carter Griffith, Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion.\n“Our default is to trust our kids, our default is to protect their privacy, our default is to assume kids are making good decisions and good choices. That’s the way our system works. We try to have really clear rules and we try to trust our kids. … There is not an adult on campus who would like to search someone’s room. That’s not something we enter into with any enthusiasm or joy,” Elliott said.\nElliott continued, “But last term in Taylor Hall, there were enough rule violations and evidence of rule violations and ongoing use of marijuana, tobacco and drugs that made us feel really concerned for the safety of the boys.”\nPalfrey wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Decisions of this sort are reached by the deans as a collaborative matter. Given how unusual the approach was in this case, the deans consulted me as the Head of School, and I fully supported their decision. The step to search a dorm is highly unusual and is one that no adult on campus wants to take – ever – but in this case, the deans believed it was necessary to ensure that all students can start the new term in an environment free from drugs and alcohol in the dorm.”\nWill Hartemink ’17, a resident of Taylor Hall, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Certainly, the search was uncomfortable, but I think it was necessary. Throughout my two years in Taylor, I have seen this dorm plagued with unbelievable filth, theft, drugs and outright awful behavior. This has to end.”\nElliott added that she had hoped that responses to previous infractions in the dorm throughout the year would limit rule-breaking and that the residents of the dorm were given the opportunity to change their behavior before the search occurred.\n“We gave all the boys an opportunity at that point to clear the dorm of any drugs, alcohol, tobacco, drug-paraphernalia without any discipline involved,” said Elliott. “That’s not a usual decision, but we felt that was a moment to try to help them help themselves. We asked boys to call [the Sanctuary Policy] for kids they were worried about. Some did, and we’ve pursued those sanctuaries and tried to follow-up with support for those students. Typically when kids get in trouble, there is usually a collective response in the dormitory. The kids curb their habits. They figure out ways to be safer, and we were not seeing that. I think that was what was really worrisome to us.”\nThe deans decided to conduct the search over the first weekend of Winter Term in order to prevent any more incidents from occurring in the dorm, Elliott said.\n“December is often the time when kids do make bad decisions. They don’t have as much work, they’re not as stressed, they don’t feel as if there’s much to lose,” she added.\nBefore the search, the dorm’s residents gathered for a dorm munch and meeting, during which Kate Dolan, Dean of West Quad South Cluster, and Nile Blunt, Brian Faulk and Donald Slater, all house counselors in Taylor, notified students of the deans’ decision and the reasoning behind it. Students’ cell phones were then collected but not searched.\n“[Searching phones] feels pretty invasive. … We just didn’t want [students] to get into any more trouble if they try to contact each other,” Elliott said.\nThe search itself was conducted by Elliott, Dolan, Blunt, Faulk, Slater and Martha Fenton, Dean of West Quad North Cluster, David Gardner, Dean of Pine Knoll Cluster, Theodore Parker, Dean of Abbot Cluster and Matthew Hession, Dean of Flagstaff Cluster. In accordance with the policy articulated in the Blue Book, two adults searched each room in the presence of the student living in the room.\nHartemink said that the adults searching his room first asked him if there was any contraband material in the room before conducting a thorough examination.\n“They searched my desk, my closet, my bed and all the furniture I had. They even moved the furniture from the walls and removed my bedsheets to see if I hid anything there, too,” he said.\nBlunt said, “I am concerned about the amount of these things that were found; I am concerned about the safety and decision making of the boys in the dorm. But I am also focused on the fact that two-thirds of the boys had nothing in their rooms, two-thirds of the boys were happy for us to search their rooms and for us to see that this idea that it’s just a frat house in Taylor Hall is just not true.”\nElliott said that, although there were no plans for more dorm searches in the immediate future, she hopes to see a positive shift in the culture of the dorm and the student body. Both faculty members and students expressed a desire for greater dialogue about issues like drug use on campus.\nPalfrey said, “Mrs. Elliott, the deans and I are very open to hearing from students about ideas you might have about how to establish a greater culture of accountability and trust at Andover, on issues of drugs and alcohol use and otherwise.”\n“If students feel like there are outside resources they feel we need to bring in, or conversations that we need to facilitate or create … game on. I am ready and willing. I am happy to take that feedback from kids and partner with them and figure out how to support their efforts. That is what I am looking to do. I don’t want to be having more dorm searches. I would much rather be thinking about educational preventive, proactive measures we can make to make kids feel empowered and to make this place safer,” Elliott added.\nHartemink said, “The solution to drug abuse on campus goes far beyond our drug policy. I believe that we need to increase our support for students on campus … We need to organize student events that will serve as positive stress-releases as opposed to the addictive negative ones that some of our peers have fallen into. And we also need to watch out for one another.”\n\n', 'Dec 11, 2015'), ('\nNoticing the issue of transgender insensitivity that single sex boys’ and girls’ dorms have been perpetuating on Andover’s campus, Karissa Kang ’17 proposed an all-gender housing system during her Brace Fellowship Presentation on Monday.\nKang’s presentation, entitled “A Proposal for All-Gender Housing,” discussed the importance of incorporating all-gender housing at Andover to include the three percent of students, roughly 30 students, who do not identify as male or female, but rather as transgender, gender-fluid or other identities, according to The Phillipian’s 2015 “State of the Academy.”\n“While you may not think that 30 students is a lot, this number is predicted to grow in coming years. The number of children, according to the English Nation Health Service, [with] transgender feelings has quadrupled actually in the past five years [and] that is indicative of what will happen in the future,” said Kang during the presentation.\nCurrently, only a handful of prep schools have made progress in transgender inclusivity on their campuses. At Deerfield Academy, co-ed dorms, in which girls and boys live on different floors in a building, are being implemented. Similarly, Andover and Exeter have begun to incorporate gender-inclusive restroom signs on their respective campuses.\nKang said, “But other than [the co-ed dorms and gender-inclusive restroom signs], not much has been done. None of our peer prep schools have implemented any kind of all-gender housing… housing students of all genders without thinking about gender… or anything to accommodate transgender students at all really. That’s why I started this proposal.”\n“All-gender housing simply [and] explicitly suggests that this housing is for people of all genders, and I figured that that was the best way to go [for Andover],” said Kang.\nKang found that there were three common types of gender-neutral or mixed gender dorms: dorms that separate genders by floor, dorms that incorporate all genders without segregation and dorms that include, but separate, all genders.\nKang decided to focus her proposal on suggesting all-gender housing, without separation, as a possibility for Andover.\nKang said that the term “gender neutral” conveys an odd connotation, which suggests that students in these housing are almost stripped of their genders or neutered while the term “co-ed” suggested that only those defined as either girls or boys could be housed.\nKang discussed the basic pillars of her plan, which include: educating faculty members on gender identity issues and having an even distribution of large all-gender dorms on campus for students of all grades.\nIn addition, Kang addressed potential drawbacks to her plan, such as the exploitation of an all-gender dorm in the form of sexual assault by heterosexual males, in particular.\n“Sexual assault exists on the Andover campus, but all-gender housing shouldn’t exacerbate that problem… I even feel like it could help fix the problem because I think that sexual assault doesn’t occur because of passion or lust. [Occurrences of] sexual assault are acts of power and control [but] if we are making a safe space… we could be helping better relations between students of all genders,” said Kang.\nAlthough transgender students only constitute a small portion of the student body, this number will grow in the future, and the issue of inclusive, all-gender dorms needs to be further discussed, said Kang.\nTheodore Perez ’16, an attendee of the event, felt that the most impactful part of Kang’s presentation was the call for change with housing on campus.\n“The implementation of [all-gender housing] would be revolutionary at a high school in that there’s a lot of traditional values that are held when it comes to high school residential life… The idea of separate general gender housing is…more powerful than just the norm, it is what exists.”\n“I believe, the idea of implementing a system that changes that is revolutionary at a high school level and that changes the whole game. It makes us redefine how we define residential life.” continued Perez.\nFlavia Vidal, Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and an attendee of the presentation, also agreed with Kang’s message of inclusion.\n“For some [transgender students, it] would be four years, four very formidable years of their lives, in the place they should feel comfortable. It is a horrible thing not to feel comfortable in your own home. So the least we can do is to provide students a safe and comfortable space where they can be themselves and express their gender identity,” said Vidal.\n\n', 'Dec 10, 2015'), ('\nFor the first time since 2009, an Andover alum has received the Rhodes Scholarship and will join 32 other American Scholars at Oxford University, England, starting next October.\nZachary Fine ’11 is Andover’s first recipient of the Rhodes Scholarship in six years, following Abigail Seldin ’05 and Jisung Park ’04, who were both in Rhodes Scholars in 2009. Fine will embark on a new educational journey at Oxford University where he plans to pursue a Master’s degree in both art history and criminology at Oxford.\nThe Rhodes Scholarship was created in 1902 to send students selected from all 50 states and the District of Columbia to Oxford University in England. The Rhodes Scholars’ expenses are fully paid for by a scholarship funded through the Rhodes Trust, a British charity formed in honor of Cecil J. Rhodes. There is a one percent acceptance rate, through which 32 Americans are selected every year.\nFine came to Andover two years after Hurricane Katrina struck his hometown of New Orleans, LA., seeing the campus as better for him, in terms of academics, than schools back home. He graduated summa cum laude from New York University (NYU) last year and received a Bachelor’s degree in art history. Fine is particularly interested in the usage of photography in law enforcement and believes that Oxford University will present him with more opportunities for interdisciplinary work within the two fields.\n“My hope is to work in ways, through my time at Oxford and beyond, that allow me to pursue my intellectual investments inside [Oxford], while also transporting fruits from certain discourses into the public sphere—in the form of writing, activism, and eventually policy work,” wrote Fine in an email to The Phillipian.\n“What is remarkable about the Rhodes Trust is that it does not encourage scholars to use the scholarship as a free-ride or fast-track to their careers-of-choice. Rather, the hope is that many scholars will spend time at Oxford pursuing graduate study that allows them to branch out and take intellectual risks, without the encumbrance of high tuition costs and other expenses,” said Fine.\nDuring his time at Andover, Fine developed a close relationship with David Fox, Instructor in English, that further led to his exploration of visual art and its history. Although he initially joined Fox’s art history class due to a scheduling error, Fine developed a fascination for art and what he could observe in museums. During Spring Term of his Senior year, Fine collaborated with Fox on an Independent Project in which he presented ways to utilize Michel Foucault’s work to think about Paul Cezanne’s influence on Pablo Picasso’s art.\n“[Fine] stood out in maturity and I think how he interacted with adults on campus, not calculated in any way, just very genuine and it was like building a partnership even though there is always a power dynamic between teacher and student,” said Fox said in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAfter his graduation from Andover, Fine maintained his connection with Fox and was even invited back onto campus to teach several of Fox’s classes. Fine returned to lead a class titled “Relativity, Incompleteness, Subjectivity” with Fox this November, and they also attended the Origins of Modern Visual Culture class at Columbia University.\n“In the past couple of years, I have had the opportunity to remain close with Mr. Fox and to also collaborate with him on a couple of small projects. When we talk, or simply when I monitor my own habits of thought and writing, I am always reminded of how important his humbly offered guidance has been, even as I continue to take my own work into new directions,” wrote Fine.\n“So many faculty members are kind and thoughtful, and some are willing to offer all varieties of wisdom and counsel to students – especially those that get to know them – that texts and classes alone cannot supply,”  he continued. “I was fortunate enough to develop a number of strong relationships with faculty, at both Andover and NYU; a handful of them have proven to be some of the most important I will ever have.”\n\n', 'Dec 10, 2015'), ('\nAwash with natural light, its walls covered with brightly colored paint, the Rebecca M.

Featuring low volatile organic compound (VOC) paints and geothermal walls, the Center promotes environmentally-friendly practices.\nDr. Amy Patel, Medical Director and Co-Director of Wellness Education, said, “We’re excited to have the LEED certification because it’s just an external certification that this building is not only functional for [physical] health and being, but it’s also a building that supports health and well-being to everybody that enters it.”\nSet on the hill between Bulfinch Hall and Benner House, the Sykes Wellness Center’s unique design allows it to take advantage of the elevation change while maintaining a contemporary feel. Throughout the construction of the center, the project team relied on recycled materials and renewable products whenever possible.\nLarry Muench, Director of Facilities, said, “[Andover] cares deeply about sustainability and made the decision to assign resources to achieve that level for this building. We work hard to incorporate sustainability into every project on campus, whether it be through equipment or operations.”\nOne aspect of the Sykes Wellness Center is its ability to maintain student privacy, as it functions as both a health and counseling center. In addition, the Sykes Wellness Center offers space for classes, clubs and studying.\n“Students can be here for all sorts of reasons, so being able to help maintain that anonymity and privacy that some students seek while also being an extremely accessible community building is really exciting,” said Patel.\nThe exterior of the Skyes Wellness Center also features the East Garden, an area in the back of the Center complete with benches and a patio.\n“My personal favorite [aspect of the Center] is the [East] Garden. It’s so beautiful, and even with all the leaves having fallen off the bushes and the trees, it’s still so gorgeous. I think that it will just be another serene place on campus for students to be able to either sit quietly, reflect, have an outdoor class or just have a little mindful moment,” said Patel.\nEastlyn Frankel ’18 said, “In comparison to Isham, there are a ton of windows. The walls are light yellow, so it makes everything seem more open and happier.”\nPatel hopes the Sykes Wellness Center will provide a space for students to relax or get help if needed.\n“One of my favorite things is to interact with students after they’ve taken a look at the building, and [see] how they marvel at how incredible this building is, how beautiful it is and how it’s an asset to the community. I love seeing that, because this is ultimately for the students,” said Patel.\nThe Sykes Wellness Center plans to host guest speakers in the future and will hold an official dedication ceremony on May 6, 2016.

This arrival was much anticipated after a monsoon devastated the city of Chennai, leaving participants stranded in the airport until they could safely make their way back to Boston.\nThe Niswarth Hoops Program is a trip centered around the themes of “gratitude, humility and teamwork,” said Rajesh Mundra, Director of the Niswarth Program and Associate Dean of Students. In total, there were 20 students from both the Girls and Boys Varsity Basketball teams who traveled to Chennai for the program.\nThe students on the trip visited sites in Chennai, helped facilitate one-day basketball camps at five different schools and shadowed students at the American School of Chennai. Accompanying the students were Mundra, Terrell Ivory ’00, Head Coach of Andover Boys Basketball and Lani Silversides, Head Coach of Andover Girls Basketball.\n“We visited a hospital dedicated to study AIDS and help specifically people who’ve contracted the HIV virus. Later, we visited ECO kitchen, [an environmentally friendly kitchen] that mass produces food for the poor,” said Matt Shea ’18.\n“Both teams also visited a cultural site, Mahabalipuram, an ancient civilization. In the middle of the trip we stayed with families who live in Chennai for two nights, and on the last day we visited the U.S. Consulate and met the Consulate General,” Shea added.\nOn a visit to the St. Louis College for the Deaf in Chennai, Shea recalled learning how to communicate in sign language as “moving and educational.” After the fun was over and it was time to leave the school, a group of St. Louis students asked Shea to stay behind for a small surprise. Waiting for him was a young boy who signed, “Thank you for visiting our school.”\n“We interacted with children in many different environments to promote ideas of teamwork, community, leadership, focus and fun through sport,” said Mundra. “In doing so, we supported students who had attended basketball campus and were implementing lessons learned to their classroom education.”\n“My favorite experience would definitely be going to the government schools each morning. I just loved meeting all of the younger kids. The government schools didn’t have many resources but just to see all of the kids happy and eager to learn was a joyful experience,” said Teagan Cayla ’18.\nAs the students and faculty were done with the Niswarth Hoops program and ready to leave for the United States, a monsoon hit Chennai, effectively shutting down the airport. The monsoon had caused flooding throughout the city with the record-breaking rainfall. The flood submerged houses, shops and offices, devastating property and injuring civilians. The monsoon flooded the airport, delaying the flight of the students attending the program and other travellers.\n“The downpour… was insane. When we were driving to the airport, we saw people getting off their motorcycle and pushing it along the road because the water was up so much and they couldn’t drive anymore,” said Bailey Colon ’18.\nIn the aftermath of the Chennai floods, 1.8 million people have been displaced. According to the Red Cross, 300 people have been killed in the floods. The rain that fell during the monsoon has been the worst rainfall in India in the past 100 years. The monsoon was caused by “a super-charged northeast monsoon” and “prevailing winds [blowing] from northeast to southwest across the country,” according to NASA.\n“We ended up staying at the Chennai Airport for about 50 hours,” said Ivory. “Our flight was supposed to have left on Wednesday, and we left the hotel around 4 a.m. and normally it takes 30 minutes to get to the airport, but it ended up taking us four hours. We got to the airport at 8 a.m. for a flight at 9:50 a.m. After, we went through security and shortly before we left, we found out that our flight was delayed. There was no way to know how long we were going to have to wait.”\nFaculty back at Andover attempted to help participants by requesting that the State Department and the Indian government find a way to quickly evacuate the students and faculty in the Niswarth Hoops Program. Ultimately, students and faculty took a nine-hour bus ride to the city of Bangalore, a city unaffected by the monsoon, and stayed in a hotel there for two days before boarding a long flight back to the United States. They stopped in New Delhi and Newark, NJ., before arriving in Boston.\n“[The situation] was a little scary, not being able to leave a foreign country, and I didn’t know what the plan was, so I wasn’t sure when we were leaving,” said Colon. “I was worried, but I knew that Mundra, Silversides and [Ivory] were going to get us out of there, and I knew we’d be home before Christmas break.”\n\n', 'Dec 10, 2015'), ('\nFernando Alonso, Director of Outreach and Summer Session and Instructor in Mathematics, and Andrea Nix, Director of Finance and Assistant Treasurer, have been selected to become the new Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), respectively.\nAlonso and Nix will replace Stephen Carter, who held both positions simultaneously as Chief Operating and Financial Officer. After 36 years of serving as an administrator, Carter plans to retire next summer.\nCarter said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Alonso has done a great job with the Summer Session. He is very knowledgeable about the operation of the school. He understands the academic program very clearly, and the needs of the academic program, as well as the needs of residential life.”\n“Nix is very knowledgeable about financial matters across the board. She has been a financial officer before. She knows all financial stuff inside and out. She’s very qualified,” he continued.\nIn their new roles, Alonso and Nix will be in charge of handling a variety of finance-related projects.\n“The two will work together a lot on budget, capital projects, facilities and salaries – all kinds of things where we spend lots of money. Alonso will oversee that, and Nix will do a lot of the behind-the-scenes work to put the pieces together,” said Carter.\nAlonso looks forward to shifting responsibilities in his new role as COO and working with new colleagues in several departments, including Human Resources, Finance, Technology and Risk Management.\n“I’ve been working with all those folks in my summer role, but this is slightly different because it is relating to the whole school [as opposed to just Summer Session], and so, [I’ll be] getting to work with those colleagues in a different way,” said Alonso.\nWhile Nix and Alonso assume their new positions, Carter reflects on his time at Andover, noting that his favorite part of being Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer has been looking toward the future in his work with financial modeling and projections.\n“I’ve enjoyed the people I’ve gotten to know, particularly on the staff side and the administrative side. I’ve enjoyed being part of interesting things at school, like two capital campaigns. I’ve enjoyed working on facilities projects. The thing I enjoy most about my job is the financial modeling and projecting out into the future and seeing where we are going.” said Carter.\nIn his time at Andover, Carter has served as a Cluster Dean, Associate Dean of Studies, Scheduling Officer and Dean of Students, prior to becoming Dean of Faculty in 2000. He became CFO in 2004 and took on the additional duties of COO in 2008.\nNix said, “I’m going to miss Carter very much. We’ve talked with Carter everyday since being here. I don’t think a single day has gone by that I haven’t talked to him. His institutional knowledge is deep and wide and his judgement is great…. He’s also a wonderful person, kind and generous.”\nAlonso said, “No one has ever been Dean of Students, Dean of Faculty and the CFO and COO of the school. I think that’s a testament to his knowledge of the institution. All of his jobs have had different skill sets. His ability to be able to work with the students, work with the faculty and work with the staff is certainly something we will all miss. I see the next sixth months as an opportunity to talk to him as much as I can and get as much advice as possible.”\nThe school has reached out to both internal and external candidates and hopes to hire someone to fill Alonso’s position as Director of Outreach and Summer Session by spring.

You are challenged: for the month of October, log your nightly sleep using any form of tracking — on a gadget or on a plain sheet of paper, it doesn’t matter. The honor system governs. I will also track my amount of sleep on a daily basis,” wrote Palfrey in an email to the student body.\nGatte averaged 11 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night, earning her the title as the student who logged the most hours of sleep. Although Gatte felt as if she was not qualified to compete due to the fact that she spent a week in Isham and a few days at Lawrence General Hospital, Gatte typically tries to go to bed every night by 10pm and wakes up before 9am.\n“I am a sleeping person. I go to sleep at 10, I have first free and I sleep as late as I can. I really think that my mood and my productivity is linked to the amount of sleep I get. I try to get as much sleep as possible but in a place like Andover, that’s kind of impossible,” said Gatte.\nGatte has a strict protocol before she goes to bed.

Since you’re focusing on the lines, your mind is already calm and it’s less active,” she said.\nAs a Post Graduate (PG) from France, Gatte understands that not everyone is in her position and that other students may have a bigger workload than she does. According to Gatte, she is relieved from the pressure that Seniors and other PGs may have about the college application process because she has already been admitted to a university.\n“I think that to get more sleep, students have to think that sleeping is as important that their academic results. It’s difficult, though; Students have the pressure of their grades so I can’t say that because I have it easy… But even if you’re tired during the day, just taking a nap helps,” said Gatte.\nAt the end of the competition, Palfrey gave out two FitBits. As the winner, Gatte won a Fitbit of her choice. All students participating in the sleep challenge received gift cards and were entered in a raffle for the second FitBit. Justin Muchnick ’16 won the raffle.\n“This competition just has to do with our emphasis on well-being and the fact that I believe that excellence in academics and other aspects of life can be consistent with getting enough sleep,” said Palfrey.\nHe continued, “[Getting more sleep] is something I work on all the time. I have a very busy job that pulls me in lots of different directions, but I feel like I perform better in every way if I’ve gotten at least eight hours of sleep, so that’s my goal for [the] month: to get eight hours of better sleep.”\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nAs music echoed around the Mural Room, members of the Andover community walked among tables lined with poster boards displaying various Community Engagement programs. Held on Tuesday evening, the Community Engagement Office held their first open house that introduced attendees to all 32 organizations affiliated with the office.\nEach individual program, including The Boys and Girls Club, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Pen Pals, featured posters describing their program activities at their respective tables. In addition, student community engagement coordinators stood at their designated program tables to answer questions and share personal experiences.\n“I think community engagement is just so different from any other interaction that you can have at Andover… You’re getting to work and learn with a bunch of different people and I think that’s a really great experience that Andover offers. And it’s just another way to learn,” said Lizzie McGonagle ’16, a coordinator of Bread Loaf Writing Workshop and Pen Pals.\nIn hopes of increasing awareness of existing Community Engagement programs offered to students on campus, the open house was an opportunity for students to learn about new programs in which they might be interested.\n“We have 32 programs that meet on a weekly basis with hundreds and hundreds of students. We just wanted to share what our students are doing every week with our community partners, both to students and faculty as well… we just want students to see that it is possible to fit [community engagement programs] into [their] very busy lives,” said Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Engagement.\nThe decision to hold the open house came after the department changed its name from the Office of Community Service to the Office of Community Engagement over the summer. Along with the new name change, the Office of Community Engagement plans to focus on promoting education regarding the importance of engaging a community.\n“We wanted to think of the work that we’re doing less as service – something we’re going to do to other people – and more about engagement where we’re learning… from other people as they are learning from us… It’s more about working with each other than us going and bestowing our goodness upon others,” said Cueto-Potts.\nMcGonagle feels the office name change is an attempt to create a bigger and more inclusive Community Engagement presence on campus.\n“I think a lot of what the office does is think about campus outreach and how we can work with other places – not necessarily work [with] other places as a service but work with them in [a way where] we’re trying to collaborate and learn something from the people,” said McGonagle.\n“We want to feel like we’re not going into communities to help them or serve them, but rather to engage with them and learn from them ourselves,” added Jenny Huang ’16, a coordinator of the Youth Development Organization Acting program.\nAccording to Julia Howard, Fellow in Community Engagement, the Community Engagement Office also hopes to make their office, currently located in the basement of the chapel, more visible and available for students on campus.\n“[Something] that we’re working on this year is to make our office more visible on campus because we do all these fantastic programs and so many students participate in them every year… hopefully [this open house] will bring these programs more to life for everyone in the community,” said Howard.\nThe Community Engagement Office believes that the posters, quotes and pictures at the open house effectively showcased the different programs on campus.\n“The posters [at the open house were] a good demonstration of the school’s community [engagement],” said Warren Christopher ’18, an attendee of the event. “The Andover Bread Loaf Society is doing some great work… I would like to join the service in the future.”\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nUpon coming to Andover, Skyler Sallick ’17 was amazed by the wide variety of discussions about beliefs and cultures on campus. Witnessing this dialogue inspired Sallick to bring “KidSpirit,” a magazine and website focusing on issues related to race, gender and religion, to Andover this year.\nWith satellite editorial boards in New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Maryland, California and New York, “KidSpirit” allows young people to explore topics pertaining to spiritual development from a variety of perspectives, according to the publication’s website.\nSallick said, “[‘KidSpirit’] creates this inclusive forum for people between the ages of 11 and 17 to talk about life’s big questions and to explore spiritual development in some ways… it’s very much personal experience [because] you’re writing about making connections with what happens in your life and what happens in other people’s lives,”\nSallick first found out about “KidSpirit” from her brother, Greer Sallick ’14, who was on the board of “KidSpirit” at his middle school. Through discussions with her brother, she became increasingly aware of the wide variety of issues that students around the world face.\n“Once I figured out that what we were talking about on campus was something that was similar to what ‘KidSpirit’ was talking about, and they kind of went really well together, I reached out to the founding editor,” said Skyler Sallick.\nSallick believes that “KidSpirit” will encourage students to open up and talk about issues both within and without the Andover community.\n“We [still] have a lot of different things that we can talk about with ‘KidSpirit’ that really, with Andover, we don’t really talk about… for example, a few weeks ago I was at a conference and we did a panel and talked about… why it’s important to be involved in discussions about interfaith, which is something we don’t really talk about around campus,” Skyler Sallick said.\nIn addition, Sallick also hopes that the global nature of “KidSpirit” will offer Andover students a wider range of perspectives: in the last issue alone, the publication’s writers hailed from over 15 different countries.\n“What we talk about is different than most of the world because ‘KidSpirit’ is so global and so inclusive so that there’s all these different perspectives that you wouldn’t otherwise see because of the Andover bubble issue,” she said.\nAs both the ambassador for the club and an editor for the magazine on campus, Sallick helps with the organization of everyone’s articles, plans the monthly meetings and reads through the articles before they are submitted to the magazine. When suggested themes are brought to the main editorial board stationed in New York for consideration and are later approved, the club at Andover writes about how the issue relates to problems on campus as well.\nSo far, Andover’s branch of “KidSpirit” has contributed several articles to the magazine and two of the articles have been published in “The Huffington Post,” Sallick said.\n“I think that what we have going so far is really working. It’s giving students voices in something bigger than just Andover,” she said. Sallick said that more Andover students will become involved and provide new opinions and beliefs for “KidSpirit.”\n“I think that’s something special that Andover can contribute to the magazine: the fact that we do talk every day and we are having all of these open conversations as a high school community… We can give a little something extra to the things that we write,” she added.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nAs summer drew to a close and students began planning for Fall Term, Teaching Fellows also began preparing for their year at Andover. For many fellows, this would be their first experience teaching at a boarding school. Just as systems are in place for supporting new students who feel nervous about beginning their Andover career, Teaching Fellows are aided in their transition to Andover by an orientation program developed by the Dean of Faculty’s Office.\nTeaching Fellow orientation lasts several days and includes seminars, meetings and discussions aimed at preparing fellows to be involved in the Andover community. In these seminars, teaching fellows are trained on subjects such as syllabi planning and student diversity.\n“I remember we had one event where we could just sit down and discuss syllabus and designing syllabi, and work within our department groups so that we could share ideas and figure out what it meant to plan a class… It was super useful for teaching fellows especially, because for a lot of us, it’s our first time teaching, and that discussion on the classroom really helped,” said Andrea Acosta, Teaching Fellow in English.\nTeaching fellows are also assigned a department mentor with whom they can meet to discuss questions about their coursework. Although some fellows have official meetings with their mentors every few weeks, many others see their mentors on a daily basis. The frequency of their meetings varies from pair to pair.\n“[My mentor, Peter Watt, Instructor in Physics, and I], our desks are right next to each other, so we talk to each other a lot… I bounce ideas off of him, see how he does certain lesson plans and use it as a guide… It’s a really nice feeling to talk to [Watt]. He’s been teaching Physics 400 for like 30 years, so he really knows what he’s doing,” said John Tortorello, Teaching Fellow in Physics.\nIn addition, Yasmine Allen, Instructor in Spanish, leads weekly seminars each Thursday for the teaching fellows. These meetings offer teaching fellows the opportunity to share their problems and concerns with each other.\n“Every week, [the teaching fellow seminars] usually range. There’s a range of topics from technology in classrooms to the attitude that you should convince your students to have,” said Alex Djamoos, Teaching Fellow in Russian.\n“I think that the week by week structure of [the seminars] makes sure that we’re supported and that if there’s any problems, then they’re addressed. If there’s something you can’t bring up with your mentor or is unrelated to your class [and] more related to your dorm, they have structures in place for those concerns to be raised and then addressed,” said Acosta.\nAs recent college graduates, teaching fellows had to adjust to life as a teacher for the first time, which includes a full schedule of new commitments.\n“For me it was probably just that it was the first year out of college, first year not as a student. I don’t really think it would matter what my job would be. It was different and it was harder in many ways because you don’t live on a campus full of all your friends and… you’re more independent,” said Tortorello.\n“Two things [were difficult to adjust to]. The first thing was buildings not having [air conditioning], and it was hot! I just moved here from Texas, so it was kind of weird for me not to have AC in buildings. Also, having a very full schedule… all these things happening. My head is always full with what I’m going to do,” said Djamoos.\nDespite the difficulty of their sudden immersion into campus life, Acosta says that she, as a teaching fellow, is treated as an equal by more experienced faculty members in the workplace.\n“The English Department is very conscientious about treating everybody – new faculty, old faculty, teaching fellows – as equals in faculty spaces… It is very apparent that they really want our opinions and our voices, because even though we’re younger and less experienced, we have the most recent scholarship and the most recent sense of how English is being taught at a university level right now,” said Acosta.\n“They affirm time and time again that we are important and valuable, and should speak up to offer our opinions. I’ve never found any problems with that,” she continued.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nAt the end of each November, Scott Hoenig, Instructor in Mathematics, shaves the mustache that he devoted the entire month to growing, taking photos as bits of his mustache are shorn off and the skin underneath is revealed. For the first time in a month, he is able to feel the breeze along his upper lip.\nHoenig is a member of the PA-Stacios, the first team at Andover devoted to Movember, a month in which males around the world grow out mustaches in support of men’s health.\nPA-Stacios started in 2012 under the leadership of Hoenig and Mark Cutler, Instructor in Spanish. The team, which has evolved over the past four years, now boasts 16 members, all of which are are committed to growing the best mustaches they can this month to support men’s health.\nThe PA-Stacios are part of an international organization called the Movember Foundation. The Movember Foundation donates more than 650 million dollars to over 1,000 international programs aimed at treating prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and physical inactivity in men, according the Movember Foundation website.\nThe goal for the PA-Stacios is both to raise money for the Movember Foundation and to raise awareness for men’s health within the Andover community.\nCutler said, “When you’re part of a team, there’s the added benefit of being able to raise money and awareness for men’s health—supporting public messaging and research for prostate cancer, mental health, obesity, etc. That’s the most important aspect of Movember, in my opinion.”\n“One thing I like is that Movember helps get men talking about health issues – sometimes it seems like men shouldn’t talk about stuff like that – especially mental health issues – but it’s so important to create an environment where men do feel comfortable talking about it,” said Hoenig.\nHoenig was first asked to participate in Movember in 2011 by his college friend who lived in Bordeaux, France. Before starting PA-Stacios, Hoenig was part of the Bordeaux Mustache Factory, another team who also engaged in Movember. Though Hoenig was not living in France, he stayed connected to his team through the Movember website and through Facebook.\nHoenig said, “Since I was the only faculty member on campus growing a mustache from scratch, I got a lot of questions and a lot of odd looks. Several colleagues and friends said they’d like to do it the next year, and that’s how the PA-Stacios got started.”\nOver the years, Hoenig and Cutler have enlisted the help of others interested in the cause around campus, including Donald Slater, Instructor in History and Social Science.\n“I am a huge hockey fan and was first introduced to Movember while watching a Boston Bruins game years ago. I was accustomed to playoff beards, but was at first confused by the mid-season mustache,” said Slater.\nEncouraged by Cutler and Hoenig to join the PA-Stacios in 2012, Slater has been an avid participant ever since.\n“Camaraderie and a good cause drive my participation in Movember,” said Slater. “Certainly the most enjoyable part of Movember is participating in the event with a bunch of great guys at Andover and comparing mustache progress at meetings, Commons and on campus pathways.”\nThe members of the PA-Stacios affectionately refer to one another as Mo-Bros. According to Hoenig, members try to complement each other rather than compete for the most impressive mustache.\n“The most challenging part is rocking the mustache itself. Truth be told, I think I look pretty goofy with a mustache,” said Slater.\nAnother member of the PA-Stacios is Stephen Silversides, Associate Director of College Counseling. Hoenig and Cutler recruited Silversides to the team during the first year of PA-Stacios. Silversides recalls seeing Hoenig with a mustache five years prior to the formation of the team, a memory that interested him in the cause.\n“It certainly piqued my curiosity as I knew nothing about Movember at the time. After learning more about the movement, I committed to growing a mustache every year as a means of supporting the cause,” said Silversides.\nPart of the PA-Stacios pledge is to participate with full effort in growing the best mustache possible; no beards or goatees are allowed. During Movember, participants are permitted to groom their mustaches – while some men use wax, Hoenig uses shampoo – he has not gotten into the fine art of waxing, he said.\n“It’s itchy when you grow it from scratch and it takes longer to shave in the morning,” said Hoenig. “Movember is officially just during the month of November, but I typically keep my mustache through mid-to-late December.  Once you put that much time and effort into growing it, it’s tough to let it go.”\nRather than feeling worried about how his mustache will look on him, Silversides seems to be more concerned with how his mustache will be styled.\n“Every year, I hope my hair follicles will enable me to grow an epic mustache, the likes of those sported by Clark Gable, Rollie Fingers or Tom Selleck. I would also settle for upper lip stylings of Ron Burgundy or The Monopoly Man,” said Silversides.\nMembers of the PA-Stacios gather at the end of every November to commemorate their participation in the Movember challenge. Their celebration is accompanied by multiple boxes of pizza; the events of the night all leading up to the grand election for the “Man of Movember,” the one member of the team displaying the best mustache.\n“It’s been a great way to get to know colleagues in a different way, to raise some money for a good cause and to have fun looking a little ridiculous,” said Hoenig.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nJennifer Savino, former Associate Director of Alumni Engagement, assumed her new role as the Director of of Alumni Engagement last Wednesday after 13 years of working with Phillips Academy and Abbot Academy alums.\nAs the new Director of Alumni Engagement, Savino will be directly involved in creating new strategies to increase participation in alumni events. She will work closely with Head of School John Palfrey and Thomas Lockerby, the Secretary of the Academy, to get more alumni involved both on and off campus.\n“We will be looking at two buckets or focuses of programming. One will be alumni programming ‘on the hill’ and then alumni programming ‘off the hill’: bringing alumni back to campus and how we connect them to each other or to the school off the campus,” said Savino.\n“My job here is not about my experiences… [it] is about all of the… alumni experiences and connecting them from those experiences to the school,” she continued.\nSavino began working at Andover in October 2002. During her first few years at Andover, Savino spearheaded the Young Alumni Program on campus, which aims to keep young alumni connected to the school upon their graduation.\nAfter four years of working as the Assistant Director of Alumni Engagement, Savino became the Associate Director, where she organized over 160 alumni events each year including the regional and international gatherings based on affinity groups, The Phillipian, alumni veterans and Abbot Academy alumnae, among others.\n“At this point after this many years, I’ve done a little bit of everything and did a lot of programming—both general programming for alumni and then class-specific and other demographic-specific programming,” said Savino.\nAmong the numerous tasks at the Alumni Engagement Office, Savino especially enjoyed learning and hearing the unique stories that each Andover graduate shared with her.\n“The number one thing about working with alumni is learning their Andover stories. They all had different paths going through here,” said Savino.\nAs a graduate of Lawrenceville, Savino admitted that the prospect of working at a school she did not attend initially seemed daunting. She said, however, that her experiences at Lawrenceville have helped her empathize with Andover students, faculty and alumni.\n“[Savino] has been an effective, hard-working manager of a wide range of alumni programs who works smoothly with faculty, administrators and staff here on campus. She is well-liked and respected by alumni of all ages, who enjoy her outgoing personality and personal charm. Particularly since she has been Associate Director, she has shown sound, mature judgement in working with our wide-ranging constituencies,” said Dick Howe, another Associate Director of Alumni Engagement.\nOne of Savino’s long-term goals as the new Director is to bring greater awareness to current students and faculty about Andover’s alumni network, as well as strengthen the existing relationship between the school and its alumni.\n“I would love for students and faculty to feel a direct connection or the ability to connect with alumni,” Savino said. “You don’t have to be an alumnus to connect with the alumni community.”\nFurthermore, Savino hopes that stronger alumni connections and communities will be formed and that more alumni will share their personal Andover stories with each other.\n“I am looking forward to working on a strategy that promotes lifetime engagement for our alumni. This entails expanding the connections across our alumni [network] with different programs at different points in their adult life… with these treasured partnerships, we will develop a program that connects the students to alumni, alumni to alumni and alumni to the school,” wrote Savino in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nWhen she stepped onto the Andover campus in 1980, Kathleen Dalton, Instructor in History and Social Science, immediately made it her priority to address the issue of gender inequality. She fought to install the first gender studies course and lobbied for the recruitment of more female teachers. Her husband, Tony Rotundo, a former Instructor of History and Social Science, had a crucial role in the formation of the Office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), serving as Associate Dean in the early 1990s. This Friday, both Dalton and Rotundo are receiving the 2015 McKeen Award for their dedication to improving the climate of gender within the Andover community.\nThe McKeen Award, created in 1998 by the Brace Center for Gender Studies, honors members of Phillips Academy who have worked diligently toward eliminating social and institutional barriers within the student and faculty bodies. The award is given in honor of previous Headmistress of Abbot Academy, Philena McKeen, in remembrance of her efforts to establish an academic community in which all young women could thrive.\n“We have been actively involved in all sorts of gender issues ever since we got to [Andover]… There are some very fundamental ways things have changed and I think students now take [that] for granted,” Dalton said.\nTogether, Dalton and Rotundo worked to make gender a bigger topic of discussion on campus. They helped to establish the Brace Center in 1996 and then served as co-directors for seven years.\n“We were both on the executive board of the Brace Center for pretty much all the years we weren’t directing it. At this point, that would be around 10-12 years,” said Rotundo.\nDalton arrived in 1980 and began her work assisting the recruitment of new faculty and achieving the school’s goal of equal gender representation.\n“It was largely a boys school that merged with Abbot Academy. So in the 70s, there were a lot of issues people had to work on in terms of girls’ bathrooms, overt sexism and spirit in terms of what kind of school we wanted to create… There were a lot of equity and inclusion issues that had to be addressed,” said Dalton.\nDalton described how shortly after merging with Abbot Academy in the 1970s, 60 percent of the student population was male and only 40 percent was female. The faculty was 75 percent male and 25 percent female.\n“I spoke with the trustees about why it was important to change the composition of the student body so that it was closer to equal… I helped to push the school to fire faculty who sexually harassed students… I lobbied the Head of School to do more hiring of women faculty,” said Dalton.\nIn addition to working with the trustees and the Head of School, Dalton worked closely with students to help empower women leaders. To do this, she collaborated with Rebecca Sykes, the 2014 recipient of the McKeen Award and Andover’s former Associate Head of School.\n“I assisted [Rebecca Sykes] in her guidance of the Girls’ Leadership Project. We worked with a really outstanding group of girls thinking about running for office on campus and trying for different kinds of leadership roles and taking themselves seriously,” said Dalton.\nAlongside Dalton, Rotundo was involved in the establishment and improvement of CAMD at Andover. He worked closely with members of the school community to discuss gender in combination with race, class and sexual orientation.\n“I worked on an educational program for the faculty about transgender [issues]… I worked with groups of boys and male faculty, trying to improve the climate of gender from the direction of male students and teachers,” said Rotundo.\nOutside his work at Andover, Rotundo studied the history of gender in great depth, compiling his research into his book, “American Manhood: Transitions in Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era.”\n“My academic work was about [the] history of manhood, particularly white manhood in the United States. I helped to create what is now considered a significant subfield of history and in particular, gender history,” said Rotundo.\nDalton and Rotundo’s work has been significant within the Andover community, igniting numerous conversations surrounding sexuality and gender roles.\n“There is a much greater awareness of gender issues and how they affects our female students, our male students, our transgender students, even our faculty as well… There’s also a much greater awareness of the intersection of gender with race, class [and] sexuality,” said Rotundo.\n“Finally, we have a lot of really good courses that deal with gender… I think a whole lot more people are discussing gender so we are delighted that it has turned out this way because it could have gone backward,” said Dalton.\nDespite the positive changes that have been made in the Andover community, Dalton and Rotundo believe there is still room for improvement.\n“I think we need to do a lot of work about sexual decision making and hook-up culture; there is a lot of pressure to be sexually active before kids are really ready. I [also] think people still have the male model as the model of leadership… I think a lot of kids are very traditional in their attitudes towards gender,” said Dalton.\n“There is a percentage of the faculty who might not have ever thought about gender. This is an issue because there are a variety of kids on campus who think about gender a lot and are either trying to come to terms with their sexual identities or questioning very traditional pressures,” said Rotundo.\nRotundo started his teaching career here at Andover in 1981 and retired in 2014. Dalton is soon to follow in his footsteps; having taught here since 1980. She plans to retire at the end of this academic year.\n“They are academic giants, and they were bringing particular kinds of expertise to the school. I worry about what kind of institutional memory is lost when these two leave…They are scholars, they are friends, they are intellectuals. It’s a great loss,” said Tasha Hawthorne, Instructor in English and Co-Director of the Brace Center, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nDalton and Rotundo will be presented their award on Friday, November 13 in Davis Hall on the Abbot campus.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nMembers of the Board of Trustees and the Alumni Council experienced the whirlwind of projects and initiatives that make up the strategic plan during the Fall Trustee gathering last weekend. Nearly 250 alumni leaders participated in presentations covering each of the three missions of the strategic plan: “Equity and Inclusion,” “Empathy and Balance” and “Creativity and Innovation” between November 5 and 6.\nWalking through the newly constructed Sykes Wellness Center on a tour led by Amy Patel, Medical Director, and Carol Israel, Director of Graham House Counseling Center, alumni guests and trustees said that they witnessed the transformation of the old Isham Health Center into a bright and welcoming new facility. The Wellness Center will open for use in late November.\nThe trustees also discussed the future of Andover’s Athletics Master Plan during a discussion led by Leon Modeste, Athletic Director, and architects from Perkins + Will. Modeste explained the four-phase mission of the plan, which includes new construction, renovation and expansion projects of the athletics facility. The fundraising effort of constructing a 96,000 square-foot field house has already begun, and the Board of Trustees will vote on whether to proceed with the plan at its spring meeting.\nTrustees also discussed plans for renovation included in the Campus Master Plan.\n“Topics included enlivening George Washington Hall as a more student-centered space, creating faculty residential neighborhoods, modernizing Oliver Wendell Holmes Library and Morse Hall, weaving sustainability throughout our planning and addressing safety concerns along Route 28,” according to a press release on Andover’s website.\nThe board is scheduled to vote on a final version of the plan at its winter meeting.\nParticipants of “Learning in the World” programs gave multimedia presentations for the trustees of Andover’s off-campus immersive learning opportunities, including Brazil PLACES, Niswarth and HUACA Project.\nThe student cast of Hairspray also welcomed the trustees with a performance of “You Can’t Stop the Beat” on Friday evening’s dinner, setting the stage for a night of celebration and appreciation. Board President Peter Currie ’74 opened the evening by commemorating former president David Underwood ’54 and Donna Brace Ogilvie ’30, founder of the Brace Center for Gender Studies, two esteemed benefactors of Andover who recently passed away. Currie also honored Dan Cunningham ’67, who recently concluded 15 years as a charter trustee. Cunningham’s work as a board member focused most notably on financial aid, according to the press release.\nThe evening closed with a brief award ceremony, during which Pat Farrell, Dean of Faculty, thanked the faculty recipients for their teaching and devotion to Andover.\n“We know that you stand for and you represent so many great instructors and so many great role models here on this faculty,” said Head of School John Palfrey at the dinner.\nSeveral positions were awarded during the weekend: the Donna Brace Ogilvie II Teaching Foundation to Elizabeth Aureden, Instructor in Music; the Harkness Instructorship to Nikki Cleare, Instructor in Math, Statistics and Computer Science; the Class of 1946 Teaching Foundation to Jerry Hagler, Instructor in Biology; and the Harris Family Instructorship to Thomas Kane, Instructor in English.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nAndover students and faculty assembled on Wednesday afternoon to recognize and honor veterans in observance of Veterans Day.\nFlag Flash Mob\nOn Wednesday afternoon, members of the Andover community gathered by the Vista Walk to carry a 30 by 50 foot United States flag to the Elson Courtyard. Once there, participants of the flash mob cheered the names of Andover veterans and snapped the flag in their honor.\n“It was really important for me to be out there… We have to recognize that these people have given so much for our country. It’s important to understand that and let them know that we are grateful for them,” said Sam Tobin ’18.\nAndover in the Military Dinner\nAndover students, faculty and alumni gathered during a dinner that night organized by the Andover and the Military group in celebration of Veterans Day to hear this year’s keynote speaker, Steve Abbot ’62, a retired four-star admiral in United States Navy.\nAbbot arrived at Andover in 1960 as an Upper and graduated in 1962. He proceeded to attend the United States Naval Academy and serve in the Navy from 1966 to 2000. In addition, he has worked with many organizations including the Department of Homeland Security and the Navy Marine Corporation Relief Society (NMCRS).\nIn his speech to the Andover community, Abbot reflected on the impact that Andover has had on his life.\n“Academically, [Andover] was such a good preparation for the rest of my life. It was the place where I learned how to read and write. I was made to learn how to absorb a whole lot of material quickly and to answer questions the way they were asked,” said Abbot in an interview with The Phillipian.\nOne course that Abbot found particularly useful was the United States history class he took as a Senior with Miles Malone, former Instructor in History.\n“If you take a look at [United States] history, in some depth, perhaps sometimes contemporary events don’t seem so unusual when you realize that the country’s been functioning under the same, essentially, federal system. The study of it helps [me] understand contemporary events,” said Abbot.\nAbbot also touched upon the meaning of two of Andover’s mottos,“finis origine pendet” and Non Sibi.\n“[Finis origine pendet] basically says to me that the end depends on the beginning, and what I think that means is that if you had the good fortune to be a student at Andover, you’re going to have the opportunity for the good start that will determine the good ending,” said Abbot.\nSpeaking to the Andover community, Abbot expressed his opinion on how the nation reaches out to veterans in need outside of Veteran’s Day.\n“You might ask, ‘How might the country be doing for veterans for the other 364 days of the year?’ And actually, I think that the country is doing better,” said Abbot. “[For veterans] there are scars that still exist. But I see an enormous outpouring for veterans in the country. There are major efforts in many places [to] find employment for veterans and mentor them to achieve the skills that they need to enter the workforce.”\nDespite the progress the United States has made as a whole, however, Abbot still believes that there is a lot more work to be done.\n“There are statistics that are less encouraging. For instance, the suicide rate among veterans is higher than… the national average,” said Abbot.\nAbbot also emphasized his work in the Navy Marine Corporation Relief Society (NMCRS). The NMCRS provides nurses who make home visits to wounded and injured veterans.\n“I think, as many of you know, some of the problems veterans experience after combat are latent… We follow these wounded marines and sailors until they tell us that they don’t need us anymore,” said Abbot.\nEvery year since 2009, the Andover community and the Andover in the Military Committee has held a Veteran’s Day dinner to remember the veterans that served the country and to stimulate discussions about the military’s history and mission as well as their activities.\n“We all learned about Non Sibi when we were at this school. And, being part of our bloodline, we graduated and moved [on] to other schools and other pursuits, but that Non Sibi spirit remained with us… the military service that most of us went into is the definition of Non Sibi on a daily basis,” said Charles Dean ’79, the Chair of Andover and the Military, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nOther speakers for the event included Laurie Coffey ’95 and Jim Connelly ’82.\nIn the spirit of commemorating veterans, Andover also plans to memorialize the 700 Andover alumni who fought in the Civil War.\n“The timing is right for us to figure this out… We had begun a conversation this spring [and] we look forward to engaging you all students and faculty in a conversation about how best to do that,” said Head of School John Palfrey during the Veterans Day dinner.\nNext Monday, there will be a recognition ceremony on campus for Tom Hudner ’43, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in the Korean War.\nCupcakes\nDuring dinner, 1000 cupcakes were frosted in red, white and blue icing and arranged in the shape of a flag of the United States to celebrate Veterans Day. These cupcakes were displayed in Paresky Commons and were made available to the Andover community.\n“Hall of Names”\nNames of faculty and staff who are veterans were displayed on the LED screen in Paresky Commons as a display of gratitude. There are 20 names in all.\nCard Writing Extravaganza\nDuring dinner, students and faculty were encouraged to send a quick message to Alexandra Bell ’13 and Taylor Perkins ’12, two Andover alumni currently enrolled atin military academies.\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2015'), ('\nAfter analyzing responses to the survey she sent to Andover students this past summer, Sadie Holmes ’16 noticed a disparity between girls and boys in the fields of science, technology, math and science (STEM). As one of the four Brace Center for Gender Studies fellows, Holmes addressed the role of gender in STEM fields in her presentation, “Women in STEM: Why So Few?” last Monday.\nAs a student passionate about STEM, Holmes explored the origins of gender gaps in STEM from early childhood, throughout women’s educational journeys and into their experiences in the workforce.\n“The experience of girls in STEM here at Andover is truly a fortunate one. For the most part, we have a very accepting community that encourages girls to pursue what they want. However, there are very subtle undertones of discrimination and unfairness in math and science classes,” said Holmes during her presentation.\nShe continued, “I’m hopeful that as our community learns about subtle bias and discrimination against girls who are not only pursuing STEM but are doing any number of things, girls will feel more confident in their abilities and more empowered to pursue STEM in college and beyond.”\nIn her presentation, Holmes discussed how Andover can support the academic careers of women in STEM, arguing that the school must provide the resources and mentorship in its educational settings to ensure that women can achieve growth and satisfaction in their professional lives.\n“Getting girls interested in STEM is hard. It takes both a cultural shift to appreciate and celebrating girls who pursue STEM at any level and a systemic shift that ensures girls are getting the support they need,” said Holmes.\nHolmes was first inspired to pursue her interest in the lack of women in STEM after she took Biology 580 as an Upper.\n“I’ve always loved math and science and the challenges they provided with me. After talking with my incredible [biology] teacher [Catherine] Kemp, who told me about how she left research to become a teacher because she feared she wouldn’t be able to have a child and keep up with her work, I began to wonder what the experience of a woman in higher levels of STEM would be like,” wrote Holmes in an email to The Phillipian.\nHolmes found that one solution to the gender gap in STEM might be creating more engaging beginner level science and math classes at Andover through group projects and student collaboration. In addition, she found the need for more female role models and a stronger mentorship system in STEM.\n“We should have a stronger mentorship system, whether that be a formal one that pairs younger girls seeking tutors with older girls who will not only tutor them but also mentor them and be friends with them, or an informal one where teachers build stronger relationships with their students and seek to provide constructive feedback that would allow them to improve their skills,” said Holmes.\nHolmes found the most important factor in the gender gaps in STEM fields is the lack of awareness about this problem.\n“Something that shocked me as I was writing this paper was how few people even realized this might be a problem at Andover and beyond… I hope with this project I’ve spread some awareness of the expanse of the problem and have incited some people to think different about STEM at Andover and what we can do to encourage girls to pursue STEM,” said Holmes.\nHolmes’s faculty advisor, Dr. Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology, pitched ideas for her research and provided her with constructive criticism. “[Holmes] was very well prepared, very well researched and I love that she had her own study and her own research through the survey. [Holmes] brought back… her project to Andover by having ideas and potential solutions for increasing the confidence and support of girls taking STEM classes,” said Marshall-Walker in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe Brace Center is an academic resource center where students and faculty work together on gender based research projects.\n\n', 'Nov 9, 2015'), ('\nMichael Chu was inspired to delve into stocks and finance when after graduating college he met an American graduate student working on Wall Street. Now, as Senior Lecturer of Business Administrations at Harvard University, he is regarded as a leader in microfinance.\nChu, who was invited to campus by the Philanthropy and Investing Club, outlined the impacts individuals can make in underdeveloped countries through microfinance during his presentation, entitled “Changing the World: In Search of Effective Solutions – A Personal Journey.” He gave his presentation Thursday, October 29th in Kemper Auditorium.\nAlthough Michael Chu was born in China, he grew up in Montevideo, Uruguay, where first discovered his yearning to help others.\n“[At my school in Montevideo], they made us run around the perimeter of the campus,” said Chu during a presentation in Kemper Auditorium last Thursday. “On one side, it was the playing fields [but] on the other side, I saw a lot of pretty shabby houses with people that weren’t that well dressed… at that time, what I was seeing caused enough of an impression that the seeds of wanting to participate in social change were embedded in me.”\nAfter graduating from Dartmouth College in 1968, Chu took a gap year during which he returned to Montevideo. During this time, he became involved in the country’s changing political environment and became a member of the opposition party, the National Party of Uruguay.\n“I had the best of intentions, and I thought change must come when people like me would be in government, because then we would make all the changes necessary for a more equitable world… What I later realized was that best of intentions did not mean best of results,” said Chu during his presentation.\nWhen Chu first joined the opposition party he was not interested in economics or microfinance. Chu soon discovered that profit could be used to help the less fortunate and thus decided to further pursue his passion for microfinance at Harvard Business School.\nNow a Senior Lecturer of Business Administration and co-chair of the Strategic Leadership for Inclusive Finance at Harvard Business School, Chu helps encourage and fund individuals willing to make a positive impact on the world and the lives of people living in less developed countries.\n“I hope to [change the world] by supporting and creating enterprises that are very profitable, delivering interventions that will make a big difference in people being able to realize their potential. So it’s a venture capital for a more equitable world,” said Chu in an interview with The Phillipian.\nChu’s presentation was followed by a question and answer session, during which he fielded questions from the audience. During the session, Chu addressed the effect of modern technology on the microfinance industry.\n“I think the model that dominates modern microfinance is a 30 year old model. Any 30 year old model, especially in 2015, is ripe for disruption… and I think that technology is really going to disrupt [microfinance],” he said.\nChu said that he hoped to emphasize the importance of critical thinking through his presentation.\n“I think the most effective thing is really being a deep thinker in the sense that you don’t accept conventional concepts without thinking them through. I think that would be really powerful in anything, but also in finance,” said Chu.\nMustafa Masud ’16, Co-Head of Philanthropy and Investing Club, said that the club brought Chu to campus not only because of his background in microfinance, but also because his work reflects Andover’s motto of Non Sibi.\n“Chu’s presentation [was] powerful in that it provided an easy to understand description of how microfinance works, why it is sustainable and how it allows individuals interested in finance to engage in global community enrichment. It was also a well-told personal story of his childhood and the college process, which the students receiving the presentation could relate to,” wrote Masud in an email to The Phillipian.\nIn addition to his work in the microfinance sector, Chu is also the head of Project Antares, a program dedicated to providing high quality healthcare to low income populations. He is also the Managing Director of the IGNIA fund, which strives to serve low-income populations in Mexico.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2015'), ('\nWhile interning at a French consulate in Chicago during the past two summers, Carson Wardell ’16 interacted with Moroccans in France, hearing firsthand the hardships these immigrants faced in France. Inspired by these interactions, Wardell decided to further explore the roots of Islamophobia in France and its contributions to the continuation of Islamic fundamentalism.\nStanding before a full audience in Kemper Auditorium last Friday night, Carson Wardell ’16, one of this year’s Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholars, shared his research exploring the role that French ideologies held in shaping the French-Muslim experience in his presentation titled “The Rise of Islamophobia and the Integration of Muslims in France.”\nWardell found universalism, a belief in a singular French identity, to be one of the main reasons for Islamophobia in France.\n“[Universalism is] the belief in the abstract citizen… That’s to say that the French people are regarded as singular and universal in their identity. Universalism, then, can be broadly categorized as the profound fear of and the reluctance to accept difference,” said Wardell during his presentation. “The problem lies in the fact that Maghrebi Muslims don’t blend in or assimilate as easily as other immigrants in France because of their religious and cultural differences. Thus, universalist integration singles out and marginalizes Muslims, which fosters an islamophobic culture,” wrote Carson in an email to The Phillipian.\nClaire Gallou, Instructor in French and CAMD faculty advisor to Wardell, hoped to further the discussion of French multiculturalism that ensued following “#jesuischarlie,” a Commentary article she wrote that was published in The Phillipian on January 16, 2015. “I was eager to somehow continue the discussion, wrestle with contradictions raised by [the terrorist attacks in Paris last January] and find a way to expose thoroughly and as neutrally as possible the difficulties that a very old country such as a France encounters when it comes to multiculturalism. I was interested in linking this topic to multiculturalism and integration in the U.S. and on our campus. [Wardell] gave me the key,” said Gallou in her introduction of Wardell.\nOne main aspect of universalism is the idea of “laïcité.” One France’s founding principles, “laïcité” is defined as especially strict secularism, the principle of the separation of government from religious institutions.\n“To conflate [laïcité] with our American version of secularism doesn’t grasp how strict [it] is. The whole idea of pledging to one nation under God under laïcité principles would be absurd. It would be completely ridiculous. It is a much stronger and much more absolute interpretation of secularism. It can be traced back to hundreds of years of the Catholic church controlling the views and using the French government,” said Wardell.\nWardell found that the French-universalism expectations play a key role in Muslim immigration in France.\n“France places really high demands on its immigrants. It places really high demands on them to adopt a national identity, to become French [and] to adopt French cultural norms,” he said.\nFollowing the presentation, Wardell invited a group of students up to the stage to share and discuss their experiences as Muslim students at Andover. “When I first came to Andover, I was really happy to see that there were a lot of people that were really understanding of my faith and my culture. For instance, my house counselor would tell me that there would be a fire drill so I could cover up before it happened, and even my cross country coach told me I could be a little late sometimes if I had to pray before practice… I was really happy to see these kinds of people here,” said Zahra Marhoon ’17 during the panel.\nNadha Illikkal ’17 shared that while she thinks Andover is tolerant and accepting of Islam, she is disappointed that Andover does not actively help her continue her practice of Islam on campus.\n“It was a struggle at first to find time to do all of these [Islam] practices because [although] everyone [at Andover] is very accommodating… a lot of the time I found that I had to go out and ask for help to continue these practices rather than them doing that to me. I felt that that was one of the hardest things for me, and my [Junior] year… those five minute breaks when all of my friends thought I was going to go to the bathroom were actually to go pray in the corner of the library. I think that part of the problem was me being afraid of those around me and also Andover not openly helping students continue their religious practices,” said Illikkal.\nIn looking at the example of France, Wardell said he hopes his presentation will inspire dialogue on the value of multiculturalism at Andover. “I think most students here accept diversity. However, they don’t consider what comes next. They are content with looking past difference and I think that’s the dominant culture [at Andover]. I hope my talk challenged that paradigm and got people to think about why looking past and ignoring difference doesn’t work,” said Wardell.\nSponsored by the Office of Community & Multicultural Development, the CAMD Scholar program, established in 2006, allows selected students to pursue independent summer research projects related to diversity, multiculturalism, community or identity under the guidance of a faculty advisor.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2015'), ('\nWith three of Andover’s most distinguished alumni seated on the stage during Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM) to accept the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction, students and faculty soaked in their inspiring stories and advice.\nEach year since 2012, the Andover Alumni Council has recognized graduates of Andover or Abbot Academy who have achieved great success in their fields of endeavor with the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction. The award acknowledges the recipient’s impressive accomplishments and honors their successful lives that began at Andover.\nThe Alumni Council presents the awards at the recommendation of Andover alumni. This year’s recipients of the award were Maro Chermayeff ’80, Tracy Kidder ’63, Marvin Minsky ’45 and Julia Alvarez ’67, who visited Andover for the Youth from Every Quarter ASM last week. The theme of this week’s ASM was “Finis Origine Pendet,” one of Andover’s mottos, which means “the end depends upon the beginning.”\nAward recipients attended a celebratory dinner the Tuesday before ASM in the Mural Room. Alumni, faculty and students gathered to honor the recipients’ extraordinary achievements. After ASM, students were invited to a Q&A session with the recipients in the Mural Room.\nMaro Chermayeff\nWhile many of her classmates struggled to discover new talents and dreams during their time at Andover, Maro Chermayeff ’80 was a cinema buff since childhood. Chermayeff loved shooting short experimental films with her friends and dreamed of a career in the cinema industry.\n“I think [at Andover] I was thinking about the fundamentals that built my interest, rather than focusing on what my career would be… I always knew that I was going to be in the film business,” Chermayeff said during an interview with The Phillipian. “It was [more about] how I [was] going to do it. I pretty much decided here and through college that I wanted to do documentary. I really wanted to tell a true voice.”\nAfter 35 illustrious years in the film industry, Chermayeff’s works have garnered widespread critical acclaim. She received an Emmy Award for her film, “Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present,” which she co-produced with her partner, Jeff Dupree.\nAdditionally, as the president and cofounder of “Show of Force,” an organization that creates innovative documentaries and broadcasts, Chermayeff has created numerous television series and films that aim to shed light on significant social issues, including human trafficking and women’s rights.\n“What really brought me [into documentary] was a sense of a moral conscience taking me down a path of looking at how can I take the things that I care about, the things that are important to me, the talents that I have in my chosen field… how can I take those interests and channel them into issues in great need of a voice,” said Chermayeff during her speech at ASM.\nChermayeff’s passion for filmmaking that she cultivated at Andover has remained strong throughout her decades of work. “Every film is like a new Master’s degree… Every time, you’re starting again,” said Chermayeff. “I’m not sure that I would do well if I was an accountant, if I were doing the same thing all the time. I like to constantly change it up. It’s always the same medium, the story of film and media… but I get tired if it doesn’t change up all the time. One day I’m doing music and one day it’s about organ transplantation.”\nLooking back at her time in high school, Chermayeff remembers Andover as a place of new beginnings and a starting line to her career in film as well as her social and personal development.\n“There are a lot of firsts [at Andover] when you’re young… For so many people, it’s the first time they’re away from home, the first time they fall in love, the first time you have a mentor, the first time you fail,” said Chermayeff.\nChermayeff hopes she inspires current Andover students to use their talent in the field of their choice to make a difference in the world. “Helping people to find their passion, and then realize how they can turn that into something that’s lifelong for them, is very important to me,” said Chermayeff.\n“Seize the things you want to do with your life, and take in all that they have to offer. Other people on the other end are going to be benefitted, but the person that’s going to benefit the most is yourself,” said Chermayeff during her speech at ASM.\nTracy Kidder\nTracy Kidder ’63 initially began writing during college to impress girls in his class. Not too long after, though, writing became one of his greatest passions, leading Kidder to a distinguished career as a journalist, novelist and writer.\n“My mother was a high school English teacher, and she always read to me and my brothers. When I got to Harvard, I took a course in creative writing for the fun of it, and the instructor seemed to like some of the stuff that I wrote. But I think that my first strong impulse to become a writer was that it seemed like a way to meet and impress girls,” said Kidder during an interview with The Phillipian.\nAfter earning a BA from Harvard College, Kidder served as a lieutenant in the Vietnam War, then proceeded to attend the renowned Writers’ Workshop at the University of Iowa, where he earned his MFA. His many novels, including “The Soul of a New Machine” and “Among the Schoolchildren,” have earned him a Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Award, among other accolades.\nKidder said he considers his 2003 book “Mountains Beyond Mountains,” a nonfiction biography recounting the work of Paul Farmer, a doctor who worked in Haiti to help fight tuberculosis and AIDS, his favorite piece of writing.\n“I was handed a very interesting story, at a time when I still had a lot of energy and was probably as good a writer as I was ever going to be,” said Kidder. “I didn’t write that book to do a good deed. I just had a good story and wanted to tell it as well as I could.”\nKidder’s time at Andover heavily impacted his development as a writer. He credits his Andover education for his strong foundations in writing that have fueled his work.\n“I hadn’t done any [writing] until I got here. I went to public school through eighth grade. I remember having to write an essay in eighth grade, and as I recall, what you were supposed to do was to copy something from the encyclopedia… [Andover was] where I found that I had to learn how to write,” said Kidder.\nKidder recalled memories of Fred Peterson, an influential English teacher he had during his time at Andover, and thanked him for instilling in him a deep knowledge of poetry and making him memorize poems that he still remembers even to this day.\n“I had this strange English teacher who we used to make fun of… In retrospect, I loved the man… He was a lot smarter than he wanted us to realize. He had us memorize poetry, and I still have, rattling around in my head, great gouts of Shakespeare… [Something] I’ve done all my life since then is memorize poems. Somehow, it seems really important to me… memorizing great pieces of language and having them in your head. It’s a resource you have in there to call on in some way,” he said.\nNow, Kidder is recognized as a leading literary journalists and is known for his powerful personal voice in his writing. His most recent book “Good Prose: The Art of Nonfiction” serves as a guide to nonfiction writing for individuals of various literary levels.\nMarvin Minsky Marvin Minsky ’45 developed a love for robotics and technology at a young age – he was often played with Tinkertoys and Lincoln Logs. He is now widely acknowledged as one of the world’s first leaders in the development of artificial intelligence and has made a number of significant contributions in the fields of robotics, cognitive psychology and mathematics.\nOnce Minsky graduated from Andover, he served in the Navy for a few months and was stationed in Florida. As World War II came to an end, Minsky returned to his studies and attended Harvard University for his college education.\n“At college, I had a great time. I worked with the best scientists of the era, so I was in heaven for many years and anything I wanted to do, somebody would help get it done,” said Minsky during an interview with The Phillipian.\nAfter receiving his BA degree in mathematics and PhD from Harvard and Princeton, respectively, Minsky went on to become a professor at Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT). There, he encouraged his students to speak up in class and follow their natural instincts and interests.\n“They should ignore all advice and do the smart thing. They should say you’re wrong and give a reason,” said Minsky.\nIn 1951, Minsky built the Stochastic Neural-Analog Reinforcement Computer, the world’s first neural network simulator. Five years later, he designed and built the first Confocal Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument with remarkable image quality and resolution for its time.\nDespite his expertise in the field of artificial intelligence, Minsky was unsure of what to expect as the next big innovation in his field. “There is no particular country or agency doing very well in [the area of artificial intelligence], so it might come from anywhere, from some kids somewhere in some country. [They] might be the big next step,” said Minsky.\nMinsky was also one of the co-founders of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. In 1985, he became a founding member of the MIT Media Lab and was named the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences.\nMinsky expressed gratitude for the ample opportunities and resources Andover presented, particularly in the field of mathematics and psychology. He also thanked the teachers that inspired and helped him with any experiments that he wished to pursue.\n“If I wanted to do something, I would ask the right person. It was quite remarkable… The secret of getting somewhere [was] to be protegee of someone more powerful,” said Minsky.\nMinsky’s contributions to the fields of cognitive psychology, mathematics, computational linguistics, robotics and optics have led him to receive a number of other prestigious distinctions, including the ACM Turing Award, IJCAI Award for Research Excellence, Japan Prize and Benjamin Franklin Medal.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2015'), ('\nDivided into three separate groups named after ice cream flavors — chocolate, vanilla and strawberry—students were instructed to create the best hypothetical school possible with the resources allocated to them. As the game progressed and the competition intensified, the differences between each group slowly unravelled, revealing that the vanilla group had received an unlimited supply of play money and space in Kemper Auditorium to plan their school, the strawberry group received an average amount, and the chocolate group had the least. Eventually, the game reached a point where the vanilla group’s school underwent rapid advancement, having a school with 16 classrooms while the chocolate group’s school only had one classroom.\nAvery Kim ’17 said that students realized how the exercise demonstrated how classism effects different social groups and gives one class more privilege than the others. This game was one of numerous activities in which students partook during the Social Justice Leadership Institute.\n75 students dedicated to social justice from ten peer schools arrived on campus on Saturday, October 30, and stayed until the evening of Sunday, November 1, for the Social Justice Institute. At the conference, students of various races, classes, genders and sexual orientations participated in workshops and exercises, all of which encouraged them to speak up about their experiences with identity.\nThis year marks the Social Justice Leadership Conference’s second year. The conference was facilitated by the Social Justice Institute, a joint collaboration between Andover and the Boston Mobilization organization, started several years ago during the making of the book, “Out of the Blue.” The book is a collection of anonymous stories from Andover students, all of which address one of seven themes regarding identity: class, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, geographic origin and ability.\nDuring the conference, students focused on different types of social inequality like sexism, racism and classism, as well as the ways these inequalities intersect and how students can promote discussion and change in their environments. All 75 students stayed overnight on campus—students who identify as male slept in Kemper Auditorium and those who identify as female slept in the Abbot School Room.\nLinda Carter Griffith, Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion, said “There is the education that comes with [the activities], but [the program is] also about being equipped to be an upstander in your own school communities, to help positive change happen in the cultures in our schools.”\nSydney Olney ’17 found the ice cream game the most insightful activity in which she participated.\n“I was in the chocolate group and at first we were trying to reason with the school board, which [was] being played by the facilitators and they kept on taking out our people and putting them in jail, because we were walking without police escorts,” said Olney.\n“I don’t come from a specific background where I am really aware of other people’s privilege so this was like a really eye opening kind of activity,” Olney continued.\nFor Jungwoo Park ’19, the most powerful activity was the “gender walk,” an activity in which students would stand in a circle and listen to facilitators read various statements aloud. When students identified with a statement, they took a step further into the circle.\n“At the end, all the cis males were at the middle of the room and all the women were at the outside, and all the non-conforming folks were at the very edge. Once it was revealed to me it was quite obvious that was true. Unless I was really looking for it, I would not have been able to see those things,” said Park.\n“I come from a pretty sheltered and conservative town where things such as gender, race, sexuality and class aren’t really talked about and conversations about them are pretty frowned upon so I felt like I was pretty ignorant before coming here. I really appreciate the kind of knowledge and the experience that I have been able to gain,” he added.\nPark also found the conference’s collaboration with other schools as a great way to develop a deeper understanding of the topics discussed over the weekend.\n“I think it is wonderful because there is only so much that can be learned and experienced from one school. I think it is great how this program is bringing together people from all around the world,” said Park.\nCindy Espinosa ’18 thought the conference was an emotional experience in general.\n“I definitely had no idea about what I was getting myself into because… it was actually an emotional whirl throughout the experience, and it opened up my eyes to institutional issues involving race, gender that I hadn’t delved into thinking about,” said Espinosa.\n“Some of [the stories] were really personal… [students] talked about assault and catcalling as an example of violence and at the conference, everybody was connecting with their own experiences. I found solidarity with these people,” she continued.\nStudents from ten schools attended the conference, including students from Phillips Exeter Academy, Choate, Northfield Mount Hermon, Putney School, Cushing, Brooks, Concord Academy and St. Paul’s. 21 students from Andover joined the conference.\nGriffith hopes that students that participated in the conference will impart with the knowledge learned from the weekend and use it to create change.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2015'), ('\n“This is an opportunity to have FUN and be SPIRITED – it is not an invitation to be hurtful, insensitive, ignorant and/or offensive,” wrote Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, in an email to the student body last Tuesday about dressing appropriately for the upcoming Halloween activities.\nIn the email, Elliot attached a flowchart to help guide students in choosing Halloween attire. The flowchart touched upon issues such as cultural appropriation and costumes’ sex appeal.\nCreated by St. Luke’s School, a grade five through 12 school in New Canaan, CT., the flowchart included different questions that could potentially arise from a Halloween costume, such as “Is my costume supposed to be funny?” and “Does my costume represent a culture that is not my own?” Viewers of the flowchart can respond either “yes” or “no” and proceed to the next question.\nElliott’s use of the flowchart sparked discussion on campus and on social media by students and recent alumni. For instance, Alejandra Uría ’15 posted the flowchart on Facebook on Wednesday, garnering over 100 responses from Andover students and alumni. The topic of conversation focused mainly on the ideas of freedom of expression and sexism.\n“I think that [the email] was low-key for the females, and how they shouldn’t dress up inappropriately in short tight clothes, but people often dress like that anyways. I think it was really aimed towards the females,” said Melanie Tlasca ’19 in an interview.\n“I don’t think it was necessarily aimed at a specific group. If we’re being honest, people of any gender or sexual orientation can do anything that’s on this list that’s not okay. I don’t think it was necessarily aimed at a specific type of person or specific group, or a certain affiliation. I think the email was appropriate, necessary, well-worded and well-put-together. [Elliott] clearly put thought into it before she sent it, and I think it was very well-done – and needed,” said Moyo Oyebode ’18.\nElliott said in an interview with The Phillipian that the intent of her email was to remind students to be thoughtful with their attire as they went into the dance.\n“There’s no part of me that’s trying to ‘eek’ any fun out of Halloween, but rather to say I really just want to help kids make good choices so that Saturday night is a fun night and not something that they have regrets or second thoughts about after,” she said.\nElliott continued, “The flowchart that was attached was in no way meant to be directive, and it certainly was not from [Andover]. It was clearly marked as a different school. It’s a school that has a much wider age range of students, so there’s references to younger students that don’t apply to our kids, although I would offer that there are younger kids on campus, whether that’s for Abbotween or [the dance on] Saturday night, just to be thoughtful about our whole community.”\nA lot of discussion focused on the flowchart’s use of the phrase “cute and sassy instead of sexy and trashy” with regards to costume choices.\n“ ‘Sexy’ is a term that you feel, you’re owning that. That has to do with how you feel about what you’re doing or wearing, as opposed to the idea of looking sexy, which implies that someone else is determining how you look, determining how you’re trying to look. I think that’s a really critical distinction to make. [A] student brought to my attention yesterday her real concern that, in that chart, ‘sexy and trashy’ were coupled together. I think that’s an awesome observation to make and to dig into and think about, and how those two terms can be hugely gendered,” said Elliott.\nThe flowchart also addressed the danger of cultural appropriation, asking “Does my costume reduce cultural differences to a stereotype?” If viewers respond with a “yes,” the chart proceeds to warn them that their costume might be “xenophobic.”\n“I think it was a good way to ensure that no one appropriates culture during Halloween. I’m guessing they were trying to prevent people from doing something that could hurt someone else’s feelings. I personally didn’t think it was restrictive. It was a good effort on [Elliott’s] part to say that you can have fun but also be mindful of everyone else,” said Mofe Olarinmoye ’16.\nConversation regarding the email has encouraged students to delve deeper into the topics that the chart mentioned.\nTucker Drew ’17 said, “The chart seemed a little bit dismissive. I believe that the first step to getting across to a broader community is to understand why people want to dress the way they do and educate people. You can’t just say that it’s a bad thing. You have to educate them on why it is a bad thing.”\n“I welcome the conversation [about the flowchart]. I think sometimes kids get distracted by looking for ways that they administration is looking to wrong them, instead of thinking about potentially the ways that the administration or faculty members are trying to help them be thoughtful about what they’re doing,” said Elliott.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nNoticing the issues of transportation and scooter theft, the Makers’ Club decided to devise a plan for a campus-wide scooter rental initiative, said John Koobatian ’17, Co-President of the Makers’ Club.\n“We went through an ideation process asking ourselves what we saw as an issue on campus. Transportation came up again and again. Scooter theft was also a recurring problem,” said Koobatian.\nThe goal of the scooter initiative is to establish a system of Andover-specific scooters all over campus and allow students to rent them out at any time. The Makers’ Club is looking at previous systems such as Bluebike, which rented out bicycles to Andover students, and the Hubway system, which provides bicycles to its members through Hubway stations situated all over Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville.\n“People will be able to check out scooters as they check out library books,” said Koobatian. “There will be stations throughout campus where people can use their Blue Cards to grab scooters, and then they can return them to any other station within a set amount of time.”\nOnce implemented, this initiative will provide a faster and easier mode of transportation for students and reduce the risk of scooter theft. There has also been discussion regarding assigning a specific scooter to each student and offering either short-term or long-term rentals to students.\n“We hope that this new system will disincentivize scooter theft, for it will be just as easy to take a scooter for free than it would be to steal one,” said Koobatian.\nJared Zuker ’18 first proposed the idea for a scooter rental program. Eight students met in the Makerspace last Friday night to spend a few hours walking through the scooter initiative and all that it might entail, Koobation said.\nSome of the topics brought up during the meeting included possible locations to set up the stations, including Graves, Pine Knoll, the Andover Inn, Borden Memorial Gym Gym and the Quads, a locking mechanism at stations to further improve scooter security and a possible navigation system to track the positions of users.\nWhile scooter safety has been a part of the conversations regarding the new initiative, the Makers’ Club is optimistic that the new system will provide a safe, effective approach to dealing with scooter safety.\n“Safety is certainly something we took into account, and we do not foresee safety issues being a hindrance in the process,” said Koobatian. “Knowing systems like Bluebike are already in place on campus shows that this can be done safely.”\nThe scooter rental initiative is still in its prototyping stages and will be worked on extensively during Winter Term. The Makers’ Club hopes to solidify the ideas proposed during Friday’s meeting and further expand upon ways to improve the initiative by the end of winter term.\n“The planning is certainly not done yet. We are just entering the phase where we begin prototyping,” said Koobatian. “We intend to have a minimum viable product up and running by Spring Term of this year. The system should be opened to students soon after that.”\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nTugging on a blue leash, Eliza Sternlicht ’18 leads a dog on a peaceful walk around the 55-acre property. From the front of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (M.S.P.C.A.) Angell Animal Medical Center at Nevins Farm Animal Shelter, the atmosphere appears calm and tranquil, as visitors looking to adopt an animal interact with dogs, cats and birds in cages and glass pens.\nInside, however, the scene is hectic: staff members in blue shirts run around everywhere, some carrying beige cases with litters of kittens or scared dogs. Above the barks of the dogs, the hum from the industrial washing machines drones on. Gabriele Gucagaite ’17 offers spoonfuls of Meow Mix to a finicky cat named Neeley in between helping staff members do loads of laundry as staff members carry new animals in.\nFor the Andover students who volunteer there on Wednesday afternoons, common tasks include cleaning, feeding and playing with the shelter’s animals, which consists of cats, dogs, rabbits, donkeys, horses and pigs.\n“It seems like a lot of time, from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., but it really flies by. When you’re there, you’re not really thinking about homework or anything, you just focus on the animals,” said Ben Zhang ’17.\nGucagaite’s favorite part of M.S.P.C.A. is petting the cats after the chores are done.\n“We had this one cat, Neeley, and on the first day, she was so angry, [she was] trying to scratch our faces off whenever we would try to pass the cage! A few weeks later, she was the nicest cat ever! The change is really heartbreaking, in a good way,” said Gucagaite.\nBefore working with the animals, students are trained in areas like recording an animal’s behavior and their energy level and health.\n“Students who work with cats will make sure the cages are clean, make sure that the cage is in order or maybe even help brush the cat sometimes… they also have stables on the premises, so every now and than we have a student… helping clean the stable, and that is really hard work with a lot of shoveling,” said Chloe Epstein, Instructor in Mathematics and Statistics and a volunteer for the program.\nThe volunteers vary in their level of experience in working in animal shelters prior to working at the M.S.P.C.A. Some, like Zhang, had never worked at a shelter before.\n“I’ve never worked at a shelter before. I have a dog at home… so, I wouldn’t say I’m inexperienced with dogs, but I definitely wanted to work with animals,” said Zhang.\nOthers, like Sternlicht, have years of experience in working with animal shelters.\n“I worked at Greyhound Friends, Inc. for the past 6 years, and I have been all over the world working at animal rehabilitation veterinary clinics,” said Sternlicht.\n“Personally, I really love animals. I saw the M.S.P.C.A. as an opportunity to help better the lives of rescued animals, and contribute to society. It was a really great opportunity, honestly. Seeing the reaction that a dog will have after you take them for a walk is really amazing,” she added.\nOne of Sternlicht’s favorite parts of the program is seeing her favorite dog, Julian, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n“Seeing [Julian] and having his tail start wagging as he starts to get super excited and just seeing his reaction whenever I came near him, and him being able to become calm versus if he was barking at someone else is really rewarding,” she said.\n“I think that if you also really like animals the M.S.P.C.A is definitely the way to go because it is very hands-on, and you really do get to see the contributions that you are making,” she continued.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nBundled up in coats and jackets, families swarmed into the Smith Center on Friday night for the formal registration of Family Weekend. For many students and families, this weekend marked their first time reconvening since school started in September.\n“One of the things that I love to see is [while] just standing at the registration area, you can see the [students] walk in and their parents and kind of that first connection…you can actually see how much they [missed] each other,” said Karleigh Antista, Coordinator of Family Weekend and Coordinator of Alumni Engagement.\nMany programs were organized for families throughout the weekend. Family members had the opportunity to sit through their students’ classes, talk to teachers and go to a version of All School Meeting (ASM) in which Head of School John Palfrey gave a speech.\nFamily members could also attend special events such as Grasshopper Night, Music Department Concert, Dance Demonstration, as well as the first Andover’s Parents’ Book Club meeting, which was a new addition made by the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library to the program.\nFor Kenneth Masotti, father of Courtney Masotti ’17, going to his daughter’s classes and meeting with her teachers was his favorite part of the weekend. “They’re really all pretty amazing teachers, and hearing what the kids are doing, it frankly reminds me of college, one of my experiences—they’re that good,” said Masotti.\nTony Pagano, father of Alexa Pagano ’16, was also impressed by the college-like education students received at Andover.\n“I think that they do a wonderful job in coordinating many different parents and many different events… I don’t think there’s much that you can possibly improve, I mean, understanding that we’re on a high school campus, not a college campus. So, this is impressive on its own right,” said Tony Pagano. Pagano especially liked how families got to see the kind of learning environment their children were immersed in.\n“The moment that we all share together as parents to see our children in such a learning environment is kind of overwhelming in many cases. Especially for me since I’m a father of a Senior, to watch how fast four years went by and the experience that Alexa had actually received here, at [Andover], is overwhelming to all of us,” said Tony Pagano.\nDuring the book club meeting, families discussed the book “It’s Complicated” by Danah Boyd. The book was sent out to students’ families earlier this year and it focuses on topics such as identity, privacy, bullying and the digital lives of teenagers.\n“We shared the book with parents because we think it offers insights that help provide better understanding, and perhaps more importantly, mentorship in this new environment…and those parents now need the toolset to provide good counsel.” wrote Michael Barker, the Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services, in an email to The Phillipian.\nThis year’s changes featured new additions to the weekend, including the Tang Institute’s Open House and the registration office’s use of a new web-based registration system, Attend.com.\nAntista, despite being new to coordinating Family Weekend, found that this year’s events and feedback helped her get a better sense of the potential improvements she could make for next year’s events.\n“Our office has handled it for a long time, but this was kind of the first time I oversaw it. So I think we kept a lot of things pretty much the same and it gave me the opportunity to see and I’ll be able to go back and reevaluate, maybe make some changes for next year,” said Antista.\nThe planning for Family Weekend started in the summer. Coordinators communicated with faculty members to discuss potential programs that they could host, forming a preliminary schedule that was later revised as logistics were worked out.\n“[The planning was] busy… Adding that other layer onto the workload for everyone [was] a little challenging. But everyone [pulled] through and it [was] such a great weekend for the students the families, teachers, faculty and staff… Everyone kind of [came] together,” said Antista.\nNext year, Antista looks to adjust the structure of the weekend, refine the printed name tags and change the way student families receive information.\n“We may be looking into other ways to reach parents to make sure that everyone has the [weekend’s schedule] information before they arrive if they need. There are different ways that people hear about it through their students, but I think now I have better overview of the weekend and so I think we’ll be able to communicate the information a little differently,” said Antista.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nWith seasonal ingredients such as pumpkins, potatoes, carrots, cranberries and turkey, the chefs at Paresky Commons served a Farm to Fork dinner in celebration of National Food Day in the Smith Center last Friday.\nCelebrated nationwide to promote healthier and more sustainable eating, National Food Day features thousands of events around the country to help Americans enjoy higher quality food and push for reformed food policies.\nTo celebrate the day, a culinary team headed by Mike Giampa, Food Service Director and Paul Robarge, Senior Food Service Director, prepared a meal in hopes of exemplifying the purpose of National Food Day. The fall-themed menu featured ingredients sourced almost entirely from local vendors.\n“The meal was a fall theme because of the season but also because who doesn’t love a turkey dinner? It’s a classic meal that everybody seems to like and it was easy to serve in the Smith Center,” said Giampa.\nThe menu centered around classic fall ingredients. Dishes served include roasted turkey and squash, Thai pumpkin curry with jasmine rice, homemade stuffing and cranberry sauce.\n“The centerpiece was the turkey, we bought our turkeys from Raymond’s turkey farm. Everyone around here knows if you want fresh turkey, you go there. It’s local and it’s fresh, the turkeys were slaughtered the night before,” said Giampa.\nA significant amount of planning had to be done for Andover’s second annual Farm to Fork dinner, such as contacting vendors and sourcing all the ingredients from local farms.\n“When we had to place orders for everything most of the vendors already knew me. Last year was more difficult as it was the first time we had done this on such a massive scale but this time around we had already laid the groundwork. From here on out future events like this should be pretty easy,” said Giampa.\nOne of the challenges the culinary team faced in the planning process of the dinner was sourcing local produce. The problem with local vendors, according to Giampa, is that they sometimes can’t hold the sheer volume of produce needed by a large school such as Andover.\n“When we tried to get our potatoes from local vendors none of them had the quantity we needed so we eventually turned to a farm in Maine that could meet our demands,” said Giampa.\nAccording to Giampa, the meal turned out to be a success, with a huge turnout at the Smith Center.\n“My parents and I loved the Thanksgiving themed dinner on Friday night. It was a great way to catch up while eating comfort food. We had a great time, and my favorite dish was the stuffing,” said Mekedas Belayneh ’18.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nAmidst the hectic college application season, two founding members of the Thiel Fellowship, Danielle Strachman and Michael Gibson, encouraged students to follow their passions and not attempt to gain favor in the college admission process by forcing a fixed learning experience upon themselves.\nOn Tuesday night, Strachman and Gibson came to the Nest, formerly known as the Makerspace, to promote the pursuit of personal philanthropic, academic and cultural goals that may differ from most students’ educational path.\n“I think we live in a day and age where everything is focused on doing something because you need to get somewhere else…[but] focus on what you want to do and do a little bit at a time at whatever that project is… and keep developing it. It’s important,” said Strachman in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe Thiel Fellowship, a grant-making program designed to help foster innovation, was established by the Thiel Foundation. Annually, the fellowship gives out $100,000 to 20 individuals under 22 who desire to pursue a project about which they are passionate, rather than continuing in a traditional school. The purpose behind the fellowship is to show that there is more than just one path to success and to encourage self-directed learning, Strachman said.\nGibson and Strachman added that many students today participate in specific activities at their high schools to impress college admissions officers and do not to follow their own passions.\n“If there is something that you want to do and it is something that you’re passionate about, even if it doesn’t fit into homework or college applications or things that your parents want you to do, you [should] still carve out some time to do it because you don’t know where it will go,” said Strachman.\nThe money is distributed to selected students under one condition: diligence. While there are occasional check-ins to assess whether they fellows are actually achieving the goals they set for themselves, ultimately the program is all driven by self-motivated fellows.\nDuring the presentation, Gibson and Strachman shared the story of Max Lock, someone who started with nothing but an idea, as the paradigm of a diligent innovator.\nWhen Lock was 13, he started a business where he imported ice cream cones and cups from China and sold them to various buyers. Lock, however, found it difficult to negotiate prices with middlemen and was inspired to set up a platform similar to Yelp, which would allow small businesses to import directly from China.\nWith the help of the Thiel Fellowship, Lock was able to start up his own company called Fleet. Today, his company has 15 employees and is rapidly growing. Inspired by Lock’s success, Gibson and Strachman together founded an independent investment fund called the 1517 Fund. This organization invests between $1,000 and $500,000 in companies like Lock’s.\nAccording to Gibson and Strachman, the name is a historical reference to the Protestant Reformation and the protests against the Catholic Church selling indulgences, which were promised to help individuals enter Heaven, but became primarily a money-making scheme for the Church.\n“My favorite part about 1517 is that we can work with a broad range,” said Strachman. “So with our [1,000 dollar] grants, we can help someone who’s just getting started on something and it’s all new… and then we can help people all the way up to $500,000 … So, that, to me is really exciting: to be able to support people at multiple levels and not just one or the other.”\nStrachman and Gibson hope that their presentation will allow students to become more mindful when making big decisions such as deciding their majors, their colleges and what they want to achieve in life.\n“To have people comment and talk about not using that [college] path to get to what you want to be is very strange… even if you don’t use the fellowship or use 1517, the ideas that they have in their programs are really invaluable and can really help in any field you decide to go into,” said Ashley Scott ’16 in an interview with The Phillipian after the presentation.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2015'), ('\nThe Sadie Hawkins Dance will be replaced by the Abbot Ball this year in an effort to dismantle gender-normative and heteronormative ideas, said Stephanie Cormier, Student Program Coordinator, and Christopher Capano, Director of Student Activities.\n“We realized that we want all our dances to be as inclusive as possible. We kind of knew that [Sadie’s] was going to go away. Things [like this] kind of went away at other schools too. We’ve been doing it for a lot longer than other places,” said Capano.\nThe idea of a “Sadie Hawkins Dance” originated from a 1940s comic strip called “Li’l Abner.” In the comic strip, Sadie Hawkins’s father, who was the mayor of the town, decided to make a day where Sadie could find a man and force him to say “yes” to her proposal.\nFrom the comic came the idea of “Sadie Hawkins Dance” or “Sadie Hawkins Day,” during which girls could ask boys to date or go to a dance with them. At the time of the comic strip’s publication, this phenomenon was considered contradictory to the normal pattern of boys asking girls out to a dance.\n“We made it [so] that girls ask boys to a dance. But it is based on this horrible, sexist comic strip from a long time ago,” said Capano.\nIn addition, Cormier and Capano felt that many students were put under pressure to ask their partners every year near the time of the dance.\n“We heard from some kids last year that Sadie’s left people out. We [also] thought that Sadie’s was kind of too gender-normative,” said Capano, “If it’s just girls asking, then the boys who want to ask other boys, they’re completely left out.”\nBoth Capano and Cormier said they feel that students should be able to ask anyone, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. The dance will be replaced by Abbot Ball to ensure that there were no insinuations of Sadie’s being the year’s only opportunity for a girl to ask her partner to the dance.\n“Anyone can ask anybody. If a girl wants to ask a boy, I think they should feel free. They should also feel free to ask at any dance. We’re getting that it’s 2015,” said Capano.\nCormier and Capano first heard about the name “Abbot Ball” from some students who had read about the dance in previous years’ yearbooks. The Abbot Ball used to be a Winter Term formal held on Abbot campus.\n“This is like bringing [Abbot Ball] back to Abbot campus. It would be awesome to do… so [in] place [of] Sadie, just [with] a different kind of feeling and vibe about it. So we’re hoping that it’s going to be better because we want better,” said Cormier.\n“I do think that because we’re not completely shutting the dance down, we’re just kind of shifting it back to Abbot Ball. There’s still that empowerment that it is from Abbot Academy. Girls should be empowered to ask other girls or boys to the dance. But to [Capano’s] point, we should be able to do that year round, at any dance that we go to,” said Cormier.\nThe location of the Abbot Ball is not yet finalized, but the Student Activities Office hopes to hold the dance in McKeen Hall, which is on Abbot campus.\n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nAs part of the 2014 Strategic Plan, the Schedule Counseling Committee is considering four potential schedules for the school day, which will go into effect during the 2017-18 school year.\nThe first proposed schedule involves having seven terms instead of three and and three periods in a day instead of seven. Instead of the usual ten weeks, each term will be five weeks long, and students will take between two to three classes. Although class lengths are not finalized, they could range from 75 to 90 minutes instead of the current 45 and 75 minute blocks, said Andy Housiaux, Instructor in Religion and Philosophy and Chair of the Schedule and Calendar Implementation Working Group.\nThe second proposed schedule has four terms and five periods in a day. Students would usually take four courses per term— Juniors would take five courses for two terms, while Lowers, Uppers and Seniors would take only three courses in one term. Students can take a total of five classes since the fourth term will carry on classes from either the first, second or third term. Each term will be eight weeks long with class meeting for a 75 to 90 minute block.\nThe third proposed schedule keeps the current three terms and allows up to six classes per term. It follows the typical Wednesday schedule with three 75 minute classes on Monday and Wednesday and a Thursday schedule with four 75 minute classes on Tuesday and Thursday. Friday will remain the same with seven 45 minute blocks. Classes will also start at 8:15 a.m. and end at 3 p.m., giving students an extra 15 minutes in the morning.\nThe final proposition is to keep the current schedule. All models were created to maintain the current course of study, according to Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning.\nDuring Monday’s faculty meeting, Housiaux said that faculty members led an open discussion in which they spoke about how to support students.\n“We want all of you to thrive — ethically, intellectually, and creatively — and to live balanced lives. We have the sense that this is not always happening. We’re trying to figure out how to best organize time to support all of you in that undertaking,” he said.\n“Does that mean starting the school day at 8:30 a.m so that you could sleep in more? Does that mean thinking about lights out policies or technology policies?” he continued.\nAccording to Housiaux, some faculty members believed that students should take fewer classes per term, and faculty should teach less students, so that students and faculty would getto know each other on a deeper level.\nHousiaux said that the target is to figure out a way to best support students in terms of sleep, stress and time management.\n“We met with a consultant whose job it is to look at schedules and design them. we visited other schools and we’ve read extensively in literature on educational research, utilizing both the librarians at the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library and at Harvard Graduate School of Education,” said Housiaux.\nIn addition to conducting external research, the Schedule and Calendar Implementation Working Group also hosted various sessions in which they would talk to students in focus groups about their experiences with the amount of homework and high level of stress.\nHousiaux also mentioned that as part of their internal research for the new schedule, faculty members will be shadowing students throughout their classes. Four faculty members will each shadow one student. So far, they plan on shadowing two Juniors and two Uppers.\n“A typical day for a student involves a lot of intellectual transitions. [They’re] moving from Chemistry to English, to Math, to their language… [They’re] moving [their] bodies all over campus, having to deal with being hungry after 3rd period but not having lunch until 6th period. The hope with the shadowing is that faculty can better understand what it feels like to be a student and what it’s like to make these kind of transitions,” said Housiaux.\nThe first round of voting for the new schedule will start within the following few weeks. According to Housiaux, the potential choices for schedules will be cut down from four to two by the beginning of December.\n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nPositioned 14,000 feet above sea level, Juan Vallejo, director of the documentary “Cerro Rico, Tierra Rica,” entered a narrow Bolivian mine carrying Coca-Cola and dynamite for the miners. Unable to breathe comfortably, Vallejo steeled himself and continued into the mine. During his presentation last Friday night in Kemper Auditorium, Vallejo described this exploit as one of the most challenging experiences he faced while filming his documentary.\nThe film screening and presentation was part of the Latin Arts Weekend, a weekend consisting of events hosted by Alianza Latina in celebration of Latin culture.\n“Cerro Rico, Tierra Rica” portrays the hardships two mining communities in Bolivia face and the alienation inherent in the work inside the mines. Vallejo focused his documentary on Bolivia to explore the conflict between the indigenous culture and colonization in the country, as well as to reflect on his Latin roots.\n“What I’m most proud of in the film is to be able to show something about our world… and to have learned so much from the [Bolivian] people,” said Vallejo during a question and answer session with the audience.\nVallejo described entering the mines and shooting at a high altitude as some of the most challenging aspects of the film-making process.\n“We had never been in Bolivia. We had never been in a mine, so this was basically our experience as observers who don’t really know the landscape of the film. You have to give the miners gifts – that’s one of the things about being able to enter the mine, whether you’re doing it as a tourist or not. So we had really heavy stuff – you have liters of Coca-Cola for them, you have dynamite, which is also a really weird thing because you’re carrying dynamite with you – because it might explode,” said Vallejo.\n“It’s all very heavy, and you cannot breath when you enter the mine. It was actually psychologically really hard [to go into the mines]. I wanted to leave the first time. I was actually unable to enter the mine at some points when we tried to shoot again,” said Vallejo.\nHe continued, “That, and I think the reality of the work, which is just really tough to observe. Those were the two more difficult things. … You would sleep at night and would barely be able to breath – you feel like you’re suffocating. It’s psychologically really interesting to have to push yourself in those circumstances.”\nVallejo’s mission in creating “Cerro Rico, Tierra Rica” was to paint the picture of people that hold very different lives than those of his viewers using the example of the miners.\n“The main thing is if you can somehow keep some of the information from the film in whatever life is going to allow you to do, then that would be great. Particularly [with] people who are so young and have so much promise… maybe if you grew up and formed your own company, you’ll have some awareness of what paying your employees can do…and be more conscious of certain things,” said Vallejo.\n“The film does not try to really connect the dots. It asks you to put [resonating thoughts] all together and figure stuff out and connect certain things. In a way, [the audience has] to ask the questions and try to answer it if you’re interested in it…. It’s on the audience to weave it all together and make a conclusion out of it,” he continued.\nJust as he pushed himself by documenting the environment of the Bolivian mining communities, Vallejo hopes students can push themselves in their own endeavors through watching this film.\n“The peak in your lives [is] when your mind is probably at the height of its capacities, so I hope that people realize that as a student you can just push yourself to make something that you’ve never done,” said Vallejo.\nSamir Safwan ’16, Co-Head of Alianza Latina, hopes audience members were be able to gain perspective on cultures outside the Andover community from viewing the film.\n“I think [“Cerro Rico, Tierra Rica”] serves to show that there’s a lot more going on outside the United States. There are a lot of families who don’t really have the opportunity to have a professional life,” said Safwan. “In this case, as you see in the film, the [mining is] more of a family [tie], and that’s hard for [the miners] to escape. You see generations after generations of Bolivians in the mountains who are working in the mines,” he continued.\nIn addition to the showing of “Cerro Rico, Tierra Rica,” Latin Arts weekend also featured an interactive Latin dance filled with Latin-style dance lessons and a competition last Saturday.\n“Besides [having an] awareness of the presence of Latin-American students on campus, I think Latin Arts Weekend serves to celebrate the culture and just to celebrate Latin America, and celebrate the Latino and Hispanic cultures,” said Safwan.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nStories of warding off witches and magic echoed throughout the Peabody Museum of Archaeology on Tuesday night, when Emerson Baker ’76, author and Professor of History at Salem State University, gave his presentation called “Witchcraft, Counter Magic and Archaeology in Salem and New England.”\nThe presentation focused on the ways in which people from the 1690s believed in countermagic, a form of protecting oneself against evil, and how they used it to expose witchcraft.\n“In some ways, counter magic is closely related to apotropaic magic, which is the Greek word for turn away. Essentially, there are all sorts of things you can do to try to reveal witches and try to protect yourself from witches…You can even use puppets, what we would call voodoo dolls, where you take the doll and you stab it with a pen, you put its feet over the flames, and the person is inflicted,” said Baker during the presentation.\nThe “Witchcraft, Counter Magic, and Archaeology in Salem and New England,” presentation is part of monthly series held in the Peabody Museum by leading history and archeology experts.\nBaker cited examples of countermagic in New England, ranging from the witch cakes of Salem Village in 1692 to the daisy wheels carved into houses for protection against evil.\n“To make a witch cake, what you essentially do is take the urine of the inflicted people and you mix that with some lovely things like the nail clippings from a dog, you bake it up, and then, in this cake, you feed it to the dog, and when the dog eats it, it reveals the witch,” said Baker.\n“And it makes sense in a weird scientifically twisted 17th century way. There is an invisible current that goes from the witch to the person afflicted, and when they go to the bathroom, what of that infliction goes into the urine, so when you bake it into a cake, and the dog eats it, it is harming the inflicted particles of the witch, essentially harming the witch, so the witch starts yelling and screaming and comes out of hiding,” Baker continued.\nBaker also presented the findings from his latest book, A Storm of Witchcraft: The Salem Trials and the American Experience, which examines the Salem Witch Trials in the broader context of American history. The Salem Witch Trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts in the 1690s.\n“I knew from the research on Salem of examples of countermagic on the houses and it became clear to me that there was a lot of examples of this being used in early New England. When I started re-examining the archaeological work that I’ve done… [it] made me realize there was more going on [in New England] than I believed. The neat thing about studying archeology and material culture, is it gives you a different way of looking at society,” said Baker.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Baker also discussed the connections between National Security today and the U.S government back in 1692. He said that although both governments sought to protect the country and its people, they did so at the expense of the accused witches back then and at the expense of people’s privacy today.\n“If we were in our world in 1692, we would think witches are real. Here’s the problem, we don’t know who they are. They could be anybody, our neighbors, our wives, our children, what do we do? Well, we tell our government to try to solve the problem and they say they are working on it, but how on earth are they going to do this?” said Baker.\n“Unfortunately, as long as we have hatred and prejudice, we will always have scapegoats and witches. And frankly, as long as we have those fears, we’ll also have our countermagic. And that countermagic may take form in a witch’s bottle, or it may take form of electronic eavesdropping [in modern day government],” continued Baker.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nAs the United States launches into the 2016 election season, over 20 Republican and Democratic candidates have begun to polish their campaigns for the voting public. Among them is prominent Andover alumnus and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush ’71.\nAt Andover, Bush captained the Varsity Tennis team and earned a spot on the honor roll. As part of Andover’s student exchange summer program, he taught English as a second language the summer before his Senior year in León, Mexico.  It was there that he met his wife, Columba Garnica Gallo Bush, who would later give him a unique perspective on one of the most controversial topics of the 2016 election: immigration.\nBush has said that he supports a path to legal status – but not citizenship – for undocumented immigrants. He has also advocated the use of a wall or fence to increase border security. In opposition to most Democratic candidates, Bush also wishes to identify and deport people who violate the terms of their stay and defund sanctuary cities that house undocumented immigrants against federal law.\nShelby Butt ’16, Co-President of the PA Republicans Society and a student representative for the Jeb Bush campaign, said, “I do agree with most Republicans in that we should secure the border before we start to look for a path to citizenship or legal status… I think that [Bush] will differ in the fact that he’s had personal experience with immigration via his wife and his wife’s family.    That will give him a unique ability to reach out to immigrants and think about immigrants in a very personal, humanistic way.”\n“I support his path to legal status, not necessarily citizenship, but just the path to being able to legally live in the United States, whether that would be with Green Cards or anything else,” she continued.\nCaroline Mesinger ’16, Vice-President of the PA Democrats Society, said, “[Bush] has great ideas for legalizing ‘illegal immigrants,’ but he doesn’t want them to become citizens… he wants everyone that comes to America to assimilate into some kind of, presumably, white culture, which I don’t agree with, which is what puts a sour note into my mouth for any kind of immigration policy because our country is founded on multiculturalism.”\nGun control has been another big issue for Bush. As the governor of Florida, he implemented the 10-20-Life Law in 2005, a mandatory minimum sentencing act regarding the use of a firearm during the commission of a forcible felony.\n“I agree with Jeb Bush’s push for instant background checks when a gun is purchased, and I think his 10-20 law is a good start, but I honestly don’t think he’s doing enough. Florida, the state in which he was governor, is a very pro-gun state that’s [heavy] on allowing concealed carry, and personally, concealed carry makes me a little uncomfortable,” wrote Butt in an email to The Phillipian.\nJerry Yang ’17, a member of the Andover club for the Jeb Bush campaign, in an email to The Phillipian, added, “I don’t necessarily agree with all [of Bush’s] stances. I think the 10-20-Life Law as Florida governor was going in the right direction. I do support stricter background checks, but it’s also important to reduce the gun violence culture in America. I think the law… helps emphasize the consequence of gun violence, but [we need] stricter background checks.”\nBush is currently fourth in the Republican primary. He is polling at 7.1 percent according to HuffPost Pollster. In order to appeal to more voters and increase his poll numbers, Bush needs to display a higher level of energy, members of the PA Republicans’ Society said.\n“[Bush is] a little bit more reserved as a person… He’s trying to be more energetic, and as a candidate, he does a lot of things that are important for a president to do, but charisma, in that aspect, he could improve… Just for the campaign,” said Yang.\nButt hopes that members of a predominantly liberal student body will look past Bush’s family name to his policies before making a decision on which candidate or party to support.\n“It’s unfortunate that he’s an alum and he’s maybe not valued as much as maybe he should be.  I think if people will be open-minded to the fact that he’s not a hardcore, far-to-the-right conservative… and they actually take the chance… to look at his actual policies, I think more and more liberals would see that he’s not so different from another middle-of-the-road liberal candidate,” she said.\nThe Phillipian was unable to reach the Jeb Bush campaign for a statement.\n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nArriving at Abbot Academy in the fall of 1964 as a young immigrant from the Dominican Republic, Julia Alvarez AA ’67 found herself grappling with issues of alienation and assimilation for the first time, a story she shared at Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM).\nAlvarez, a renowned author and poet, spoke about moving to the United States and dealing with a lack of diversity and acceptance of immigrants in the nation during ASM. On stage, she was awarded the 2015 Alumni Award of Distinction, an honor bestowed on alumni who have served with distinction while embodying the values of Phillips and Abbot Academy.\n“For the first time in my life, I experienced prejudice and playground cruelty [when I arrived in the United States]. I struggled with the language and culture I didn’t understand. I was heart-broken,” said Alvarez. “[My sisters and I] learned the new language, the new way to dress and behave ourselves. Diversity and multiculturalism… That vocabulary had yet to be invented.”\nBorn in New York, NY., Alvarez was raised for most of her early childhood in the Dominican Republic, during the era of Dominican President Rafael Trujillo’s regime. She and her family were forced to leave their country and immigrate to the United States after her father participated in a failed plot to overthrow Trujillo.\nBlending Dominican and American culture was a struggle for Alvarez as she searched for a place where she felt she truly belonged.\n“I had become a hybrid… I was not an American girl, and I was not only a Dominican girl anymore, and yet I wanted to desperately belong somewhere….I see how lucky I was to have found a place that could nourish the new American self I was becoming. Of course [though], back then, like any other outsider, I yearned for that warm, cozy, privileged feeling of belonging,” said Alvarez.\nAlvarez’s most famous novels, “How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents” and “In Time of the Butterflies,” center on topics of cultural hybridization and the Trujillo dictatorship, respectively.\nDuring her ASM speech, Alvarez invited the community to recognize the similarities between one another by emphasizing the statistics in the Human Genome Project, the sequencing of the entire human genome, which was completed in 2000. She underscored the fact that humans are 99.9 percent genetically similar to each other.\n“[However,] our true diversity as a community lies in each one of you discovering and developing that one tenth of one percent that only you can bring back to the 99.9 percent that is overlapping with everyone else… your unique talent is not yours. You have to bring forth and bring back to the rest of us,” said Alvarez.\nFollowing her appearance at ASM, Alvarez gave a separate presentation on the power of storytelling and activism, as well as her work in the nonprofit organization, Border of Lights, in Kemper Auditorium on Wednesday night. In her presentation, Alvarez spoke about what activism and humanitarianism means to her.\n“Activism is the need to discover, develop and bring forth that unique talent in each of you for the benefit of the human family. The benefit of the human family is what makes it activism,” said Alvarez.\n“It makes me proud of who I am and where I come from to know that there is another Dominican out there with the same history of having to leave the home country and live in two worlds, two different value systems. It makes me keep fighting, makes me always remember to stay close to my roots,” said Anny Candelario-Escobar, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science.\nAlvarez is currently a faculty member and writer-in-residence at Middlebury College, where she teaches creative writing on a part time basis, advises Latino students and serves as an outside reader for creative writing theses written by English majors at the school.\n\n', 'Oct 22, 2015'), ('\nIn a deviation from the standard march to the Cochran Chapel, students and faculty dispersed across campus to meet in smaller groups in place of Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM). Faculty members facilitated discussions on healthy relationships with smaller, more intimate groups of students, as announced at ASM on September 23.\n“The main goal… is to just break ground in terms of discussion: making [discussion about sex] not awkward. The very fact that we’re talking about this and that the school is making an effort to get people into classrooms and talk about healthy intimate relationships and what these things entail, I think that removes some of the stigma associated with [these discussions],” said Denise Alfonso, Instructor in Chemistry, who led a dialogue with a group of Juniors.\nWhile the general topic of these conversations centered on healthy relationships, different groups discussed a wide range of issues, from slut-shaming to Andover’s hook-up culture. Discussions also touched upon respect in emotional and physical intimacy, as well as consent. Ground rules to encourage anonymity and sensitivity were established in each group.\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, said that the increased demand for improved sexual education by students led faculty members to think about ways in which to spur conversations around such topics on campus.\n“We’re trying to figure out and pilot a number of different initiatives to inform our ‘Empathy and Balance’ curriculum next year. This year feels like a really opportune time to collect information and to try out a couple of different structures and strategies for delivering content,” said Jennifer Elliott, Dean of Students.\nThe format of Wednesday’s discussions was based on feedback given by student leaders in Be LOVED, a three-day retreat for Seniors interested in learning how to build a community, and Personal and Community Engagement (PACE), as well as Proctors and Prefects. These student leaders requested a forum for sexual health conversations involving same grade and mixed genders, facilitated by faculty. The student body met with peers in their English classes in an effort to create diverse groups within grades.\n“When you have a large group, you make sure that everyone gets the same sort of information and the same message… but sometimes it’s a little impersonal, and people might not totally relate. Having small groups provides an environment for them to discuss anything they might have heard in school meetings or outside of that,” said Alfonso.\nMax Vale ’18 said that the mixture of boarders and day students within the small groups also allowed the groups to see multiple perspectives.\nThe event was planned by the Dean of Students Office in conjunction with Isham and Graham House. Faculty received training at meetings and worked with the Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Power Players and trainers from Mentors in Violence Prevention to gain context for the discussions.\n“I expected it to be something similar to the talk that we have in our dorm… but we also got feedback from the faculty members in our groups, which was different. I really appreciated that because I got a better idea of what the faculty members know and think of the hook-up culture and the [sexual education] on campus,” said Lara Guvelioglu ’16.\nJuniors will have the chance to continue the dialogue in the same groups next Wednesday. While feedback is still being gathered, participants have expressed interest in meeting again to further engage in the discussion. Students and faculty alike have praised the intimacy of the discussions.\n“You can’t ever hear too many people’s [opinions] on a subject because everyone has something different to say… Everyone says it in a different way. I think it’s important to listen to everyone and their experiences… Not everyone in my English class is close, but it was nice to have a very confident group willing to share their experiences,” said Guvelioglu.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nA selection from Claudio Monteverdi’s opera “’L’incoronazione di Poppea” resonated throughout the School Room in Abbot Hall as Janice Cheon ’16 stood before the audience last Monday afternoon for her Brace Fellow presentation.\nHer presentation, entitled, “Gender and Sexuality in Baroque Opera and Modern Performance,” aimed to promote change in society’s heteronormative mindset by encouraging the Andover community to reflect on the Castrati legacy. The Castrati were male singers during the Baroque period who were castrated before they went through puberty to retain their high and unbroken voices.\n“Fortunately, in recent years, our society has opened up to more conversations about gender and sexuality, and also we have become more accepting toward the L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. community,” said Cheon during the presentation. “I believe that Baroque Operas that still exist on the shadows of Castrado may help us understand a time when gender and sexuality fluidity was treated as the societal norm.”\nWhile Cheon highlighted the outstanding singing of the Castrati, she also related their success to the “one sex and gender model,” which was a widely accepted explanation of the differences between sexes.\nAccording to Cheon’s research, the “one sex and gender model” was the belief in one continuous spectrum of sex. Adult heterosexual men and women were on opposite ends of the spectrum, and people who freely expressed their genders were in between. The Castrati were located in the middle of the spectrum as adolescent males.\n“Since all genders were regarded as matters of degree on the one gender continuum… differences in sex were more quantitative than qualitative,” said Cheon. “The effect of castration [of the Castrati] was to preserve a boy’s charm, his beautiful face and voice,” she continued.\nFollowing the dawn of the 18th century, however, the Enlightenment filled Europe with the notion of humanism, stressing the importance of individual men. Cheon described a new explanation of sex that proved the previous gender and sex model wrong.\n“Women and men were now regarded as two polar opposites. Sex as well as gender was fixed as stable, and crossing the divide between adult mankind and adult womankind was unnatural and regarded as sacrilegious,” said Cheon in her presentation.\nEventually, the practice of castration was regarded as barbaric and unacceptable, and Castrati was excluded from European society. Nowadays the bass baritone, countertenor and female singers replace the Castrato performance to continue the Baroque Opera.\n“I want to show my belief that modern production of Baroque Opera should strive to combine… original opera with modern vocal technique and some of modern culture as well,” Cheon said.\nToward the end of her presentation, Cheon encouraged members of the Andover community to reflect upon the historical changes of gender and sex perception. Cheon hopes that the instances of modern Castrato performances will help facilitate the ongoing debate upon the transforming standards and roles of sex and gender.\n“I am a violinist, a big fan of music and a big fan of opera. I have always enjoyed Baroque and Classical Operas more so than the huge romantic and 20th century operas that opera fans usually enjoy. I also discovered the CD, on my own, of Philippe Jaroussky, and I was blown away by the stunning quality of his voice. He is a French counter tenor, absolutely a gorgeous singer and a fabulous person. This basically sparked my interest,” said Cheon.\nAlthough unsure at first, Cheon said she felt prompted to do more research into opera and Baroque music after discovering this CD. She then contacted both the Brace Center and the music department for some guidance and support with her project.\n“Both institutions were open and receptive to this idea. So I think it was a great way for me to investigate more of the style of music that I play and also understand this whole one sex model – I was not even aware of it when I started the research, and I grew from that. I am very happy that I went in this direction,” said Cheon.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nAs the ball soared into the net, echoing cheers and laughter erupted as ARC participants and volunteers played in the Case Memorial Cage last Tuesday evening.\nARC, a community engagement program, aims to provide a space for community members with mental and physical disabilities to spend time with a student buddy from Andover.\n“My favorite part of ARC is the first day…when everyone sees their buddy again for the first time and just seeing the way peoples’ faces light up. You can see how much [this program] affects people,” said Maddie Comer ’16, a student coordinator of ARC.\nARC is not an acronym. The word “ARC” represents the bridging relationships between community members and students that are developed through spending time at this program together.\n“From the office standpoint, behind the scenes and organizing to get this program ready is so great. Every week we have buddies calling the office saying that they’re so excited to show up. I think the dedication from both the students and the buddies from the community that participate is just amazing…It’s a great way to spend your Tuesday night and great to see the relationships evolve,” said Julia Howard, a faculty advisor for the program.\nIn ARC, community members can be found playing volleyball, dancing to music playing on the radio, walking around the track or simply talking to their student buddies.\nThe program is led by Howard, Fellow in the Office of Community Engagement, Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Engagement and student coordinators Maddie Comer ’16, Connor Haugh ’17 and Laura Bilal ’17. As one of the longest running community engagement programs at Andover, ARC allows students to step out of their comfort zone, encouraging them to work with and get to know a community member with a disability.\n“I just wanted to try something new and I [told myself] ‘get out of your comfort zone.’ [ARC] did push me, I’m not going to lie, the first few weeks were tough…You get an appreciation for everything we have. Anything makes them happy…they light up when they see you. That was something that made me keep coming back and made me want to do it again and become more involved,” said Bilal.\nOriginally established as a children’s program, ARC has evolved into a program based on adults with mental disabilities.\nDarian Bhathena ’16, a student participant in ARC, said, “I think what’s most special about [ARC] is how happy [my buddy and I] make each other. [My buddy] always gets really happy when she turns around and sees me standing there. It’s a real thrill to see her every week because she makes everything a little bit brighter.”\nWith ARC community members ranging from those who are unable to speak and wheelchair bound, to those who are fully functional and employed, Andover students are paired with their buddies according to experience and comfortability in working with these conditions.\n“I think it’s important to understand that you’re not only doing [ARC] for yourself, [your buddies] rely on you. It is definitely humbling in the sense that you’re helping them, but they’re also helping you understand and be compassionate and just take a step back from Andover and realize we are a small portion of this world. There is a big, broader community out there,” said Bilal.\nLaura Bilal ’17 is a Sports Associate, and Connor Haugh ’17 is a Business Associate for The Phillipian, Vol. CXXXVIII.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nAfter dipping her bicycle wheel into the Atlantic Ocean in Charleston, S.C., as a symbolic start to her  journey to come, Leah Adelman ’17 set off with ten other teenage girls to bike across the country. A few minutes into the trip, and a few miles from from Charleston’s Folly Beach, she looked back and realized that the next time she would see the ocean would be once she arrived in San Diego, CA, 2,740 miles away.\nThe six week trip across nine different states was organized by Girl Up, a United Nations campaign for supporting the development and empowerment of adolescent girls in developing countries, by focusing on girls’ education, health, safety and documentation.\nDuring the ride, Adelman biked for nine to 12 hours each day and slept in school gyms and on church floors, stopping occasionally at motels and campsites.\nWhile biking across the country, Adelman spent much of her time reflecting on her life and appreciating the many privileges she has that many girls in other countries or communities do not.\n“I was thinking about how I was doing this for Girl Up, about those girls and what their life experiences would be like, and about how lucky I am and how fortunate I am to go to school,” said Adelman.\nAdelman first discovered her love for cycling during her freshman year at Andover. As part of the Andover Cycling team, she rides 15-30 miles during each practice in the spring. Adelman said she often feels transported from campus as she rides.\n“[Biking] really gives me a sense of freedom and independence and I feel powerful and I feel strong. I love to race and I also love the accomplishment that comes with it. I love being outside and experiencing nature and my surroundings that are in a way very different from being in a car,” said Adelman.\nShe remarked how the routes the cycling team takes – racing down winding roads and passing small farm houses on the sides – remind her of Europe.\n“It is really special to be able to step – or rather, ride – outside of the Andover Bubble each afternoon of the spring as a reminder that there is so much more to this world than homework and grades,” said Adelman.\nWhen Adelman was introduced to Girl Up for the first time last year by Sydney Baumgardt ’16, she immediately felt prompted to get involved by fundraising and raising awareness for promoting the development and empowerment of girls around the world.\nNow, Adelman hopes to introduce a Girl Up club on campus along with Baumgardt and Carmen Bango ’16. The club will focus on raising awareness for Girl Up and will run fundraisers for the organization.\n“I think [this club] is unique because we are looking at women’s and girl’s issues pertaining to other countries. That is what Girl Up focuses on. I think that is kind of a new thing to have on campus because there are a lot of feminist discussions but looking at it from a global perspective is the [main] idea,” said Adelman.\nThrough this event, Adelman raised a total of $5,756 to donate to Girl Up. Adelman will continue to stay involved with the organization by attending summits and by sharing ideas with teenagers around the country who are also committed to empowering girls around the globe.\n“It was really great to use this passion I found at Andover and use it for good. It was meaningful for me to prove that adolescent girls can be strong,” said Adelman.\nShe added, “Accomplishing this was proving to myself and everyone that a 16-year-old is capable of powering herself through the country. Sometimes [society] looks at adolescent girls as being weak or being unable to do things and to say that I biked all the way across America, it goes right along with empowering girls in other countries and showing them that they are strong.”\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nWhen the power in her house shut down and the air-conditioner turned off, Alex-Maree Roberts ’16, from the Commonwealth of Dominica, woke up from her sleep to the jarring sound of violent rain, she recalled in an interview with The Phillipian. Along with her sister, Roberts took bottles and pots outside the house in hopes of collecting rainwater to wash the dishes. She realized then that she was in the middle of Tropical Storm Erika, one of Dominica’s deadliest storms ever.\nRoberts lives in Pointe Michel, a small fishing village in the southern part of the island. Tropical Storm Erika hit the Commonwealth of Dominica on August 27 without warning. The storm caused flooding and mudslides throughout the island, blocking roads and destroying numerous buildings.\n“There were landslides blocking roads so we couldn’t drive north or south. My dad and my sister and I walked about two miles to get gasoline to power our generator so I saw some of the damage in the nearby area firsthand. We didn’t have electricity or power for most of the day so we were kind of limited in what we could see. In my house, it just [seemed] like a lot of rain, but there was news that there were people taken away by the river from their houses or from the church,” said Roberts.\nUpon her return to Andover, Roberts wanted to find a way to support her community back at home. After watching videos of other Dominicans in the United States who were starting similar projects on their respective school campuses, she decided to fundraise at Andover.\n“A lot of the money back home is being put into fixing roads and bridges and providing immediate relief for people who have lost their homes. Some kids haven’t been [back] to school yet and [my family and I] wanted to give to a cause that a lot of people don’t pay enough attention to,” she said.\nWith the help of her friends and student volunteers, Roberts started fundraising last Thursday and Friday in Paresky Commons to help with the repairing of schools in Dominica.\n“I know that this community is really big on ‘non sibi’ and community engagement and I figured that the people here would help. I have a big belief that the people here would want to help those who are not as fortunate, especially considering that this is such a privileged place to be,” said Roberts.\nThe money that Roberts collects here will be wired directly to an account back in the Commonwealth of Dominica and sent to the Ministry of Education. The donations collected at Andover will be used by the Ministry of Education to purchase construction materials and books needed by schools.\nThe first school that Roberts wants to help is the Pichelin Primary School, located in the isolated town of Pichelin.\n“We’re going to start from the hardest-hit and see how far that takes us. I’d like to help as many schools as possible, but I understand that I can’t just expect people to sponsor a complete revamp of all the schools. I am new to this fundraising business and I’m just being very optimistic about it,” she said.\nIn an effort to aid Roberts and her mission, Susanne Torabi, International Students Coordinator, told her about the Phillips Academy Natural Disaster Aid (P.A.N.D.A.), a collaborative effort created by students in 2008 who then were raising money to help repair damages from the Sichuan earthquake. This year, Roberts hopes to revive P.A.N.D.A.\n“Once I learned about the tragic news of what happened in [Roberts’] home country, I was worried how she and her family were doing and immediately reached out to her. I have supported lots of students in the past in similar situations, which is why P.A.N.D.A. got started,” wrote Torabi in an email interview with The Phillipian.\n“I want to keep the name P.A.N.D.A. going because natural disasters happen frequently and if people keep this [effort] going and keep awakening it then it’s going to remind the community that it’s not a new thing for us to help [those] who are struck by disaster. This may be a new project but it’s not a new idea to the Andover community,” said Roberts.\nRoberts said she plans to continue fundraising to rebuild Dominican schools for at least the rest of the month.\n“Right now I don’t have a concrete goal [or] number I’m aiming for but [Andover’s] response has been really positive. People have asked how they can help, not just in donations but what more they can do to help the Dominican community. It’s really heartwarming to see that people are not just willing to give money but also time and effort,” said Roberts.\nFrom the donations she received during her first week of fundraising, Roberts has so far collected a total of $411.12.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nTwo major changes will be implemented to the advising system starting in the next academic year. All boarding Lowers will have their House Counselors or complement as their academic advisors, and the College Counseling Office (CCO) will initiate contact with students starting their Lower year, as opposed to their Upper year.\nThe Dean of Studies Office decided to remodel the Lower advising system based on the success of the current Junior advising system, in which students have their own House Counselor or complement as their academic advisors. In the revised advising system, Uppers will be assigned advisors based on their own preference.\n“[With the current system,] we end up having Lowers advised by someone new and someone who is difficult to access because they’re generally people who our Lowers have no connections with. Our system has been working fine overall for many students, but we felt like there was a better way to go,” said Scott Hoenig, Assistant Dean of Studies for Advising.\nHoenig added that having House Counselors as advisors would be more beneficial and convenient because students could cultivate closer relationships with their advisors and have easier access when in need of advising.\n“The big thing that we heard from students is wanting a closer connection with advisors, wanting an advisor that they have had some kind of shared connection with whether it was a coach or a House Counselor or somebody who taught them… I think we’re going to be able to accommodate a lot of those desires because faculty and parents think it’s a good idea too,” said Hoenig.\nThe dorm-based advising system for Lowers was partially piloted this year. Some House Counselors already have two to five Lowers from their dorm in their advising group.\nThe advising system for day students will remain the same.\nThe College Counseling Office is also under revision. The office will get in touch with students to discuss the college application process during Lower year. This, however, does not necessarily mean that college counselors will be assigned to students during their Lower year. The Dean of Students Office is still discussing the extent of the college counselling office’s earlier involvement.\nAdditionally, there will be one meeting each term where Lowers can familiarize themselves with CCO. These meetings will commence this Friday; Lower day students will meet some of the college counselors with their advisors to discuss ways to alleviate anxiety and stress during the college application process.\n“This will enable students to build relationships or at least start to get to know college counselors, even if it’s not their college counselor. It will be getting to know the office, building some trust between students and college counselors and advisors and therefore, paving the way to better relationships down the road,” said Hoenig.\nHoenig hopes that college counselors will be able to review course requests before they are officialized by the scheduling office for certain students.\n“Certain students who are maybe first generation college students or underrepresented minority students who may have special considerations and need to be extra careful with how they schedule their program to study here, college counselors may be able to take a close look at [them] and just generally be available for students to ask for guidance,” he said.\nThese two changes were devised after the Strategic Plan Implementation Working Group for Advising and Counseling studied surveys sent out to the student body last winter regarding the advising system and athletics at Andover. The group also took into consideration the survey responses from parents, Seniors and faculty, anonymous questionnaires filled out by students and advisor evaluations.\nHoenig said that the Dean of Studies Office hopes to better utilize technology in the advising system. In particular, the office hopes to develop an online multi-year course planning worksheet.\n“Right now what we have is all in notebooks, we have hard-copies [of worksheets to keep track of diploma requirements, notes from previous advisors and multi-year planning worksheets] because we don’t have a good way to electronically track all of this so we have to do it by hand. We count on advisors to come up with multi-year plans first and include them in the advisor binder then to pass it on to the advisees…I think it would be much better to have that in an electronic format,” said Hoenig.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nSolemnly cradling plastic candles, students gathered on the cold granite steps of Samuel Phillips Hall on Saturday night to participate in the first Border of Lights Vigil at Andover.\nStarted by Dominican writer Julia Alvarez AA ’67 in 2012, Border of Lights is an international human rights collaborative that commemorates the 1937 Parsley Massacre in which 1,000 to 12,000 Haitians were killed in the Dominican Republic under the rule of then Dominican dictator, Rafael Trujillo, according to an introductory speech at the vigil.\nAlianza Latina decided to hold a Border of Lights Vigil at Andover this year in hopes of bringing awareness of the massacre to campus and reflecting on the issue of border tensions.\n“We gather here today not only to recognize the border tensions between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but also border tensions around the world, because this is something that happens,” said Samir Safwan ’16, Co-Head of Alianza Latina.\nAt the start of the vigil, students learned about the historical background behind the Parsley Massacre and read some sections of the poem “Parsley” by Rita Dove. Afterwards, students observed a moment of silence for not only the victims of the genocide, but for victims of border conflict around the world.\nThe Parsley Massacre began when Trujillo ordered his soldiers to keep Haitians from entering the Dominican Republic. To differentiate Haitians from Dominicans, the soldiers carried a bag of parsley and asked each person migrating to the Dominican Republic to say parsley in Spanish, or “perejil.”\nSince the Haitians spoke Creole, they would instead say “persil” and be shot immediately by Trujillo’s soldiers.\nCarmen Muñoz-Fernández, Instructor in Spanish and Co-Advisor of Alianza Latina, said, “It is so tragic, and something that still affects the relationships between the two countries.”\nAngelica Lara ’16, Co-Head of Alianza Latina, said that she wanted the vigil to bring attention towards different countries also suffering from border issues.\n“[The vigil] gave me more hope because we are commemorating events like these. This not only commemorates the 1937 massacre, but it also honors all other border troubles around the world,” said Lara.\nSarah Langr ’18 said that the vigil was important in helping students recognize that some people in other countries do not have the same access to freedom as Andover students.\n“Knowing that other people out there who currently are still not allowed to say and be who they want [to be] upsets me. And recognizing that people have died just [so] that other people can live and express their culture. People need to recognize that,” said Langr.\nClara Isaza-Bishop, Chair of the Spanish Department and Faculty Advisor to Alianza Latina, noted that the damaging consequences of Haiti-Dominican Republic border issues are lessons that Andover and its neighboring town, Lawrence, can learn from.\nIsaza-Bishop said, “I like to think about our own border with Lawrence, because Lawrence sometimes seem so far away. If [people from Lawrence] don’t look like the way most people do at Andover, unfortunately [they] might get stopped by the police. So there is also a tension between Andover and Lawrence.”\nThe Parsley Massacre is commemorated in many places all over the world through lectures, arts, exhibitions, and education projects. Last year, Alianza Latina celebrated Border of Lights by going to the Border of Light’s Vigil in Lawrence.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nReed Findlay ’18 cycled around the world through countries such as Mongolia, Iceland, Netherlands and Germany, witnessing firsthand the power of a single bike to change someone’s life. Inspired by its power to help those who do not have access to any other modes of access, Findlay decided to help fundraise for the charity, Bicycles for Humanity (B4H).\nEach trip, he has received money from his sponsors for the number of miles he biked and has donated his earnings to B4H. The charity then pays for all shipping and packaging of the bikes that are donated to impoverished communities around the world.\n“When I’m on these trips, it’s such a different life than here, back home, because all you have to worry about is yourself and the bike. You just get up in the morning knowing that all you have to conquer is 10 hours of being on a bike and to just keep going. I love that feeling, the biking lifestyle,” said Findlay.\nFindlay’s older brother first founded the Boston Chapter of the organization in 2012 upon his return from a bike trip across the southern Africa.\n“A bicycle solves the problem of mobility in developing countries and helps empower impoverished people to change their life. With the aid of a bike, students can attend distant schools, health care workers can reach more patients and adults can gain access to jobs and haul more goods in less time,” said Findlay.\nAfter realizing the impact a single bicycle can make, Findlay, his older sister and his brother started working to gather used bikes for donations, repair them and ship them overseas to a small village in Botswana.\n“I love the feeling when someone [contacts] me and says, ‘I have a bike to donate,’ because I know they’ve taken the time to think about where that bike in their garage [actually] is and who it will help. I love thinking that just the simple machine with two wheels that can empower them to change their own life, to get to school, to be able to work, to help their children,” said Findlay.\nHis current project plans to send 500 bicycles, along with bicycle repair tools, in 40-foot containers to the town of Ramotswa in Botswana. The shipping containers will then serve as Bicycle Empowerment Centers, non-profit bicycle repair shops in the community.\nAlong with providing the bicycles and repairing tools, the BH4 organization works with local people to help them develop the skills they need to manage bike programs and to ensure the community can maximize the resources they receive.\n“My brother and I have worked closely with the government of Botswana, as well as bicycle and community organizers, towards the goal of making the bike workshop locally sustainable,” said Findlay.\nFindlay’s avid support of B4H stems both from his passion for biking and from his first-hand observations of the impact that one bicycle can have on a life.\n“I have always been inspired by the mobility a single bike offers and have biked across several countries in support of B4H-Boston. In addition to raising funds and awareness, my summer rides have shown me first-hand how a bike can actually change a life,” said Findlay.\n“Pedaling through impoverished communities where better mobility could be the difference between being educated or healthy or having a job has had a motivating impact on me,” he continued.\nFindlay plans to hold a bike collection event for the Boston Chapter of B4H this weekend, at a location about 5 miles from Andover. The donations will be added to the Botswana project this November.\n“Recycling a bike in Andover can change a life in Africa. Many New Englanders have helped make a difference since we started two years ago. We hope to continue connecting communities near and far not only with bike relief but also with recycling ideas that translate into useful pedal powered devices that help communities in need,” said Findlay.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2015'), ('\nClaire Glover ’16, one of this year’s Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholars, stood before a full audience in Kemper Auditorium on Friday night to share her personal and historical experience on reconnecting with her Swedish heritage.\nGlover’s talk, which was titled “Journeys Home: Echoes of Heritage,” emphasized the importance of home and ethnicity in relation to her own Swedish heritage. She began her speech with her personal experience of reconnecting with Swedish culture several summers ago when she visited Stockholm for the first time and met her extended family.\n“I was embraced, welcomed and loved in a place that should have seemed strange to me, and that outpouring of love immediately brought me closer to my Swedish roots. Staying loyal to a specific ethnicity through generations has kept my family strong and self-aware,” she said during the presentation.\nGlover provided the historical context of her broader topic by discussing the migration of Northern Europeans to the New World between 1890 and 1913. She distinguished the migrants who chose to maintain strong cultural, linguistic or religious ties to their homelands from those who chose to adopt American culture more completely.\n“The dissolution of the specific ethnic communities, including the dissipation of religious distinctions and intermarriage of European descendants, has created a gap in the lives of many white Americans of European descent,” said Glover.\nAfter Glover’s presentation, five student and faculty panelists—BrianPaul Robert ’16, Kieto Mahaniah ’16, Karissa Kang ’17, Debra Pickering, Instructor in French, and Glover’s mother, Ellen Greenberg, Instructor in Mathematics—took the stage to share stories of their own ethnicities and homes with the audience.\n“I look out in the audience and think that this is my home and this is my family because you have all helped raise [Claire] and her brothers here. Thank you for providing the kind of love and support that makes a home a home. I have brought up the Swedish culture to Claire as my mother brought it to me. It has always been so important to me and clearly it has also impacted Claire,” said Greenberg.\nGreenberg concluded by sharing the story of how she herself was able to return to visit Sweden with the school’s funding to reconnect her extended family and home. With only a postcard in hand, Greenberg was able to find the location of and presence of her ancestors in a town near Stockholm.\nWhile preparing for her research, Glover said that she especially enjoyed listening and relating to other people’s narratives about their homes, heritages and cultures.\n“I loved how everyone I talked to bombarded me with stories… Everyone shares their stories with me because it is so relatable when you say ‘I am looking into stories of home and belonging.’ I chose [a topic] that I not only love but I know a lot of other people also love thinking and talking about,” said Glover.\nGlover also emphasized the importance of acknowledging the fact that not everyone held such positive views toward their ethnicity. She said that, while she has not personally experienced any negative aspects of her own ethnicity as a white American of European descent, others may feel otherwise.\n“It is universal to embrace your stories, but at the same time, it is not without cost for some people. There are negatives and positives for ethnicities… [and] for some cultures and people, there are negatives that are really significant. So [knowing that] being able to embrace your culture while appreciating [it] is not available for everyone, is important,” she continued.\nGlover hoped to encourage members of the Andover community to begin exploring their own heritage through her presentation.\n“I feel so strongly about Sweden and about finding people you love across the globe–finding places that make you feel calm,” said Glover. “So I wanted to write about how universal [this feeling] is and how everyone thinks like that. Certain places are their homes and everyone has stories to share.”\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nThis article is a continuation of last week’s article “Meet the New Faculty Members.”\nAda Fan, Instructor in English\nWhat are your official roles on campus this year?\nI’m teaching three courses, English 200, another 200 section and a [section of English] 300. [I’m] co-advising The Phillipian, a compliment in America House, an advisor and an interviewer for the admissions office.\nWhat is your favorite book to teach?\nI’ve been teaching Moby Dick. I don’t know if I’ve been entirely successful with that, but I keep going back to it because everything is in it. [There’s] a multicultural backdrop and the clash of human cultures, lots of really great Shakespearean references and there’s a wonderful sort of cosmic, philosophical rumination.\nWhat is your favorite part of the Andover community?\nI think that the setting is beautiful. I’m very comfortable here because even though I’m [considered] new, this is actually my 25th year here. I taught for 24 years here. It feels like home to me. The people are great, but I think [my favorite part], most of all, [is] the intellectual intensity. Not every single individual, perhaps, but collectively, I think there’s this wonderful intellectual intensity.\nKassy Fritz, College Counseling\nWhat are your roles on campus this year?\nMy primary role is Director of College Counseling. I also have a group of seniors that I’m working with. On 158 Main Street, there are two boys who live in a dorm and I’m a house counselor there.\nWhat is your favorite part about being a counselor and working with kids?\nI’ve always loved college counseling because it’s an opportunity to work closely with students and their lives here, but then begin to have them understand and appreciate what’s next. One of the things we’re working towards is starting to demystify the fear of the college process and really have it be something that kids are excited about–that you recognize that it’s something you’re well prepared [for] coming from a school like Andover.\nWhat is your favorite Commons food?\nEvery time I go there, it’s always something new and exciting! The spa water is pretty outstanding, and the salad bar is always offering something pretty unique.\nSuzanne Heon, Graham House Counselor\nWhat are your roles on campus this year?\nAs a Psychological Counselor and Wellness Educator, I provide both counseling at Graham House and wellness education across campus. I will also be involved in teaching PACE and assisting with development of the Empathy and Balance curriculum.\nWhat is your favorite Commons food?\nI’m consistently amazed by the quality of the food at Commons. Given how\ngood the food has been, I don’t think I can pick a favorite.\nWhy did you decide to come to Andover?\nFrom the moment I stepped foot on campus, it just felt right. I was impressed by the dedication of the faculty and the mission of the school, but what truly made my decision was the group of students I met on my interview day. As I walked away from having lunch with the students, I remember thinking that it would be incredibly rewarding to work with such an intelligent, diverse, and inquisitive group of young people. The opening of the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center and the opportunity to be part of the Empathy and Balance initiative were also extremely exciting opportunities for me.\nJulia Howard, Fellow in the Office of Community Engagement\nWhat are your official roles on campus this year?\nI am the new Fellow in Community Engagement. My role is that I assist with all the programming and scheduling that goes on in the Community Engagement Office. I also serve as a house complement to Clement House.\nWhy do you think the Community Engagement Office is important to students?\nI think it’s an important office because our emphasis through all our programs is to give students a hands-on opportunity to engage with different people and communities through different projects and work. I graduated college as a sociology major, and I remember that the experiences that really brought what I learned in the classroom to life was when I was out in the community engaging with other people and learning from them.\nWhat is your favorite Commons food?\nI really like Sunday dinner when it’s turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing. That whole combination is quite good. I’m also pretty impressed with the cappuccino bar.\nJill Kozloff, Instructor in Chemistry\nWhat are your roles on campus this year?\nI am teaching Chemistry 250 and 500, I am a complimentary House Counselor in Bancroft and I am the assistant coach for the Boys and Girls Varsity Water Polo teams.\nWhat’s your favorite part of teaching Chemistry?\nMy favorite part of teaching Chemistry is probably getting kids who have decided that they’re not science people to think of themselves as science students. Getting them to realize that they actually like Chemistry, and that they’re actually good at it and that they can be science people. Teaching kids that they don’t have to decide after Biology 100 whether they’re scientifically inclined or not. That there’s a different class that they have a shot at that’s completely different from Biology. Kids will find that they’re really good at Chemistry, or really like Chemistry and not have been the best at Biology. It’s fun to break kids down with what they think they know about themselves.\nJames Kuper, Graham House Intern\nWhy did you come to Andover?\nFirst, Andover is known for its tight-knit community of extraordinary people. How could I not check it out? Second, the clinical training provided by Carol Israel and her staff at Graham House is top notch. Third, while I never attended Andover, I did spend some time at a boarding school. It was a remarkable experience. The adults in my life played a major role in my development both positively and negatively. I suppose part of me wanted to pay it forward, in some way the positive part, of course.\nWhy does psychology and counseling appeal to you?\nThe power of clinical psychology, in my experience, is that it helps each individual develop insights, mindful perspectives, and tools  to reconnect with others, in one way or another. Sometimes, all it takes is a little company during these developmental changes. I believe we need others on our journeys of self-discovery. I feel privileged that people let me join them on their ride.\nJohanna Lane, Writer in Residence\nWhat is your favorite novel and why?\nI would say it is “Through the Lighthouse” by Virginia Woolf, and she is one of my favorite writers. I think it is her best novel, and she really influenced the way that I wrote my book, Black Lake. In “Through the Lighthouse,” the mother, who you have been following through the whole novel, dies, but she dies in parentheses. I really loved the idea that she just didn’t get melodramatic about her death. There was a death I had in my book that I handled similarly.\nWhat classes do you teach?\nI teach two classes: a poetry workshop and a fiction workshop.\nWhat made you want to teach at Andover?\nAndover is very unusual, because there are a lot of fellowships for writers that have not yet published their first book. And there are fellowships for people who are further along in their career. So it was the perfect thing for me to do right now and I am incredibly lucky that they picked me.\nJermaine Matheson, Instructor in History\nWhat classes do you teach?\nThis term I am teaching History 300, but next term and in the spring I will teach History 200 as well.\nWhat is your favorite time period in history?\nMy favorite time period in history is actually what my class is studying right now. I really enjoy the Constitution, this era and the writing of the document. In terms of my background, I am a political scientist, so I love politics and the structure of government.\nWhat was your experience like with history as a student?\nAs a student I never thought that I would teach. I remember really liking my history teacher – my history teacher is the one that pushed me to become a teacher myself. There are certain teachers that I had as a high school and college student that really stand out to me, and most of them taught history. In high school I did not particularly like the subject, but as I got older, I got to see and appreciate how amazing and powerful the discipline is.\nJadrian Miles, Instructor in Math, Statistics and Computer Science\nWhat’s your favorite unit to teach in computer science?\nI’m really bad at picking favorites. I enjoy doing data structures and I’m going to be teaching a combined data structure and algorithm class in the spring, that’s something I have a lot of experiences with.\nWhat brought you to Andover?\nI was really impressed when I came in to talk, had wonderful conversations, I sat in on some classes and I was really impressed. Also, I believe that my kind of educational mission is well served by working with younger students, I want to see a lot more people feeling invited to studying computer science even if they don’t want to do it for their lives. It’s such a powerful field of study, it’s such a powerful set of ideas and skills to just apply to anything and so I want students who are interested in social justice or political theory or ancient greek history and everything else to come and take computer science.\nWhat is your favorite Commons food?\nI’ve been loving the salad bar. I’m also mostly vegetarian and as a New Englander, when I tried to go vegetarian a few years ago I just couldn’t give up shellfish, I felt as if i was betraying my culture and so I really liked the fact that last night at dinner there were clams. I love clams and there aren’t a lot of cafeterias with clams.\nJessica Pierre, Paid Intern in Graham House\nWhat are your roles on campus?\nI am a Graham House Counseling Intern and really excited to be here this year. Currently, I’m in my 5th and final year of a clinical psychology doctoral program at William James College.\nWhat is your favorite part about working in Graham House?\nI love working with young people. My favorite part in particular is connecting with and getting to know students. I also enjoy the rewarding feeling in knowing that I helped a student reach insights and learn new helpful coping/stress management strategies. Furthermore, it’s a pleasure to also have the chance to learn from students about their experiences. You all have been so helpful in orienting me to Andover and showing me the ropes.\nWhat is your favorite aspect of campus so far?\nSo far, I’m really appreciating the great-quality food at the Commons. You can find me there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have no issue with waiting in the long lines for a stir fry dish once in awhile. It’s so delicious! I’m also enjoying getting to learn more about Andover’s rich culture and long history.\nHijoo Son, Instructor in History\nWhat are the courses that you are currently teaching?\nThis year I’m teaching History 100, 300 and a senior elective in the spring on Asian History.\nDid you have any prior teaching experiences before Andover?\nYes, I taught at Exeter for two years, and before that I was teaching at a university for about 5 years. I have about 20 years of teaching experience.\nWhat inspired you to teach in general?\nI believe that students are the future. I love teaching. I teach history to get to know more about where I come from. I was a history major undergrad, and completed my graduate studies so it’s something that i have a passion for.\nWhat are your other passions besides history?\nCooking! I love cooking all food: asian food, barbeques, everything. I just cooked last night in fact– smoked baby back ribs and some salad.\nRanbel Sun, Instructor in Physics\nWhat about the Andover campus appealed to you?\nDefinitely the students. You guys are just on a whole other level. Students here are driven and motivated. They’re also very curious. Today I had a student who didn’t get to fully finish her lab during our lab period and even though it wasn’t required for her to finish, she came back after school just because she wanted to see if it works.I think that’s just a characteristic of students here. It’s hard to find elsewhere.\nWhat inspired you to teach?\nI guess I’ve always liked learning and I think when you like learning, you also like being able to share that with other people. That’s where teaching comes in. It’s fun to be able to see from other perspectives, where the students are coming from. My background is in engineering and I like to think of it as debugging students’ brains in terms of what they’re thinking.\nWhich courses are you teaching?\nPhysics 400 and 550.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nIn hopes of encouraging students to get more sleep, Head of School John Palfrey issued a challenge to the Andover student body, challenging them to sleep for as many or more hours than he will during the month of October.\n“Can you get more sleep than I do? You are challenged: for the month of October, log your nightly sleep using any form of tracking — on a gadget or on a plain sheet of paper, it doesn’t matter.  The honor system governs.  I will also track my amount of sleep on a daily basis,” wrote Palfrey in an email to the student body.\nAlthough data collected through surveys by the administration office suggests Andover students are the most stressed during the fall terms, Palfrey hopes students can focus equally on their own well-being and restfulness as well as academics.\n“I thought that now would be a great time to focus on  [students’] well-being and also on focusing on myself and making sure that I get enough sleep. This competition just has to do with our emphasis on well-being and the fact that I believe that excellence in academics and other aspects of life can be consistent with getting enough sleep,” said Palfrey in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThis competition was devised as part of the Empathy and Balance pillar from the Strategic Plan, a curriculum focusing on the promotion of health, community and well-being.\n“I actually think that if you start with sleep and then you build other things around it, that is the path to success, whether it’s a matter of sports, athletics, academics or arts,” said Palfrey.\nStudents who plan on participating are required to hand in a sleep log to Palfrey’s office by the first week of November. The students who slept as much or more as Palfrey will get to receive one of multiple $25 gift cards and will be entered in a raffle to win a new FitBit.\n“[Getting more sleep] is something I work on all the time. I have a very busy job that pulls me in lots of different directions, but I feel like I perform better in every way if I’ve gotten at least eight hours of sleep so that’s my goal for this month, to get 8 hours of better sleep,” said Palfrey.\nAt the end of the month, a celebration featuring healthy food will be hosted for all students who have participated in the challenge.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nLast spring, while Lani Silversides, Instructor in Mathematics, hosted a group playdate for her daughter with other elementary school girls, she began to photograph the children while they played. Bringing out footballs and baseball bats, she attempted to capture the moment of the children frolicking on the Great Lawn.\n“I was able to show them, through photographs, that it’s okay to be you [and to] just come in your most comfortable clothes to just play and be active,” said Silversides.\nThe photos she took that day became the basis of a book called “My Strong is Beautiful” that Silversides released last spring. She said she wrote the book to inspire girls to be active.\nNow, as a continuation of the “My Strong is Beautiful” project,  Silversides has created a new program called “Strong Girls,” which she hopes will help spark an early love for sports and physical activity in girls that will carry on into teenage years.\n“[The program is an extension] from my book that I had written in the spring. [In the book] is a photo of a girl in action and a rhyming verse that goes with it. It’s all ‘I Can.’ I can run, I can jump, I can leap, I can climb. The sort of ‘tagline’ of this program is ‘I Can,’ ” said Silversides.\nThe program, which starts on October 14, emphasizes the importance of establishing a supportive and fun environment for girls to learn new skills and to build self-esteem, confidence and pride, according to Silversides.\n“I’m going to teach them how to do a plank. And with that, we’ll also have a karate day. It connects core strength with karate. So, I’m going to teach them something new with some karate stances,” said Silversides.\nShe continued, “The life skill [that the girls will learn] is going to be something new. That’s something they can learn through the activity [they are doing] and for many of them, that’s a new thing… They’ll learn about teamwork without being told, ‘This is teamwork.’”\nSilversides founded “Strong Girls” after she saw her young daughter, along with other children, begin to suppress the active and physical side of their personalities.\n“I watched my own daughter and friends trying to navigate through some subtle discouragement that girls can face socially with respect to sports and being active, I decided to do something about it to show them all they can be strong and proud,” wrote Silversides in an email to The Phillipian.\nSilversides hopes to eventually expand this program beyond Andover and elementary girls.\n“Over the summer, I realized I really wanted to put everything into action in some way and I came up with this. It’s local right now, but my vision is to create a curriculum that would be accessible to other schools and other people,” said Silversides.\nThis year, Silversides’ Strong Girls program will be featured in the “Learning Lab” after school program at Bancroft Elementary School, which is sponsored by the school’s Parent Teacher Organization. The program will be available to kindergarten through second grade girls once a week for six weeks.\n“[The program is] something that I think everyone can connect to. You might have a sister, a cousin, an aunt, a mom. It doesn’t have to be a girl who connects to it. Many people can appreciate it because they can connect to it in someway, because they know someone who’s active, and you think ‘hey, she’d be proud of that,’” Silversides continued.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nAndover has joined Choate, Deerfield, Northfield Mount Hermon and Phillips Exeter Academy to form the Five Schools League (FSL), a new athletic league, in which five schools will compete for a championship in all interscholastic sports. The new league will not affect Andover’s status as a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference (NEPSAC).\n“The main goal is for us to have a series of like-minded schools who play one another at a very high level of competition, but where we’re joined by a set of common principles that allow for great competition,” said Head of School John Palfrey.\nAt its core, the FSL was designed to quell the hypercompetitiveness between its member schools while simultaneously recognizing the importance of athletics in students’ lives, said Leon Modeste, Athletic Director.\n“What we’re hoping is that we can lead the way for other prep schools to understand that it’s not just about hanging a banner. It’s about the regular season and how you do against like-minded competition. That’s what’s driving us,” said Modeste.\n“It’s part of [Andover’s] philosophy. We want to have competitive athletic teams, but we’re not going to let that drive who we are. We’re not going to go out and become a powerhouse in some sport just to win games,” he continued.\nTo achieve this, athletes and retiring coaches in the FSL will be recognized at the end of the season for outstanding character and sportsmanship.\n“We know that these five schools have the same philosophy on the importance of sports in an academic setting… It’s not a high-intensity thing, and we don’t want it to be. Competitive, but not crazy,” he continued.\nThe league also aims to end aggressive recruiting tactics adopted by other prep schools. All schools in the FSL discourage the act of high school coaches reaching out to student athletes before the students have begun the application process, Modeste said. One of the main tenets of the FSL is that academics come before athletics.\n“[A member school] can’t be a school that thinks, ‘We’re going to admit these ten guys so we can win a basketball championship.’ They can’t do that… None of these schools do that. Do they want to win? Sure. But they’re not going to compromise their academic integrity just to win games,” said Modeste.\nAll sports will be a part of the FSL, which will name one school as the overall champion in recognition of having the strongest athletic program each year. Wins for all teams will count the same toward the year-end tally (for instance, a victory for Varsity Soccer would be worth the same amount of points for the winning school as a victory for Junior Varsity Soccer).\n“We get our kids, and we try to make them the best student athletes that we can make them, with our coaches. These other four schools feel the same way. These are schools that we have had longstanding relationships with,” said Modeste.\nThe headmasters of the participating schools have been discussing the formation of the FSL since 1998. Being part of the FSL will not result in any schedule changes for teams, nor will there be any playoffs for the league.\n“From my end, I’m extremely excited about this. It’s something I’ve wanted to set up since I got here, and I’m thrilled that another four schools have joined us in this,” said Palfrey.\nFurther, the FSL will allow any school with the same goals to join the league, said Modeste.\n“It’d be great if there are schools out there that could join this [league], as long as they have the same academic and athletic philosophy,” he added.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nOn a seemingly typical Wednesday morning, students flocked to Cochran Chapel, anticipating an All-School Meeting (ASM) dedicated to a documentary about President George H.W. Bush ’42 and its executive producer, Mary Kate Cary. As students settled down, Head of School John Palfrey stood before an audience of unsuspecting students and introduced Cary, a former speechwriter for Bush. Then, he welcomed two surprise guests onto stage: the 41st President of the United States and the former First Lady, Barbara Bush.\nStudents, faculty and staff gasped, standing up to cheer for 91-year-old Bush and the former First Lady as they emerged from behind the stage.\n“Thank you for that warm Andover welcome back to the school that has meant so much to me in my life,” said Bush, waving to the audience. It was his first visit to campus since 2003, when he gave a keynote speech at Andover’s 225th anniversary.\nOnce the students settled down, Cary introduced her film, titled “41on41,” which depicts 41 stories from 41 perspectives on President Bush. She selected five clips from the film to present to the Andover community.\n“The reason I am here is because over the years, I heard a tremendous number of stories about [President Bush] and his character and his good humor, as well as his life of service,” said Cary.\nThe documentary began with the reading of a poem that Dorothy Walker Bush, President Bush’s mother, inscribed in his Bible before he departed for Andover. The scene featured various interviewees, who each recited a line of the poem that they thought best represented President Bush. This poem served as the narrative arc of the documentary as it exemplifies Bush’s character.\nThe film featured President Bush’s service to the country, including his decision to enlist in the Navy the day he turned during 18 (which was also the day he graduated from Andover) during World War II.  He was the nation’s youngest Naval Aviator at the time.\n“The decision he made at Andover to serve his country was the beginning of a lifetime of public service to our country. Whether that [means] serving in the military… or serving in publicly elected office, or starting one of the largest nonprofits in the world, he has lived a life of public service that began at Andover,” said Cary.\nBush received Andover’s two highest honors, the Claude Moore Fuess Award in 1981 and the the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction in 2012 in recognition of his public service and global leadership.\nAfter ASM, the seven recipients of the George Herbert Walker Bush Scholarship enjoyed a private lunch with the former President and First Lady, along with Palfrey and Richard Phelps ’46, who was one of Bush’s baseball teammates at Andover. The scholarship was established in 2002 by the Board of Trustees to honor President Bush, and is awarded to students of high academic achievement who possess qualities of outstanding character and leadership potential, according to the Andover website.\nThe seven students chatted about the past and present of Andover, sports and current events.\nDuring his opening remarks, Bush said,  “It always gives me great joy to return to Andover. The lessons learned and the relationships forged here have meant so much throughout my full and adventurous life, and I could wish nothing more for every student who is so blessed to walk on this campus.”\nBush, who broke his neck in July and has had to wear a neck brace since, made the trip from his home in Kennebunkport, ME.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Oct 2, 2015'), ('\nBrittany Amano ’16, a Post-Graduate from Honolulu, Hawaii, is no stranger to hunger. As a child growing up with her single mom and grandmother, she often relied on local food banks and arrived home after school hungry, Amano told The Phillipian. Inspired by the difficulties she and her family experienced, Amano founded “The Future Isn’t Hungry,” a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising money and resources for youth experiencing poverty and homelessness in America, as a 12-year-old.\n“With our family split and resources often depleted, we were often left hungry, so I knew how it felt to go to school hungry. I knew how it felt to go to the food bank and to see only unhealthy foods there. I knew how it felt to go to school without new school supplies or a brand new pair of shoes and I knew how it felt to not celebrate Christmas. All of these personal experiences caused me to start [the organization] at a young age,” said Amano.\nAmano began by collecting donations from her neighborhood, prompting her community to help raise money and resources. Through a project called “Friday Food Bags,” Amano helped students from low-income families bring a bag of food home each Friday, which provided these families with sufficient nutritious food for the weekend.\n“When most of us are looking forward to breaks and going home, a lot of those kids are dreading it because they are worrying about where their next meal would be coming from… The main difference between us and a regular food bank is that one, it is completely youth-run and second, we are all about healthy and balanced food,” said Amano.\nWhile the main goal of the organization is to prevent hunger, “The Future Isn’t Hungry” also promotes literacy in youth living in low-income households, homeless shelters and foster homes. Furthermore, the nonprofit works with corporate sponsors such as the Jefferson Awards, the N.F.L. and GenerationOn to provide school supply kits, Christmas presents and brand new shoes that enable students enter each new school year with confidence.\nJust three years after its establishment, Amano’s organization has branched out to all 50 states and will have helped nearly 650,000 people  by December 2015. Amano received the prestigious Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service by a person under the age of 25 in the category of hunger and poverty in June.\n“I have been traveling the world ever since [I was 14] to share my message, to encourage other youths across the country to get involved and to teach them that you are never too young to make a difference. I do that by sharing my personal story about how I did it,” said Amano. “You don’t need the money, the power, the connections. You just need the will to make a difference.”\nDespite her successful work as a young entrepreneur, Amano expressed regret for missing out on some typical high school experiences.\n“I never really had the experience of going to a full week of classes… and I knew that when I go to college this year, I knew I wouldn’t be used to going from traveling around the country to actually going to school. So Andover gave me the opportunity to be a normal high school student for a year,” said Amano.\nDuring her remaining year at Andover, Amano hopes to explore and pursue new passions that she did not have the chance to consider when focusing on expanding her nonprofit organization.\n“I am excited to come to Andover and take a break from traveling the country to speak at conferences and be a normal kid. I’m especially looking forward to attending my first school dance, joining clubs and sports and actually being able to attend class continuously,” said Amano.\nIn addition to being the founder of “The Future Isn’t Hungry,” Amano is also the recipient of the 40 under 40 Award, given by “Pacific Business News,” and Running Start Women to Watch.

She is a crystallographer who worked with some other chemist – I think it was Alan Turing – to solve the crystal structure of vitamin B12. On top of that, she also discovered that you could, in fact, have a bond between a metal and a carbon, which was one of the biggest discoveries of the mid-20th century.\nWhat are your roles on campus?\nI am a complement House Counselor in Morton House. There are seven girls in the dorm, and I think they’re nice to hang out with. I also coach Instructional Squash with Tom Hodgson.\nLaila Ballout, Instructor in History\nWhat is your favorite historical figure?\nFrom an interesting perspective there is a guy, called Walid Jumblatt, and he was a warlord in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War. He he is still a politician. I think he looks like a cartoon – he’s got a lot of crazy hairs that fly around. He is definitely someone who survives against all odds. So he is a contemporary historical figure, but a very interesting character in politics and in Lebanese history.\nWhat do you like most about the Andover campus?\nIt is gorgeous, that is for sure. It is also really calm, even when there are a lot of students. It seems like there is a sort of studious and peaceful atmosphere.\nAnny Candelario, Instructor in Math\nWhat made you choose Andover?\nMy husband got a Spanish position here first, and there were no math openings, which bummed me out. I actually started looking at Lawrence High but then this July, a math position opened up. I thought it would be an amazing place to work at because my husband works here, and I had already heard about the caliber of the students here, as well as the serious academic focus. At the same time, I’d be able to work with people who I could learn so much from, so I thought that was exciting.\nWhat’s your favorite part of teaching math?\nMy favorite part about teaching math (210 and 320) is searching for that “aha” moment in students. They’re able to make a connection with the content, the approach and the result. It doesn’t even have anything to do with academic ability persay, but rather, persistence and grit and not giving up. As a math teacher, I have the pleasure of teaching a subject that many inherently believe to be very difficult. I like to push back on that perception and facilitate a lesson where the students feel confident, not necessarily about getting all the answers, but also about making mistakes.\nCarol Artacho, Instructor in Physics\nWhat are your favorite physicists in history?\nThe early astronomers from the 18th and 19th century, as well as women who actually decided to scientifically start cataloging the sky and their observations. So I like the idea of women defying the demand of society, and I find that really inspiring. It really speaks to me at a personal level.\nWhy did you want to become a teacher at Andover?\nWhen I came to visit, I was really taken by how driven and how thoughtful the students were. I remember watching this astronomy class where the teacher wasn’t actually there that day because she was ill. So the students actually took over and talked about all of their subjects and what they had been doing. I was really taken by their enthusiasm and their learning. I very much enjoyed that and thought I would really like to be part of it.\nLeon Calleja, Instructor in English\nWhat do you like most about the English language?\nI think it’s quirky and very rich. One has the ability to make different intonations. I think I love its rhythms. English is just a very complicated languag: it’s just something I am attracted to from a very philosophical standpoint, but also an aesthetic standpoint.\nWhat was experience like as an English student?\nBack in high school, I wasn’t the strongest English student at all. I remember the first time I tried to get into an advanced English class, I wasn’t actually allowed to, but my mom pushed the administration and I got in. I ended up going – not the greatest in the class, but I did much better than they would have expected. That actually led to a recommendation from the teacher, which probably got me into the college that I ended up attending.\nEdwin Escobar, Instructor in Spanish\nWhat is the hardest part of teaching Spanish?\nFinding a starting point with a class. You have to get a feel from where a lot of students come from with different backgrounds of Spanish. Some have taken three years, some have taken eight years. It’s a matter of finding a good starting point so that nobody’s left behind.\nDo you have a favorite unit to teach?\nI’ve always liked the beginning [Spanish 100] courses and teaching about hobbies. You get to really learn a lot about the students and what they like doing. When you move into Spanish 200 classes, you focus a little bit more about grammar and all that stuff. I think learning about the student is definitely what I enjoy most about teaching Spanish.\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2015'), ('\nH.U.A.C.A\nAndover students in the Human Understanding through Archaeology and Cultural Awareness (HUACA) program, visited sites such as Machu Picchu, Chavín de Huántar, Huaca de la Luna and Cerro Sechín as part of archaeological exploration and linguistic and cultural immersion in Peru.\nFor 18 days, students home-stayed in an indigenous Peruvian village and went on a four day hike to Machu Picchu.\n“My favorite part had to be the four day hike we did on the Inca trail. We spent the last day in Machu Picchu…We got see a lot of archaeological sites in the first week, which was an absolutely amazing experience to be able to see amazing structures and temples,” said Alana Gudinas ’16.\nDuring the trip students interacted and met many of the locals. Gudinas found this aspect of the program especially meaningful.\n“I think as a person who has never traveled outside the country before, the way I most benefited from this [trip] is, to put it simply, learning from the cultural exchange with the kids from the local community, where a lot of them descended from the Incas,” said Gudinas.\n“I don’t speak much Spanish, but I was still able to connect so fully to the kids our age from the local community. I learned that signs of friendship and love are universal, all you have to do is make up your mind, and not make assumptions, and you can form bonds with anyone,” she continued.\nPiette Program\nWhile certain French immersion programs may firmly ground their students in Paris, the Piette Program took students from all levels of study on a journey across the entire country. Making stops in Paris, Normandy and the South of France, a group of 12 students absorbed all that the country had to offer, from the Loire Valley to Monet’s Gardens.\nEach location focused on a different theme: culture in Paris, history in Normandy and prehistory in the South, where students inspected cave paintings and participated in archeological surveys.\n“[The program] was so much more than just learning French. I don’t know when else I’d be able to do an archeological survey, much less in the south of France,” said Sophie Miller ’18, a current FREN-220 student.\nLed by Ryan Wheeler, Director of the Robert S. Peabody Museum, Claire Gallou and Debra Pickering, Instructors in French, the group explored their own relations to the country and its culture.\n“When we were in Versailles, we figured out that there was still a king living in Versailles named Louis when [Andover] was started. That was just something we figured out. It overlaps. The trip was all about finding where you fit into this history,” said Miller.\nThe students were required to blog about their experiences and choose an aspect of the trip on which to prepare a “Focus Project” that they would present at Parent’s Weekend in October.\nPecos Pathways\nContinuing a tradition since 1998, the Robert S. Peabody Museum offered 3 Andover students the opportunity to travel to the Pecos National Historical Park in New Mexico. For three weeks, the students traveled together to learn about the ancestral and contemporary native communities in the region, with a focus on archaeology.\nFor the first week, Alexa Pagano ’16, Karissa Kang ’17, and Makenna Marshall ’18 worked with Jemez Pueblo tribal elders and local students to learn more about the town’s culture and history.\nStaying at the Pueblo with her host family during the first week proved to be a high point of the program for Pagano.\n“One night, I stayed up with my host mom until like two in the morning, just cooking enchiladas with her. [My host family] had to go to a feast day the next day, and they were selling enchiladas at the festival, so I helped her out,” she said.\nThe students relocated to a small town near Santa Fe on the second week to live in a KOA campground, a company with over 400 camp sites nationwide. The group spent much of their time outdoors participating in excavations, taking hikes and visiting parks, in hopes of gaining new archeological and historical knowledge.\nFor the final leg of their journey, Andover and Jemez students visited New England to visit the excavation of a sunken ship, while staying at Brooks.\nRussian Language\nLeaving the warm summers of America and entering the blustery climate of Eastern Europe, 12 Andover students embarked on a three-week immersion program in Petrozavodsk, Russia. Acclimating to a community in which no one understood English proved to be quite difficult for even the most confident of students.\n“We lived with host families. I [lived] with a 65 year old woman and no one else. She didn’t speak English. Other people had [bigger] families, with fathers, mothers, grandfathers and siblings. People had very varied experiences, but no one spoke English,” said Jack Lawlor ’17, who had only taken Russian for two years when he signed up for the program.\nFor Sasha Newton ’16, the immersion experienced exposed her to lessons that were not traditionally taught in a classroom.\n“I [learned] idiomatic expressions… that you might not use in the classroom – slang terms that you don’t know or wouldn’t learn,” she said.\nStudents built their language skills by attending classes taught by Russian college students. Highlights of the trip included visiting the Church of the Savior on Blood, exploring the site of Alexander II’s death and attending the St. Petersburg Opera, where students watched the Barber of Seville entirely in Russian.\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2015'), ('\nAlexander Djamoos, Teaching Fellow in Russian, trekked up Mt. Kilimanjaro during the summer of 2014, with a group of volunteers and children with disabilities. He was also born with a disability that prevented him from being able to walk. After a six-day hike, he and his group reached the top of the mountain and watched the sunset.\n“My hands were bleeding because I crawled half the way. Come to think of it, it was also the biggest mental challenge I’ve had to overcome,” said Djamoos.\nThe group Djamoos was travelling with was from Happy Families, an adoption agency and organization that seeks to bring Russian children with disabilities to the United States for orthopaedic treatments and to raise money for orphanages in Russia. Djamoos’s own adoption was aided by Happy Families.\nLast summer was not Djamoos’s first attempt to hike Mt. Kilimanjaro. His first attempt was three years ago, but the summer of 2014 marked his first successful trip to the summit.\n“Physically, [the hike] was probably the biggest challenge I’ve had to overcome. It was easily the most gruelling thing I’ve done… There would be times when I would take my [prosthetic] legs off and just crawl on the ground and be bitten by ants and various other things… It was so dangerous and so out of my comfort zone, [but] I wanted to do it,” said Djamoos.\nDjamoos was born in the small town of Nizhny Lomov, Russia, and spent his childhood in an orphanage. He was born with physical disabilities that left him unable to walk until he received orthopaedic treatment at the age of 16.\n“For me, home is where my friends are, and I have friends almost everywhere. I would say I have multiple homes. It is nice to go back to Russia. I go visit my orphanage almost every year, and I go back to just remind myself where I came from,” said Djamoos.\nAt the age of 16, Djamoos came to Dallas, TX., for his orthopaedic treatment and surgery and to attend high school. He then attended University of Texas, where he majored in political science and foreign relations. This topic started to interest him during his time working for the Happy Families organization in Russia.\n“I’ve been dealing with the Russian media as a representative of [Happy Families]. Sometimes we have politicians who come to our meetings and our fundraisers so that’s how I got interested in the political world of Russia. I also am interested in seeing how Russian politics juxtaposes with politics in the United States,” said Djamoos.\nWhile working on his thesis in Russian media during the summer of 2014, Djamoos interned at “Kommersant,” a Russian newspaper devoted to politics and business.\n“I was working on my thesis in Russian media and whether it was propaganda or not, so I wanted to know what it was like being a journalist. I did it so I could write a good thesis, and I think it’s important to experience whatever you’re writing about. It’s fairly dangerous to be a journalist [in Russia] nowadays, especially if you are critical of the government. It’s dangerous to be an objective journalist,” said Djamoos.\nAt Andover, Djamoos teaches RUSS-200 and RUSS-600. He also serves as a House Counselor in Stearns House and Advisor to the Philomathean Society.

Names such as the “OWHL Nest,” “Casa de Creation” and “Open Innovation Lab (OIL)” proved to be the most popular.\nMichael Barker, Director of Academy Research, Information and Library Services, Caroline Nolan, Director of the Tang Institute, Eric Roland, the Tang Institute Precourt Director for Partnerships, Alex Davenport ’17 and John Koobatian ’17, Co-Presidents of Makers Club and Erin McCloskey, Associate Director of Educational Initiatives, introduced the new Makerspace.\n“What we think is really valuable about this space is that there are so many aspects of what it means to be a maker. Pretty much everyone has something that they can contribute to make,” said McCloskey.\nStudents ate pizza while exploring the new additions to the space, which included 3-D printers, laser and vinyl cutters, a dry-erase wall and spinning chairs. The event introduced students to clubs such as Blueprint, Launchpad and Makers Club, all of which will be active users of the Makerspace.\nDavenport said, “We have a lot more resources and a space where we can really bring our club to life. Before, we were just a few people in a classroom in Gelb. We didn’t really have a big following… I think now people know that they have the tools to really flesh out their ideas and bring the ideas to life.”\nAlthough the Makerspace will be used by many science and technology clubs, students are encouraged to visit and get to know both the new space and its tools.\nCindy Espinosa ’18 said, “I’m really into innovation. I think providing a space like this to kids will really open the door to new ideas. Honestly, even if you’re just interested, I think it’s a really cool learning space.”\nThe Makers Club will soon be implementing a queue system for the 3-D printer, that will allow multiple projects to be sent to the printer at once and then executed in their order of arrival. The queue system would be in the form of a website similar to that of Andover’s wireless printing initiative, Print On. The space will host events such as a Makers Club Hack-A-Thon, as well as lessons in ideation to help students use the new technology, despite possible intimidation they might feel if they are new to such projects.\nBarker said, “It’s pretty user friendly. Andover students have proven that they can learn things pretty quickly but we also have a whole club, as well as the techmasters club, dedicated to helping kids learn… If kids want to learn how to use a 3-D printer and they don’t know how, they should just come here and there will be someone to help them figure it out.”\nAs the event drew to a close, Barker handed out memo books to attendees, encouraging students to brainstorm ideas that could benefit the Andover community. “What would you do if you could do something tomorrow?” said Barker. “What do you want to do to make our community better?”\nThe opening took place in the basement of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library on Wednesday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Sep 25, 2015'), ('\nSeveral fireworks were set off last Saturday on the Great Lawn at 11:05 p.m..

The decision by non-professional individuals to set off fireworks on our campus is illegal, misguided, reckless, irresponsible, unsafe and unacceptable,” wrote Elliott.\nIn the email, Elliott highlighted the dangers of fireworks, including statistics of fires caused by fireworks, along with information about other firework-related injuries.\n“Whether it’s fingers, hands or parts of bodies that have been permanently damaged – if not destroyed – by fireworks, the risk is real. Talk to any doctor who knows how scary [these risks are],” said Elliott in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“I am really troubled by the decision-making by a group of students… I really do hope students realize the severity of this act and how unsafe it is for our community – just how irresponsible and misguided this decision making is,” she continued.\nElliott requests the Andover community to come forward and share information regarding the students who set off the fireworks.\n“We’re engaged in conversation with students, and kids are coming forward with some information.

This dialogue must honor each one of you and set you on a course of healthy relationships during your time here and for the rest your entire life,” said Palfrey.\nPalfrey emphasized the necessity of mutual respect within a community such as Andover, in which students hold various religious beliefs, moral values and family backgrounds.\n“Being excellent as a student [at Andover] means caring, respecting one another and being in partnership with one another – not despite our diversity, but in keeping with it,” said Palfrey. “This diversity means that you will come to any relationship with potentially very different beliefs about what is morally right with the other person.”\nAlthough Palfrey clarified that sexual activity is not encouraged on campus, he added, “Some aspects of this topic are clear and obvious; others are a bit more complex.”\nIn the category of “clear,” he included Andover’s zero tolerance policy for sexual assault, Massachusetts’s required age of consent and the “yes means yes” policy that has become a part of Andover’s disciplinary policies this year.\n“We cannot and do not tolerate sexual assault at Andover,” said Palfrey during ASM.  “If anyone is unclear on that topic, let me know. If you are worried that what you engaged in is sexual assault, then stop. If you have experienced something that you wonder was sexual assault, seek help. If you don’t know what I mean, what I am talking about, please find someone to talk about it with, whether or not [it] be me or someone on this stage today.”\nA subtle point he mentioned was that conversations about sexual relationships should not be exclusively heteronormative. Palfrey warned students against letting stereotypes surrounding different sexual expectations and power dynamics between varying genders dominate such important conversations.\n“Everyone has a right to feel safe and respected on this campus regardless of your age, your gender, your sexual orientation, your moral perspective or your faith. As many of you have pointed out, too many students, here at Andover as elsewhere in the world, have suffered from unwanted sexual encounters,” said Palfrey.\nFollowing Palfrey’s speech, Jennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, concluded ASM with a call for conversation regarding sexual assault and violence, highlighting the seriousness with which Andover faculty is taking such topics.\n“I know this can be daunting, but we are here for you. The entire faculty is gathered here and in Kemper as a show of our shared commitment to you and to your safety. We care about you and we will engage with you in these conversations,” said Elliott.\nAlso on stage were Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English, and Tasha Hawthorne, Instructor in English, both of whom are Co-Directors of the Brace Center and members of the Community Conduct Council (CCC), as well as Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director of Isham Health Center and Carol Israel, Director of Graham House Counseling Center. These faculty members were present to represent the faculty as a whole and to demonstrate the faculty’s support of students by engaging in further discussion on sexual health.\n“In the coming days and weeks, I hope you will heed our call to conversation,” said Elliott. “In dormitories, you will be discussing healthy relationships, affirmative consent and campus resources. In advising, you will engage in the same issues. In your friend groups, initiate these conversations. On your sports teams and with your clubs, promote these conversations. As faculty, we are here to support you in these efforts.”\nTo open up more discussion on sexual assault, the school will divide into small, mixed-gender groups to partake in a workshop for both students and faculty.

They examined topics such as abuse, sexual violence and bullying. The seminars, the first of which occurred last Saturday, will continue throughout the Fall and Winter Terms.\nDuring these seminars, mentors from the MVP program will lead the students through possible dangerous scenarios, such as underage drinking, and offer some ways to deal with each one. These seminars will be hosted in two separate groups during Saturday mornings. After completing MVP, participating Lowers will serve as representatives of the program, passing their knowledge onto their peers.\nA participant in the program, Sparky Yoo ’18 said, “I think it is really cool that after this program, we will become mentors for students [by teaching them] more about the causes and how we should react to violence or abuse when we see it happen.”\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, Tracy Ainsworth, last year’s Brace Center Director, and Leon Modeste, Athletic Director, pioneered the program’s installation with the goal of educating volunteer Lowers on how to respond appropriately to sexual assault.\nModeste said, “Being [an active bystander means] if I see someone doing something wrong, I’m not going to just not engage in it myself. I am going to tell that person to not do that. We want these young men and women to spread the word to their class, to the school, about how you can avoid those kinds of situation where nobody is saying stop.”\nLast Saturday marked the first session of the MVP program at Andover. Both early-morning and late-morning groups met for two and a half hours for introductory workshops.\nMekedas Belayneh ’18, a participant in the program, said, “In the last class we played a game to get to know each other called ‘Calling All My Neighbors’. The idea of the game was to say a phrase that someone could relate to, then that person would hook arms with you. This continued until we made a full circle. The point of the game was to really show how we are all connected in some ways and that there are issues that affect all of us.”\nAccording to the Northeastern University MVP website, the program “Motivates athletes and leaders to play a central role in solving problems that historically have been considered women’s issues.”\nLowers were the targeted grade for the program because they are the youngest members of upperclassmen dorms and will remain at Andover for another three years.\nAlexandra Macrides ’18, a student participant in the program, said, “I am a new student this year so I am already astounded by the amount of open discussion [on] campus and the mutual respect between peers and faculty here. For me, the MVP program is going to have the biggest impact on my life back at home. I am excited to have all this new knowledge and to be able to go home and be a leader and educator in my other community.”\nLast year, the same participants of the MVP program came to campus to host a seminar on being an active bystander for Andover faculty members as well as educators from other schools. Noting the success of the program among the faculty, Modeste, Elliott and Ainsworth worked to have the MVP program open to all students as well.\nThomas MacWilliams ’18 said, “The skills [we learn in this program] are really good tools to have [while] going through life at Andover. Andover isn’t a perfect place and this kind of [abuse] does happen, so it is really about how you react when you are in a situation where you see things that could potentially get worse.”\nModeste said, “We liked the [mentors] and the message, also we like that they’re young people who would relate well to our students. They do the seminar all on their own –we don’t sit there with them. Our kids liked it and the people liked our kids.

Over the course of ten days, the group traveled from Missouri to Alabama, visiting important locations like Montgomery, Selma, and Memphis.\nFaculty chaperones Allen Grimm, instructor in theater; Damany Fisher, instructor in history; and Judith Wombwell, instructor in dance, led the group on an in depth look at the start of an integral movement in American history.\nTouring sites such as the Lorraine Motel (the site of the famed activist’s assassination), and the Southern Poverty Law Center, students gained a deeper understanding of the lasting effects of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and landmark court decisions that passed during the movement. A surprising stop to some was the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, one of the birthplaces of African-American music–most notably soul.\n“When you think of civil rights, you don’t think of music, but actually, one of the things this trip sort of explained was how different types of media came together during the movement, and how artists during this movement used what they had in their arsenal in order to talk about what was going on for the rest of their people,” said Zach Ruffin ’17.\n“I was never big on history, but I know the civil rights era is really important to pretty much everyone. It marks a change in how people from different viewpoints would eventually come to learn that. People fought to make themselves known, which was very important for everyone to realize. Everyone has a place in the world, no matter how corny that sounds,” he added.\nBASK in ASK\nBASK in ASK (Beijing Andover Shanghai Kunming in Andover Summer Kunming) program uses a multidisciplinary and multicultural approach to focus on a pair of environmental issues critical to both China and the U.S: climate change and water issues. Andover students partnered with Chinese students from partner schools to participate in this intensive 3-week program in Kunming, China.\nStudents in the program learned about water scarcity, quality and quantity. They took classes in economics, social philosophy, language and culture, and visited water filtration facilities, a rose nursery and local lakes to gain a better understanding of the water issues facing China. Students also bonded through daily activities such as, sports, tai chi, and yoga.\nAndover students paired with the Chinese students, with whom they studied and shared their perspectives on topics discussed throughout the program.\n“Being able to work through complicated issues in biology, all the subjects that [my partner and I] talked about together, was probably my favorite part of BASK. Working through these issues and seeing it from the two different perspectives that we each brought, one from a Chinese education and one from an American education was a very interesting,” said Joel Peña ’16.\nFor Gherardo Morona ’17, the program has helped him become more aware of stereotypical biases in the media.\n“I realized that lot of the articles that I read about China [in the United States], about its economy, politics, etc. has a lot of information that could be true but a lot of it could also be said from a stereotypical standpoint, and I think that after going to BASK…has been beneficial in allowing me to look at these articles published in the US with a more critical standpoint.” said Morona ’17.\nBerlin History, Culture and Language Week\nFor a week, twelve students transformed the city of Berlin into a classroom, exploring its art, architecture, and historical monuments to gain a better understanding of German culture and history. During the trip, students frequently traversed the city on their bicycles, engaging in conversations with locals along the way and improving their lingual skills.\n“It definitely helped me with my German oral skills, because even though you do that during class, it’s really different being in Germany, using it on a regular basis and in conversation. I definitely learned the local language, instead of just regular grammatical things,” said Madison Pettaway ’17.\n“I thoroughly enjoyed the day trips we took as a class; however, the time we spent on our own, whether for ten minutes or for the night, was the most valuable to me. It was special to use what we have been learning for the past two years and finally get a chance to use it with no dictionary or teacher to fall back on,” said Payton Jancsy ‘16 in an email to The Phillipian.\nOver the course of the week, the group visited numerous cultural landmarks, including the DDR Museum, Humboldt Forum, and the Topography of Terror Documentation Center. According to Pettaway, however, the highlight of the trip was visiting the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The somber atmosphere of the monument provided context and perspective about the Holocaust that history books could not replicate.\n“Just going there was so heartbreaking. Actually seeing the stelae which represented the ashes of the burned Jewish people, and going into the museum…There were videos streaming, but no one talked. It was amazing to see everyone caught up in it, because in most memorials, you don’t really see that. It was really beautiful to see,” said Pettaway.\nBrazil PLACES\nTwelve students on the Brazil PLACES program visited a variety of places in Brazil, including the capital Rio de Janeiro and the Amazon rainforest, and explored the themes of sustainability, arts and indigenous culture. To examine sustainable development in Brazil, they visited a local coffee farm and a rubber tapping factory in Amazon, to name a few locations.\n“There is this rubber factory that uses the native rubber and latex, to put power, money and resources back into the community. It was really interesting because they have a whole sustainable project there.” continued Kika Weirich-Freiberg ’16.\nStudents also had the chance to explore the rainforest.\n“I met Neilson Mendez- a guy who I never thought I would find there. He lived in the Amazon forest for his whole life, and he knew basically everything about the rainforest. We learned from Mendez to take what we need, and not what we want and I thought that was really interesting,” said  Eliot Zaeder ’17 .\nAndover students also worked with students from the SESC high school, a private boarding school in Rio de Janeiro. Each year, eight SESC high school students on the Brazil PLACES program come and visit the Andover campus, and Andover students on the program visit and live on the SESC campus during the summer.\nZaeder said that he still keeps in touch with the SESC student that he hosted at Andover.\n“His name is Guilherme, and we have become really close friends.

His contributions and the legacy that he left behind, however, extend far beyond his donations to the school.\n“Mr. Underwood was the President of the Board of Trustees before I became the Head of School, but he has continued to be an active alumnus and one of the great leaders of the school, certainly of the 20th century and into the 21st,” said Head of School John Palfrey.\nAs the President of the Board from 1989 to 2004, Underwood led his team through many decisions, including the appointment of Barbara Landis Chase as the Head of School and the implementation of policy change allowing same-sex couples to serve as house counselors. The latter was an extraordinarily controversial decision at the time, and both Head of School John Palfrey and Peter Currie, President of the Board of Trustees, recalled his steadfast demeanor in handling this bold, political move.\n“I think his leadership on the topic of same sex house counselors which now seems non-controversial was extraordinarily controversial at the time and I think he was very effective in his handling in that. I think he saw it as a complex decision personally,” said Palfrey.\nAn editorial in The Phillipian the following week praised Underwood’s keen ability to “navigate our ancient ship” on such a disputed matter and his “morality” and “goodness”.\nBoth Palfrey and Currie recounted Underwood’s effective leadership in the Trustees Room.\nCurrie said, “He led with empathy, care, decisiveness and attention to the school’s founding principles. After encouraging debate and dialog from all trustees, David would bring a discussion to a close, with the issues better understood and the direction clear. ‘I think we’ve chewed all the sugar out of that gum,’ he would say, as he brought the matter to a vote,” said Currie in an article on Andover’s website.\nPrior to his appointment as President of the Board, Underwood had served as a charter trustee since 1983. In 2003, Underwood earned Andover’s highest honor, the Claude M. Fuess Award, for his service to hospitals and health care systems in the Houston area (he was a Texas native) and for his gifts supporting campus facilities. He supported numerous building and program initiatives as the chair of Campaign Andover, the largest fundraising effort among secondary schools at the time.\nPalfrey said that Underwood’s funding of the expansion of Cochran Chapel in 1997 was transformative because it ensured that the entire student body could gather in the same space at the same time. He felt that it “spoke to the needs of the community”. In addition, Underwood spearheaded the expansion of Oliver Wendell Holmes Library and the overall planning that led to the construction of Gelb Science Center.\nIn a message to classmates on their 50th reunion in 2004, Underwood said: “I have served on several boards, I have led various organizations, but nothing can ever match the experience I have had working with Andover. Nowhere could I find a more constant source of inspiration for me. I would not have traded it for anything.\nUnderwood is survived by his wife and four children.\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2015'), ('\nAccording to The Phillipian’s 2015 State of the Academy, 80 students reported having been sexually assaulted. Of these, 38 people reported having been sexually assaulted on campus. This coming year at Andover, new systems and protocol revisions have been installed to help prevent sexual assault on campus as well as provoke more insightful dialogue around this issue.\nJennifer Elliott ’94, Dean of Students, has been working closely with faculty members and doctors at Isham Health Center and Graham House to create systems that encourage victims of sexual assault on campus to feel comfortable and safe when communicating with adults.\nAll of the counselors at Graham House and staff at Isham Health Center will have completed “First Responders: Responding to Sexual Assault Disclosures,” an online course offered by the Boston Rape Crisis Center, within the coming weeks.\n“Victims explain that those [first] conversations are so essential in their ability to process and in their ability to move forward. We feel particularly adamant that those conversations are safe for our kids. That’s really important,” said Elliott.\nCarol Israel, Director of Graham House, said, “We are always doing professional development. We are always taking classes to keep current. This is something we’ve always done. This year, our first professional development is going to be focused on responding to sexual assault disclosure. It seemed that that was a good topic to put at the top of our list in terms of what we need to focus on.”\nElliott and her team have also created a flow-chart modeling those found on college campuses that will allow students to identify their options when dealing with sexual assault. These flow-charts will be posted in locations accessible to both students and faculty.\n“We’re working from this [flow-chart] angle in terms of how to support our victims, but we’re also doing a lot of work in terms of trying to promote conversation, trying to strategize for means of prevention and trying to work with our kids so that the feel they have the resources before assault or any sort of violence happens,” said Elliott.\nDr. Amy Patel, Medical Director at Isham Health Center, said, “The biggest thing that has changed is that we need to make sure that all students can speak to our sexual assault policies and procedures. Everyone needs to have ready access to these procedures.”\nIn addition to the sexual assault flow-chart, the new CrisisManager app features an option for students to report a case of sexual assault. As identified in the protocols on the app, if and when a student reports a case of sexual assault, that student will be admitted to Isham as quickly as possible so that staff members can provide private and safe support.\n“From my perspective, when we collect data, whether it’s through The Phillipian or the student health survey, we’re never going to be satisfied with a number greater than zero of students who have been the victim of sexual assault on campus. That is not acceptable,” said Elliott.\nFollowing the Strategic Plan of 2014-2015, the school will continue to develop the four-year Empathy and Balance curriculum that focuses on health, wellness and community well-being to encompass more education about sexual assault. This summer was spent developing new courses for the curriculum, such as a ninth grade course in the style of Personal and Community Education (PACE) classes pertaining to sexual assault education, and revising what current courses are offered to align more concretely with these new goals. The Physical Education department has also offered more time for the staff at Isham to expand the sexual education course given when students take its classes.\nPatel said, “We’ve opened the door for anyone to have conversations with us if anything is happening. Actually, as adults, we have a lot that we want to educate and offer. More and more, we’re developing programs that include students as active bystanders. Students play a pivotal role [in] ensuring that the culture changes.”\n“We want to not only be supportive of them but also to create a culture on this campus that is actively against a rape culture,” she continued.\nThe recent St. Paul’s School sexual assault case has ignited conversations around sexual assault on campus.  Two All-School Meetings centering around this topics will be held in the next few weeks in order to address these conversation. One will be led by Head of School John Palfrey to outline the school’s sexual assault policies. The other will involve an activity where students divide into groups and engage in faculty-led conversations about healthy relationships.\n“The broad term we’re using for these programs is ‘Healthy Relationships and Safe Choices.’ We feel as if having these additional programs where we will hold small group discussions will bring everybody up to speed and help everyone feel more comfortable not just talking about issues, but also changing some behaviors on campus,” said Rajesh Mundra, Assistant Dean of Students.\nExpected to be at the forefront of the creation of this conversations are Prefects and Proctors. This year’s Prefect and Proctor training programs have placed a heavy emphasis on initiating discussions about healthy romantic and sexual relationships.\n“It is important for Proctors and Prefects to be able to facilitate discussions with both the House Counselors [and] fellow students. In the training program, we talked about ways in which they can facilitate that type of conversation,” Mundra said, “ The Proctors and Prefects themselves have had conversations with each other, not just about the nature of sexual assault but about school codes and traditions, about keeping silence [and] the bystander behavior at this school.”\nElliott said, “These conversations have been going on for years, and I think the [recent] St. Paul’s case no doubt felt like it electrified conversations in all of our boarding schools in thinking about our unique challenges that we face as a residential school. Every time there’s a massive case… I think educators feel a heightened sense of responsibility to our kids.”\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2015'), ('\nBoston’s Mayor, Martin J. Walsh, appointed Head of School John Palfrey as the head of the Boston Public Library’s presidential search committee last Wednesday. “It’s a huge honor, and it’s one of the most important cultural institutions in the country. I feel like this is a way I could do ‘Non Sibi’ service while doing good at my day job. It’s time-limited, and I am not signing up for a new job; I am just helping to run the process,” said Palfrey in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAs the chair of the search committee, Palfrey will be leading his team to narrow down the possible candidates, before presenting the finalists to the mayor. The committee will be looking for a replacement for the previous president, Amy E. Ryan, who, according to the “Boston Globe,” resigned in July following controversy surrounding the disappearance of two expensive pieces of art.\nAccording to Palfrey, the committee is looking for a president who will be a good manager and keeper of the library’s special collections, take advantage of the digital transformation and recognize the library’s broad spectrum of needs.\n“One of the challenges of running a big institution clearly at this time when the technology and other factors are changing so quickly is to find somebody who has a broad range of skills. But fundamentally, we need somebody who is a very good manager. We need somebody who is able to build and nurture a team of people who will carry out that work day to day effectively. So that’s actually a big part of it, to say, ‘Do you have the skills to manage a diverse set of activities?’” said Palfrey.\nIn addition, Palfrey, having lived around Boston for most of his life, accounts spending a lot of time in the Boston Public Library during his childhood. Although Palfrey does not have any official experience working in the Boston Public Library, he previously served as the director of the Widener Library at Harvard University and was a member of the library board, supervising the 73 libraries at the University.\nAdditionally, Palfrey is the founding member of the Digital Public Library, a project looking to create an extensive, public digital library. He also wrote BiblioTech: Why Libraries Matter More Than Ever in the Age of Google, which he wrote while serving on the board of Harvard’s library.\n\n featured \n\n', 'Sep 18, 2015'), ('\nLined with glass windows and floored with fresh wooden panels, the new Makerspace, located in the basement of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), offers an innovative take on the student learning experience.\nBuilt over the summer by members of the Office of the Physical Plant (OPP), the Makerspace is open to the entire Andover community and features a 3-D printer, a sewing machine, a laser cutter and a vinyl cutter.\n“[The Makerspace is a] lean, flexible and informal space, bringing together different people of different backgrounds and skill sets to solve problems, discuss ideas and develop skills,” said Michael Barker, Director of OWHL, in a Tang Institute presentation on Tuesday.\nBarker said that the goal is for students to pioneer the use of the Makerspace on their own. To achieve this, Barker is working with several students to promote the use of the Makerspace.\n“Success for me would be this: a kid has an idea, they go to the space and with the tools they need, they figure out [a solution] which could help them grow and cultivate that idea… Then they would share it with the world,” said Barker.\nDarius Lam ’17, John Koobatian ’17 and Alex Davenport ’17 have been helping to publicize the space and sharing their input on the process.\n“I am in charge of getting people to come to the Makerspace, getting people to use the tools that are available in the Makerspace, [teaching students] how to use [the tools] and just facilitating the activities that go on there,” said Lam.\n“From my perspective, the mission of the Makerspace is to serve as a way for students to come up with new ideas and as a way for students to complete those ideas,” continued Lam.\nThe Techmasters, a club on campus, has offered to help students who are interested in utilizing the Makerspace. Techmasters have also created an app that will allow students using the space to ask for help using the Makerspace equipment.\nThe planning of the space started in April, after Barker and select students interested in the project did some research. Barker discussed the idea of the Makerspace with the Big Ideas club, the Robotics club and the Makers club, among others.\n“We asked a ton of questions about how these spaces worked, how kids particularly use them and learn from them and most importantly, how do you grow this space? What’s really interesting about it?” said Barker during the Tang Institute presentation.\nWhen constructing the space, Barker focused on preserving simplicity.\n“[We installed] simple equipment to get started for now, but I hope that the kids will tell me what they want to build and I will use some of the fund given to start that project,” said Barker.\nBarker also said that he hopes the space will prove to be essential when teaching students about design-thinking.\n“Design-thinking, in a nutshell, is a highly empathetic process to innovate. It’s built off the idea that ‘I can’t build a product that you like unless I really know who you are, and I really know how you think and operate,’” said Barker.\nThe Makerspace can be used for a range of purposes. Barker has planned for the space to be involved in faculty classes, clubs, student independent projects, clubs, organizations, weekend workshops and other outreach events.\n“[Some people] don’t think they can be creative with technology because they don’t have the experience. The Makerspace is supposed to show them that you can be creative; you can do these projects without any past experience,” said Lam.\nThe Makerspace was funded by the Alexander family, who approached Barker with a fund to go toward any space inside the OWHL.\nThough the Makerspace is a recent addition to the Andover campus, there have previously been places on campus designed for use by the entire Andover community and similarly dedicated to design and innovation. Barker said that there is currently a Makerspace in Tang Theatre that is used for school productions.\n“I think [the Makerspace] is a great way for kids to learn. I think it’s a great tool faculty can use to pair what they use…in the classroom. It’s at their disposal, so I think it’s got a lot of benefits [for] teaching and learning,” said Barker.\nBarker plans on celebrating the launch of the Makerspace with a party available to the community and led by student-run clubs.\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2015'), ('\nSitting on the edge of their seats, the members of WoCo & Co. nervously waited, hoping their team name would be announced in front of the hundreds of spectators and reporters gathered at the Yelp headquarters for the Technovation World Pitch. In addition to coming in second place globally and first place in the United States for their positivity-promoting app, PraisePop, WoCo received the inaugural UN Women Prize for the Top National Team in the 2015 Technovation Challenge.\nIn June, the team, consisting of Qiqi Ren ’15, Sloane Sambuco ’16, Jenny Huang ’16 and Moe Sunami ’17, ventured to San Francisco for five days to compete at the 2015 Technovation World Pitch. WoCo earned the chance to present their app to several hundred spectators, including representatives from leading tech companies and reporters from the “Wall Street Journal” and CNET, as well as to tour the offices of major companies such as Twitter and Amazon.\n“My highlight of the event was before our pitch when we had to do some kind of expo, a poster session of our app. Someone at Apple, Inc. offered to contact us so that we [could] work with them and they [could] help us make and develop the app. That was cool, just to get some one-on-one feedback on the app and be treated as professionals,” said Sunami.\nHuang said, “Personally, when we started the competition it was just for fun and just to see what we could do. To get to the top six though and be named number one in the U.S. and number two in the world was insane.”\nSambuco said, “We got third place at regionals so we thought the entire competition was over. [We thought] we wouldn’t get to go to San Francisco and do the World Pitch, but then we saw that we made it to semifinals which was crazy, and then we got placed among the top six, which was even more so.”\nPraisePop aims to spread happiness, an issue that WoCo believes Andover struggles with. They cite their firsthand experience with the problem as one of the team’s greatest strengths.\nHuang said, “We’ve experienced the problem ourselves which really helped when developing the app because we could cater the app to all the users… we are the users.”\nSambuco said, “We also bounce our ideas off each other… we’re not all coming from the same place, so we carry a lot of different opinions which translates to what the user will experience with the app. We’re diverse.”\nWoCo acknowledges that part of their success comes from genuine dedication to their product, despite the fact that they had a late start to the competition.\nSunami said, “By Spring Break we had just decided on our app. We were working on it in April which was really late compared to everyone else, but once we got into it, it blew up and we kept working. Our goal was to get to San Francisco.”\nAs of right now, the team is diverting their attention to the release of PraisePop on the iTunes App Store and the start of the promotion for the app here at Andover. A launch party will take place this Fall Term on campus.\n“We’re starting to promote it here because even though the app is going to be out on the App Store, it’s just going to sit there if we don’t do anything about it. We’re trying to foster a community of PraisePop users, first at Andover, then other schools. We’re going to have campus reps at other schools around Andover and schools in different places in the US. A lot of people thought this was a good idea and wanted to support it,” said Sunami.\nHuang said, “What we’re really aiming for comes after the competition.

We wanted to really educate [students] about micronutrients, power-foods and why they are so important,” said Kip.\nOver the summer, David Rossetto, Executive Chef, attended a conference in New York called Menus of Change, a collaboration between the Harvard School of Public Health and the Culinary Institute of America (CIA). At Menus of Change, Rossetto learned about culinary techniques and tips, as well as new menu guidelines.\n“We really felt that those guidelines fit right in with what we wanted to do: reduce sugar, processed food, sugary beverages and fatty foods… That’s what we used as our guiding principles,” said Robarge.\nRobarge said that one of the main goals of the new menu is to promote healthy eating habits for students.\n“[Students] are at [Andover] for four years. That’s a long time. If we can help develop better eating habits, then I think we’ve done what we’re supposed to be doing here,” said Robarge.\nThe new menu also offers more items made from scratch, such as pizza dough made from sweet potato and whole-wheat flour, a feature that allows the dining menu to be more cost-effective.\n“With the increase in food-cost every year, which has been astronomical, scratch [cooking] offsets that cost. We’re staying right in line with where we’re supposed to be for food source budgets,” said Robarge.\n“We’re trying to reduce the amount of processed food as much as possible,” continued Rossetto.\nWith the goals of sustainability, wellness and health in mind, Kip and the Paresky Culinary team wanted to focus on student and faculty performance as well.\n“Performance is not just academic performance, it is performance in everything you do–academic, athletic, having fun, being your best and resting well when you rest.

Over the summer, the structural component of the building was completed and several enhancements were added to the existing blueprint, including changes in the usage of space within the building and the additional construction of a garden.\n“A main advantage is the new building’s proximity to core campus and student travel paths. The new Sykes Center is the same size as the old Isham Health Center, but due to an efficient design, will comfortably fit both the Isham team and the Graham House team,” said Larry Muench, Director of Facilities.\nIn addition, new titles and offices have been designated within the Isham and Graham staff, following the development of concrete plans for space use. Amy Patel, Medical Director, said that the staff is currently working to minimize wait time and expedite access to the right medical provider for students.\nPatel added that a previously set room for storage will now be used as a space for student clubs to meet and conduct health-related discussions, including Dear Sam, Andover Global Health Initiative, Students in Medicine, and Meditation Club.\n“We recognized that we wanted more space for students to utilize the Sykes Wellness Center in ways beyond just care, so we took a room and made it a collaborative office space,” she said.\nThe East Garden, modelled after a “zen” or “healing” garden, will face Benner House and feature an area for relaxation as well as space for classes and clubs to convene.\n“It will be a relaxing place to reflect, study, learn in an outdoor classroom format, and a beautiful backdrop through the windows on that side of the building,” said Patel.\nOnce Isham Health Center moves to the new building over Thanksgiving Break, the current location will close for renovation in February 2016 to become a new dorm for fall term, separated from the existing Isham dormitory.\n“The construction will consist of a complete interior renovation of all three floors to transform the infirmary into a modern dormitory,” said Muench.\nThe use of Graham House is to be further determined in the future, according to Patel.\n“I think [this transition] is going to be an absolutely incredible opportunity for our students to think about their health and wellness and [for the Wellness Center] to be much more accessible on a regular basis.

The renovation also included new flooring.\n“The fitness center had been scheduled for new flooring and paint over the summer.

Last year’s Blue Book did not stipulate rules regarding conditions of consent.\n“We have added language around healthy relationships and consent that all students should read, think through and ask questions about if they do not understand,” said Jennifer Elliott, Dean of Students.\nFurthermore, the revised Blue Book removed language that explicitly discourages sexual activity, although it does maintain, as it did last year, that there are circumstances in sexual relationships on boarding school campuses that are particularly challenging.\nThe revised Blue Book also includes new regulations regarding the possession of e-cigarettes by students on school. This year’s Blue Book bans the possession of e-cigarettes, while last year’s Blue Book contained language that only banned the “repeated use of… e-cigarettes.”\n“In terms of the e-cigarettes, I think we are aware of and know that they are devices that can be used to facilitate not only tobacco use but also marijuana use and other drugs. It is hard to decipher between those drugs, and we want to give kids every reason possible to make good choices and take care of themselves,” said Elliott.\nElliott said that of all the revisions to the Blue Book, she believes the change in stance on consent  is the most important.\n“It is important for students to know how strongly we feel about affirmative consent, that the absence of consent does not qualify as consent,” said Elliott.\nRoom-visiting policies and practices were designed to set boundaries for safe and healthy relationships amongst students and to help establish respect for students of all genders, Elliott said.\n“What I think we are working hard on and thinking a lot about is that we have room-visiting practices of binary perspective and gender, given that we have boy and girl dorms. Our [revised] room-visiting procedures are designed to honor that we have students on this campus who do not define themselves on that binary and are rather along the spectrum,” said Elliott.\nAdditionally, the Blue Book now requires all students riding taxis to inform and notify their House Counselors in advance. Last year’s Blue Book contained no such language.\n“[Getting permission to ride a taxi] is not the same procedure as getting a car permission, but we want to know for student safety where our kids are,” said Elliott.\nAlthough the changes made in the Blue Book were mentioned by Cluster Deans to students at the start-of-school cluster meetings, the school administration asks that all students read over the Blue Book every year and ask further questions when necessary.\n“I hope that [the changes in the Blue Book] will ignite further conversation around open communication, healthy relationships, decision making and communication that kids really need to be having with each other and with adult members on campus,” said Elliott.\n\n', 'Sep 11, 2015'), ('\n74 graduates from Andover’s Class of 2015 were taken into protective custody during a party in Sunapee, New Hampshire early on Monday morning, according to the “Eagle Tribune.” The party was held less than 12 hours after the graduates participated in the 2015 Commencement ceremonies on campus.\nThe graduate who rented the house in which the party took place was released on $2,500 personal recognizance, but may face up to a year in prison for facilitating an underage house party that involved alcohol, according to the “Tribune.”\n“I am glad to know that no one was hurt and that all our graduates are safe and sound.

She gathered the group by emailing a broad network of students whom she felt would represent a diverse group of menstruating students who show similar passion in the subject areas of her project.\n“Understanding menstruation not in terms of women, but in terms of anybody who menstruates, regardless of gender identity, was necessary for the piece to be representative of Third Wave menstrual activism,” said Singer.\nSinger said that she received some backlash from students who believed that her installation existed solely within the context of Andover and not in a global context.\n“People don’t necessarily see me as an artist. They see me more as a student who is doing ‘reckless things’ – a rebel without a cause. As such, it’s been really challenging to have conversations with people because they think that my work is about Andover. While I target oppressive systems that operate at Andover, those same systems operate on a global scale. Hence, my art could exist in any other place,” said Singer.\nSinger also said that she received criticism for her work due to the unintentional timing of installing her final work on Memorial Day. She initially chose the day considering weather patterns and other related logistics but came across a connection between her work and the holiday later on.\n“Many of the lives lost in warfare are those of people who menstruate, an act that is often shamed and policed in the patriarchal military-industrial complex,” wrote Singer in an email to The Phillipian.\nAlthough Singer is glad to see conversations regarding her work arise in the Andover community, she views this phenomenon more as a product of her work and less of an attempted goal in her project.\n“I intentionally designed the tampon’s structure to be fluid and unstable. I wanted the wind to cause the tampon to naturally fall away to reveal the patriarchal forces, represented by the phallic statue, at the very core of the menstrual ‘care’ industry. This industry… is responsible for the disturbing use of menstruators’ bodies to create profit, the [toxic shock syndrome] outbreak of the 80s and the policing of menstruators’ bodies to keep their menstrual blood private and contained,” said Singer.\nEditor’s note: The term “herstory,” as used by Singer, connotes “A reclamation of female narratives that have been erased or ignored in larger historical contexts.”\n\n', 'May 29, 2015'), ('\nNina Scott, Instructor in English, completed her tenure as the advisor to The Phillipian today after serving in the position for 12 years.

Fan will serve as an Advisor to The Phillipian and an Instructor in English.\n“Nina was our mother down there in the newsroom — in the constant craziness of schoolwork, sports, friend drama and trying to publish a quality newspaper, she listened to us, gave us advice and supported us unquestioningly and unconditionally. She was always forgiving, calm and knew just what to say when I called her in tears at one in the morning. Her enthusiasm and belief in us always pushed us to do our best. She taught us how to make journalistic decisions and also how to be responsible people,” said Jamie Chen ’15, Editor in Chief of The Phillipian, vol. CXXXVII.\nFormer board members of The Phillipian recognize, in particular, Scott’s inspirational mentorship.\n\n“I’m so lucky to have had Nina as one of my biggest mentors at Andover. She’s inspired me to do my best inside and outside the newsroom, pushed me to innovate the Sports Section when I thought we couldn’t do more and just taught me to smile and enjoy the little things about life. Nina made me the journalist I am, but in the process, she shaped the person I am today. Although Nina will leave The Phillipian this year, The Phillipian will always be a part of Nina—just like Nina will always be a part of The Phillipian,” wrote Kailash Sundaram ’15, Sports Editor for The Phillipian, vol. CXXXVII, in an email to The Phillipian.\n“Nina… is a mentor in every sense of the word. She’s caring and compassionate, but she was firm and brutally honest when necessary.

She also has an uncanny ability to make an entire room of worn-out and exhausted students smile when she walks in, which is pretty amazing,” wrote Alex Jiang ’15, Online Editor for The Phillipian, vol. CXXXVII, in an email to The Phillipian.\nStudents have cited Scott’s love for and support of the newspaper as standout attribute that made her a strong advisor. Despite the large size of The Phillipian’s boards, Scott has had a poignant, personal impact on many Editors.\n]1 (L.Luo/The Phillipian)\n“At The Phillipian turnover banquet, I made the mistake of not wearing leggings or tights, despite the freezing weather. Nina insisted on driving me back to my dorm after the banquet so I wouldn’t have to walk back in the cold. Moments like that exemplify Nina’s kindness and genuine care for every member of The Phillipian board.

She’s advanced a great 137-year tradition of a free and uncensored student press on campus, while providing students with incredible connections to real-world journalists.

Golkari initially came up with this promposal idea. He and Casagrande searched for a creative, big, yet affordable way to ask their dates and found out that splitting the cost to rent a U-Haul truck would be a good option.\n“I think we maximized extravagance with low cost… I don’t think it really offended anyone necessarily. Most of the students that I have talked to thought it was cool and a well thought-out plan,” said Casagrande.\nAlex Li ’15 and Sofia Valenzuela ’15:\nWith lit candles spelling out “Prom?,” Alex Li ‘15 asked Sofia Valenzuela ‘15 out to prom outside her dorm, Alumni House.\n“I actually got the idea when I was watching ‘Tangled’ with my little sister. It was when Flynn and Rapunzel released the lanterns into the sky, and I thought to myself, ‘Wouldn’t something like that be cool for a promposal?’ so I went from there and developed the idea,” wrote Li in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe preparation of the promposal presented itself as a challenge for Li. Because it would be outdoors, Li had to get his idea approved by Phillips Academy Public Safety. He also had trouble keeping the candles lit due to the blowing wind.\n“I was actually quite frantic because the candles kept on being blown out by the wind. It took me three tries to finally get to a point where they were all lit. I was so nervous during the promposal because some small gusts of wind kept on coming… I was so relieved and happy afterwards though, knowing that it all went perfectly,” said Li.\nAs Valenzuela’s dorm mates peered outside the windows above her dorm, Valenzuela came down screaming ‘Yes!’.\nMarina Folz ’15 & Gabe Blanchard ’16:\nMarina Folz ‘15 decided to stage a scavenger hunt to ask Gabe Blanchard ‘16 to Prom. During their crew practice, Folz asked one of her friends to hand Blanchard the first clue to the hunt before their practice last Wednesday.\n“[The clue] led him to four different buildings that spelled out ‘PROM’ in the end, and the last clue led him back behind to where the buses leave for crew,” said Folz.\n“The clue that [Blanchard] got at Pearson Hall said, ‘The red boats are coming, the red boats are coming!’ kind of like, ‘The redcoats are coming,” [for] Paul Revere Dorm,” said Folz.\nBlanchard had not expected the promposal, and he attempted to find out the identity of the person launching the event as his friends were following him along the hunt.\n“I was pretty confused at first. It was a pretty long scavenger hunt and we ended up in the same place as we started which only confused me more. But I also was surprised. I kind of knew that someone was going to ask me, but it was still definitely a surprise,” said Blanchard.\nJacob Kozol ’15 & Paulina Munn ’15\nJacob Kozol ‘15 enlisted the help of the Andover Varsity Crew team to ask Paulina Munn ‘15 to Prom. Before practice, he painted the letters P, R, O and M on the backs of the bow four rowers on his boat, with a question mark written on his stomach.\n“She was on the launch that day so I got the coach to drive out in front of my boat and then I gave a very indiscrete signal. They all took their shirts off and I did also.. then, one at a time, they laid down, spelling out ‘PROM’ and then I just stood up,” said Kozol.\nHe was inspired by “ghostboating,” a fun act rowers in novice boats do by lying down flat in the boat, making it seem like the boat is empty. Once he settled on the idea, Kozol said it was only a matter of buying blue paint and convincing the rowers on his boat to participate.\n“She was pretty surprised, of course said ‘yes’ and then gave me an air hug because I was on the boat! She knew I was going to ask her, she just didn’t know how,” Kozol said.\n\n', 'May 29, 2015'), ('\nThe Memorial Day protest staged on Monday elicited mixed responses, in part because of the actions of some of the protesters, which included blasting music, setting up lawn chairs and finishing homework assignments.\n“I felt that the nature of the protest wasn’t constructive. People were out there sitting with their phones… There were lawn chairs…people were wearing the flag and blasting music, and it was just giving them a bad image,” said Adrienne Allen ’16.\nIn this week’s Letter to the Editor, the protest organizers admitted that the protest was “disorganized.” They also acknowledged that some protesters had only shown up to skip classes.\nAndrew Reavis ’17, a protest leader, said that there was a mixed response from the students, faculty and the administration.\n“Some of my teachers were really pleased that we were doing it and were happy. Others were hesitant to answer for or against, and they were more inquisitive about it, and that was okay. I can understand why they might have questions about it,” said Reavis.\nReverend Anne Gardner, Director of Spiritual and Religious Life, said that during her time at Andover, Memorial Day has been observed in a number of ways, including lowering flags to half-mast and working in conjunction with staff at Paresky Commons to make red, white and blue cupcakes while passing out nametags of Andover alumni who have died in combat.\nIn years past, Gardner utilized a collection of flags to visually mark the 244 deceased Andover alumni. This year, she additionally chose to erect images of combat boots near the memorial to make the human quality of the losses more tangible.\n“I think it is important to note that all of the efforts are meant to impart a sense of gratitude and an opportunity for reflection for the entire Andover community… In addition, while Memorial Day is an American holiday, the theme is not exclusively so. Many other countries have this same sort of observance. Service, and specifically the sacrifice of one’s life in the service of one’s country, is a human endeavor,” wrote Gardner in an email to The Phillipian. Dale Hurley, Instructor in Mathematics and former Navy serviceman, said in an email to The Phillipian that he was impressed by the students who wanted to pay more respect on Memorial Day.\nAuguste White ’17 said, “I think that we underestimate the amount of students who have been touched by deaths and service… Andover is always at its best when it is representing every single voice.”\nKieto Mahaniah ’16, who partook in the sit-in, said that he was glad different parts of the community let their voices be heard on the topic.\n“There were people that didn’t take part but agreed with them and supported them, there were people that didn’t take part and criticized them, and there were teachers who brought food or excused them [students] classes, but there are also teachers who gave cuts and didn’t like it,” he said.\n“Some people didn’t go about the protest in the most respectful way and gave it a little bit of a bad [reputation], but overall, it’s a very good cause,” said Megan Gatton ’17.\nAkhil Rajan ’17 said that he believes the protest was used by students as a means to cut class, rather than a meaningful demonstration.\n“I don’t think an establishment should be in charge of how you pay your respects,” said Jim Soraghan, night custodian, “It’s up to the individual.”\nHilary Gillis ’15 feels that the protests could have been more well organized, and that because of this, the protest was not as meaningful as it could have been.\n“I feel like it’s important that students stand up for what they believe in, but I also think a lot of kids there just didn’t really want to go to class, which isn’t fair to people who actually care about it,” said Gillis\nCandy Chan, Annie Dawon Lee, and Alice Ballard-Rossiter contributed reporting.\n\n', 'May 29, 2015'), ('\nLooking outside the classroom window at Bellesini Academy, Paul Tortorella, Instructor in English, watched his students play on the asphalt parking lot. Tortorella wrote a poem inspired by the children’s creativity and innocence.\nThe poem reads, “Last night I dreamed a bizarre dream / I was playing kickball in the starry, dynamic night sky / The ball was the moon… Is it not viable that in my dream I was simply a star / Not vapid, but filled with night energy.”\nTortorella took a sabbatical this past year to pursue teaching at Bellesini Academy, an all-boys school in Lawrence, Mass., and the Worcester Secure Treatment Facility treatment center in Marlboro, Mass., in the hope of expanding his teaching experience.\n“I applied for a sabbatical because I wanted to teach outside campus walls, expand my field of operations and… help show people some of the things our school cares about. You can call it ‘Non Sibi,’ outreach, collaboration or even education, but what it really is [is] an interest in humanity,” wrote Tortorella in an email to The Phillipian.\nTortorella spent the fall working with Amy Conklin at Bellesini Academy, a teacher there, and her seventh and eighth grade students.\nConklin said that the students at Bellesini absorbed Tortorella’s teaching right away, latching onto his humor and his enthusiasm for literature.\nConklin wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “The students looked forward to the days [Tortorella] came in to teach. He held extremely high expectations for their learning and encouraged all students to become active participants in the classroom. The more [often] he came, the more the students were encouraged to be active readers as well as strong listeners.”\nIn addition to impacting students at Bellesini, Tortorella also connected with teachers.\n“As a teacher, [Tortorella] has reminded me the importance of voice. At times, I find myself always planning lessons that integrate some type of technology or hands-on activity to keep the students interested and engaged, but very simply, [Tortorella] reminded me when you know and love your craft, that sometimes no gimmicks are necessary. Just a teacher and… [a] book holds a lot of power,” said Conklin.\nTortorella also spearheaded a pilot program in collaboration with Andover’s existing Writing Center, bringing Andover students to Bellesini to help the boys craft and edit their descriptive writing assignments, which included everything from writing about courage to writing a paragraph describing a famous photo or painting.\nAlex Humphreys ’15, who participated in the Writing Center at Bellesini, said, “The first time I went, I worked with two sixth graders on an assignment about their courageous moment. The first kid wrote about how he had to comfort and support his family, including his mother, after his father left them, and the second kid wrote about how he had to leave his family and friends in Peru at age six so he could come to America with his dad.”\nHe continued, “It was hard for them to relive those events, and it was especially hard to tell someone they had never met before such personal details about their life. Gaining their trust and seeing that transition from discomfort to pride was one of the more rewarding experiences of my life.”\nBy the time Tortorella left Bellesini, Conklin remarked that his students had grown to be more confident writers, employing sophisticated vocabulary and developing more thoughtful ideas.\n“[Tortorella’s] love of literature transcends to all students. He has left a permanent mark on them. We also have more rich literature discussions as a result of his visits,” said Conklin.\nTortorella undertook a massive change in scenery in the winter, teaching at the Worcester Secure Treatment Facility. With classes scaled down from Bellesini’s 20 to a mere six students, Tortorella learned to adapt to the high security and restrictions inside and outside of the classroom.\nTortorella said, “I was confined to the classroom, and I walked down a hall between the guards. You couldn’t talk to the kids outside the class. [You could] maybe nod to them if you saw them lined up to go into another class or if they were in the conference room talking to a guard or counselor.”\nTortorella said that evolving to this environment was integral to his experience and success as a teacher.\n“Adjust or you don’t survive. It comes with experience. I was surprised a lot by all of the boys [and] how much they appreciated the attention they received. I teach because that is what I am – a teacher. I don’t think about or care about rewards. But when the kids look at you, and you know you have connected on a deep human level, that reward I’ll take,” said Tortorella.\nTortorella experienced the most freedom in the detention facility as he devised his own six-week-long curriculum after observing classes for a couple of weeks. He ultimately decided to teach Romantic Poetry.\n“They loved [the subject]. They loved imagining being out of doors, in nature, and of course, there [are] many romantic poems about love and relationships. It was very moving, sad perhaps, but I could also see their spirits soar. I am getting emotional right now remembering my students there,” said Tortorella. Tortorella’s poetry program required the students to read, listen to, write and analyze a variety of different styles of poems in his signature engaging manner, incorporating technology, rap music and slam poetry to make his assignments more relatable to the students.\nEnglish Language Arts teacher Tony Nuzzetti, who spent four days per week with Tortorella in the classroom, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “As a teacher in this facility for over 40 years, I had a personal bias that poetry and juvenile delinquents really don’t mix well… [Tortorella’s] innovative and creative techniques of infusing poetry with music, rap, slam poetry, videos and images made it all so appetizing to the students and left them hungry for more.” “He was non-threatening, flexible, open-minded, caring and truly enjoyed teaching about poetry. He never forced anything on these students and always made them feel that their contributions, however minimal, were important and worth noting,” continued Nuzzetti.\nThe highlight of Tortorella’s work with the Treatment Facility was the Renga, an ancient Japanese poetic form from which the haiku is derived. A collaborative poem, Tortorella’s students and the students in the English elective called “Lockdown,” taught by Thomas Kane, Instructor in English, each contributed a stanza. Students from both groups built on each other’s work, writing about themes including nature, the seasons and love.\nKane said, “They got the incarcerated students’ minds to travel outside of the facility, as they were able to produce something with their imaginations that transcended the walls. It connected them with other people they otherwise wouldn’t have connected to.”\nDavid Gutierrez ’15, one of Kane’s students, said that the collaborative project broadened his perspective of and appreciation for the Andover community. Gutierrez said, “The most rewarding aspect of writing the poem was the ability to connect with people outside of the Andover bubble. [Tortorella’s] work is so important… Reading the poems made me realize that many of these kids had already given up on being educated. They talked about [questions like] ‘Why am I here?’ And [this] shows that there are issues within… public education and [other] communities that must be fixed.”\nTortorella’s yearlong sabbatical impacted a wide range of students, teachers and educational programs. He leaves behind a legacy of dedication and innovation in the classrooms that he visited.\nTortorella will continue his collaboration with Bellesini by expanding the Mobile Writing Center and with the Treatment Facility by establishing a more permanent pen pal program with Kane’s class.\n\n', 'May 29, 2015'), ('\n“Not So Prepped: Education Gaps in the U.S.,” “Public School: As Told in Four Parts,” “Last Hired, First Fired” and “Immigration” are a few of the articles displayed on the homepage of “The System,” a student-run website dedicated to educating the Andover community about systemic oppression.\nThe mission statement of “The System” says, “Our blog posts are intended to explain what systemic oppression is, describe the many forms it takes and demonstrate how it ultimately harms all of us.”\n“The System” accepts student article submissions on topics relating to systemic oppression in the United States.

So they’re all about power and who’s in power and how they keep power,” said Ashley Scott ’16, a member of “The System.”\nThe idea began to develop when students stayed behind after an Afro-Latino-American Society to discuss the need for a space to educate members of the Andover community about systemic oppression.\n“I think our main goal is to make people of color and [other] oppressed people really feel like this is a space where they are understood and where they can go and voice their problems, their own personal truths, and we don’t want people jeopardizing that,” said Scott.\nIn addition to educating the public and creating a forum for discussion, members of “The System” also hope to inspire students to try and make a change.\nDavid Gutierrez ’15, Student Body Co-President and a member of “The System,” said, “I see [the website] especially playing a role in awareness… I’ve talked to a lot of students… and they feel [helpless]. With this website and this knowledge, you can form groups and try to change… To actually act on something you need to have a foundation of knowledge.”\nWhile in the past there have been events and discussions in response to singular news stories relating to systemic oppression, “The System” aims to create a larger overview that effectively conveys systemic oppression’s broad and pervasive reach.\nJames Taylor ’16, a member of “The System,” said, “Without that proper context, though you can look at a specific event, it makes it harder to comprehend it and understand why people react the way they do to these things happening. And I think it’s in the best interest of everyone here to have as much context and as much understanding as possible in these sorts of scenarios and issues.”\nLooking toward the future, “The System” hopes to grow to address all forms of systemic oppression, including sexism, classism, ableism, and a host of others.\nScott said, “We want people to understand that it’s not just about racism. It’s about all systemic oppression… we also want to encourage people to send in things. We want this to be a community endeavor, we want all the people to participate and write about something that they either find interesting factually or a personal story.”\nTaylor added, “We want as many people as possible to engage with us no matter where your comfort level is, even if right now it’s more so just reading the articles and thinking about it, or if you feel emboldened enough to start writing and really actively participate in the website.

I just think that it’s changed over time,” said Palfrey.\nPalfrey hopes readers of “BiblioTech” will recognize the significance of libraries in the digital age as people continue to access more information from their mobile devices.\n“We’re at a next phase in the historical trajectory. It is where the digital era is clearly ascendant and libraries need to figure out their appropriate role in it. I think that if we didn’t have libraries providing public access to information… in academic or public communities, that would be a huge mistake,” said Palfrey.\nPalfrey also hopes that, in reading “BiblioTech,” readers will come to appreciate the importance of libraries, especially the potential these libraries have in the digital era.\nRegarding the future of libraries, Palfrey hopes that future generations will learn to enjoy libraries as much as previous generations have, even if they are not consulting books as frequently.\n“My hopes for libraries are that it becomes possible to pull forward the amazing work of the past, but do it in a highly relevant way for the present and the future… I think that part of it is to decouple the idea of libraries as a place where people come to get books, and to make it about where people experience and create knowledge,” said Palfrey.\nIn writing “BiblioTech,” Palfrey was largely inspired by the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) and its staff.\n“I think we’re incredibly lucky to have [the OWHL]. I cannot imagine another secondary school that has such a library. I think there are really direct benefits for any community that has such a great library,” said Palfrey.\nPalfrey’s inspiration for “BiblioTech” was also sparked by his love for libraries in general.\n“In large measure, this book is a love letter to libraries and people who work in them, because I think that they play such an essential role in any community.

Tomorrow should be a day of reflecting and commemorating the lives of those lost in combat, not solving chemistry problems,” wrote Cummings on the Class of 2017 Facebook page.\nSoon after, Reavis commented on the post, calling for a sit-in on the steps of SamPhil. The post spread all over Facebook, and after receiving more likes and shares, Johnson began to plan the logistics of the demonstration with Cummings, Reavis, Meyerrose and Nuga, who live together in Flagg House. “We thought there was a better way to commemorate our fallen heroes other than going to class, and considering it was a national holiday, we felt like we had to do something about it. We talked to our House Counselor, [William Leahy], and he was on board and told us how to go about it. He told us to email [Head of School] John Palfrey and our teachers,” said Cummings.\nAfter arriving at SamPhil’s steps at 8 in the morning, the protesters walked to the Memorial Bell Tower at 10:45 a.m., to honor all past Andover veterans and their family members. Students were then encouraged to write letters to the family members of these soldiers and to reflect on what Memorial Day meant to them. As students gathered to reflect on the importance of Memorial Day, a petition to have a set program to celebrate the day was passed around and was signed by 270 students.\nAt 8 p.m., 90 students gathered at the Memorial Bell Tower to salute those who have died in combat as part of an annual program organized by Reverend Anne Gardner, Director of Spiritual and Religious Life.\nInspired by the programming held at Andover annually on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (MLK Day), Cummings, Reavis, Meyerrose and Nuga created an outline for potential Memorial Day programming. Their proposed program would include an All-School Meeting with a guest speaker in the morning and afternoon workshops. The latter would include making trips to veteran hospitals, having forums on injuries caused by military service, making care packages to those serving overseas, writing letters to soldiers’ families and making trips to cemeteries.\nPaul Murphy, Dean of Students, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I think this day is a very personal day and one that each of us commemorates in our own ways. Some have lost relatives or friends in conflicts or wars. Others commemorate because the giving of one’s life is the ultimate sacrifice that very few of us opt to risk our lives for. I applaud the students who have taken a few minutes to educate themselves on the real meaning of the day.” Cummings, Johnson, Meyerrose and Reavis met with Murphy and David Guttierez ’15, Student Body Co-President, to discuss the future of Andover’s observance of Memorial Day.\nJohnson said that the possibility of a Memorial Day planning committee was discussed in the meeting.\nThe protest leaders also plan to present a collection of personal reflections written by students to the administration to further demonstrate the need for a greater observance of the holiday.\n\n featured \n\n', 'May 29, 2015'), ('\nAfter a frantic search for books with strong and active female leaders for her two daughters proved to be unsuccessful, Lani Silversides, Instructor in Mathematics, decided to create her own storybooks.

In one such photo, a young girl wearing patterned leggings is seen swinging wildly at a tennis ball, in another, three children are being taught the proper race starting position by Andover Track’s Co-Captain, Camille Little ’16.\n“It feels like there’s a lot of, in terms of gender, boys being active and strong while the girls are playing dress-up or being quiet and coloring. My girls love to do those things as well but I started questioning, is it because it’s being modeled for them in these books. Are they doing this because it’s what they’re seeing?” said Silversides.\nSilversides also created a website, mystrongisbeautiful.com as a supplement to her storybook. Featuring large, black and white photos of young girls exercising and playing sports, the website is targeted at toddlers and pre-school children. The website also hosts a page of activities such as coloring pages and crossword puzzles that surround the topic of girls in sports.\n“My thought is that parents can access the website and they can show their kids and give them this interactive experience. The site is called ‘My Strong is Beautiful,’ but I believe that those adjectives can be interchanged and can be identified by whomever,” said Silversides.\nSilversides hopes that these images of young girls playing and being carefree will help empower girls who feel insecure being athletic.\n“The photos are really geared towards that active component. They show that these girls love to play. I don’t know if there’s a point where they stop being proud of that, but these photos show that they’re smiling and happy,” said Silversides.\nAs a child, Silversides was exposed to an athletic lifestyle through her constantly active brothers.\n“What you can expose these young kids to, they’re such sponges that if there was a bigger exposure of sports and these strong athletic mindset, they’re going to imitate it or see it and know that they can do that or at least try,” said Silversides.\nSilversides is currently searching for people among the Andover community to help her create content for her website.  She also wants parents and girls anywhere to submit their own photos to add to the online gallery.\n“My goal is to inspire young girls to be active. Empowering them to be proud of who they are and if part of who they are is athletic and active then I want them to be proud of that,” said Silversides.\nIn the future, Silversides plans to move beyond girls of the toddler and pre-school age and include middle school girls.\n“I want to open doors for them that they might assume is closed because of the society and culture we live in.

It is always great to have new perspective on teaching and I think the teaching fellows bring great energy to their departments and to the school as a whole,” she added.\nIn her new position, Allen will also help coordinate the New Administrator Workshop and the New Faculty Orientation. She will work closely with Emma Frey, Instructor in History, to organize teaching fellow seminars.\n“As a new department chair this year, the New Administrators’ Workshop was very helpful in developing skills needed to work with students, colleagues and parents in a way I had not done before. Working with people through an administrative lens has been quite fun and challenging in a good way, and I look forward to the opportunity this new role brings, ” said Allen.\nSince arriving at Andover in the fall of 2000, Allen has served as an Instructor in Spanish for 15 years and the Department Chair this past year.

The installation will start the summer of 2016 and is scheduled to be completed during the winter of 2018. The projected is slated to cost 40 million dollars.\nThe 96,000-square-foot field house will replace the functions of the Case Memorial Cage and the Smith Center. It will be equipped with a 4-lane, 200-meter indoor track, 12 new squash courts, additional space to conduct Lifetime, Instructional and Fitness Education sports and three multi-purpose courts and space to provide indoor practice for outdoor sports. The new athletic complex aims to improve both the athletic curriculum at Andover and the experience of the visiting teams.\n“We envision this building to be transformative due to its ability to be utilized by nearly every Andover sporting team in some way. The new, large space will allow for many diverse activities to occur at concurrent times, relieving congestion and scheduling issues in our current facility,” wrote Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe new buildings will be located just north of Phelps Stadium—across from the varsity tennis courts.\nLeon Modeste, Athletic Director, said, “The immediate thing that the field house will do will be to make it so that our teams can eat dinner at a regular hour. Right now with squash, basketball and swimming, kids are eating then going to sports. We want the entire athletic window to go from 3 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. so that kids can eat and be done with sports and go on to the rest of their lives.”\nArchitects from Perkins+Will designed the new plans for the field house and squash center. Fundraising for the project has already started, taking the form of donations from alumni, friends and family. The Andover athletic facilities have not been renovated since 1979, when the Abbot Wing was installed, and the construction of these new athletic facilities is the first phase in a four-phase Athletics Master Plan that will take eight years to complete.\nPhase Two will be the addition of a new swimming pool where the current Case Memorial Cage stands. Phase Three will be the construction of connector between the pool and the rest of the athletic complex, as well as a new performance gym for interscholastic games. Phase Four will be the renovation of the two current gyms and to expand the Rosenau Fitness Center.\nNancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, and Jennifer Smith, Capital Project Manager, were appointed as Co-Coordinators of the Athletic Facilities Master Plan.\n“A big question was posed by the Senior Administrative Council to the Athletic Council six years ago: what is the role of athletics in the Andover experience? How important are athletics? How do we give our kids the best environment for having a great athletic experience here?” said Jeton.\nThe idea for the Athletics Facilities Master Plan was first proposed by Head of School John Palfrey, after his investiture. The plan was then presented to the Board of Trustees during the winter of 2015 and was approved this spring.\n“The end goal is to have a great athletic facility to serve all of our students – those invested in creating life habits and as well as those who aspire to be intercollegiate contestants. [The Athletics Facilities Master Plan] supports the strategic plan, especially the wellness and balance piece. It is one of the institutional imperatives of the strategic plan,” said Jeton.\nAccording to the text of the Master Plan, the vision for the project is to provide “exercise for all students,” have “athletics complete by dinner,” “improve [the] athletic complex,” “enhance [the] history and tradition [of Borden Gym],” maintain “fiscal responsibility” and enable “sustainable planning.”\nAside from Jeton and Smith, those involved in the Athletics Facilities Master Planning Committee are Clyfe Beckwith, Instructor in Physics and Head Coach of Volleyball, Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty and Instructor in Math, Thomas Lockerby, Secretary of the Academy, Erin Strong, Instructor in Theatre and Dance, and Modeste.

The four-person team, consisting of Qiqi Ren ’15, Sloane Sambuco ’16, Jenny Huang ’16 and Moe Sunami ’17, will fly to San Francisco, CA, to participate in the 2015 World Pitch this June.\nDuring their trip, the four will tour the city, attend a number of entrepreneurship workshops and pitch their product before a crowd of hundreds of tech professionals, with a chance to win up to $10,000 in prizes.\nOver the course of three months, WoCo planned, coded and designed PraisePop, a completely anonymous iOS app with the focus of spreading positivity and inclusivity at Andover and communities throughout the world. A female-only challenge, Technovation encourages girls to take on the practice of coding and provides female technology professionals who guide the participants throughout the app-making process.\nThis year’s challenge asked participants to develop an app that addressed a problem currently plaguing their community: for WoCo, it was the lack of positivity at Andover.\nCollecting data from a series of potential-user surveys, the team quickly saw the need for a happier, more inclusive atmosphere at Andover. Seeing the merits of the Facebook page “PA Compliments,” the girls hoped to develop an accountable system that would allow for a harmonious balance between anonymity and positivity.\n“Negativity and exclusivity are prominent in many communities. Too often people feel alone, excluded and unacknowledged. With PraisePop, people can spread positivity and inclusivity in their communities by anonymously sharing uplifting posts,” said Sambuco.\nWhen users first open PraisePop, they are prompted to make an account with their institution’s email address. For Andover community members, it would be their andover.edu address. Each email domain connects to its own personalized feed, allowing users to see posts relevant to their communities. Designed around a popcorn theme, the app’s interface then allows users to write anonymous compliments about other community members, compiling the posts into a community-wide feed and allowing viewers to up-vote posts by clicking on a kernel and popping it into popcorn. Each post, although unnamed, is embedded with a “Report” button, which notifies the team of cases of potential negativity. After receiving a report of misconduct, WoCo will investigate the issue and then, if deemed necessary, trace the email account linked to the post back to its owner – a system designed to ensure accountability among the app’s users.\n“Users can direct posts to one person, a group of people, or even create invitations to everyone, for example, to play ultimate or soccer on the lawn,” said Sambuco.\nWoCo won third place after pitching their app to an audience of 300 people at the regional event held in Cambridge, Mass. The team was flattered when, a week later, the judges selected them to advance to the semifinal round, placing them among the top 18 teams in the nation. The semifinals were judged entirely online by a panel of experts who evaluated the work of all teams to then narrow the pool down to six finalists.\n“I thought that was as far as we’d go; I literally wasn’t expecting to move on into Finals at all. But then, during the Dance Open show on Saturday, I remembered that the finalists were announced at 8:00 p.m. so I checked my phone out of curiosity and it turned out that I’d [received] about 20 texts. I took that as a good sign, and then I saw the name ‘WoCo’ in the announcement, and I let out a scream backstage!” said Sunami.\n“I was so surprised, and my heart was pounding so fast. I felt beyond ecstatic, and I couldn’t believe that all of our hard work had finally paid off. I’m so excited to go to San Francisco and share PraisePop with the world. PraisePop will take San Francisco by storm,” said Huang.\nAt the World Pitch competition, WoCo will have the opportunity to take part in numerous workshops designed to continue their growth as technology entrepreneurs. At Yelp’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco, the finalists will pitch their projects on June 24, attempting to win the favor of a distinguished panel of judges. The following night, finalists will attend the Technovation Awards Ceremony, a gala attended by hundreds of technology professionals, where $20,000 worth of prizes will be awarded, including $10,000 to the winning team.\nNext week, a California-based film crew, led by critically acclaimed filmmaker Lesley Chilcott, will be flying out to Andover to feature WoCo in their upcoming documentary: “#GirlsInTech”. Chilcott, who produced former Vice President Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” and the educationally-introspective documentary “Waiting for ‘Superman,” has been following and filming a number of teams from around the globe who are participating in the Technovation Challenge. After WoCo advanced to the semifinal round, the film crew became amazed with the app’s design and asked if they would be interested in taking part in the documentary. “[The film crew] is going to film in the library, in Commons, in the dorm, anywhere that the girls will be working together. It’s exciting and I think [becoming finalists] rightly recognizes [their app] as a big effort and really terrific work––the app itself, the business plan, the pitch video, the demo and even the poster,” said Maria Litvin, Instructor in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, in an interview with The Phillipian.\nWoCo’s application for an Abbot Grant was recently approved by the Abbot Academy Association’s Board of Directors. The team plans to use the funds to purchase a server to process and store data, register a web domain and to expand the app’s operation on other devices, addressing the 12 percent of the student body that doesn’t use iPhones.\n\n featured \n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nJason Young ’15 first understood why feminism is necessary during his Junior year. Andover was a new environment for the Michigan native, who was quick to embrace Andover’s inclusivity.\n“I know that there are things that aren’t perfect about me, and I’ve certainly come a long way,” said Young. “I think as a Junior, I was that kid who did have a couple sexist and homophobic views, but then [was] able to learn from those and grow so that I can understand my role within all of it and go in the opposite direction.”\nJohn Gorton ’15 understood the importance of feminism in his classroom while teaching a Personal and Community Education (PACE) class to a group of Lowers. The class was discussing the gender expectations that society forces upon people, a nuanced topic often paired with an impersonal conversation. But the brutally honest confessions and stories he heard regarding the oppression of females were more than enough to pull at Gorton’s heartstrings.\nCem Vardar ’15 understood when he first stepped onto Andover’s campus as a new Upper. Born and raised halfway across the world in Turkey, his first year at Andover introduced him to the true meaning behind feminism’s goals. Thinking consciously about what the idea of equality for all genders meant, Vardar’s exposure to students’ individual activism—by way of clubs, forums and speakers—helped him to understand the nuances and complexities of the movement, adopting and enacting feminism wholeheartedly.\nTom Burnett ’15 understood all throughout his childhood. Describing himself as not being especially masculine while growing up, Burnett first became cognizant of gender issues and the intricacies of identity at a young age. Entering Andover as a new Lower, Burnett said he was exposed to an unhealthy culture surrounding masculinity that manifested itself in the form of late-night conversations in the dorm, sexist talk in the locker room and slurs on male sports teams. It was then in his Upper year that Burnett saw the breadth of the inclusivity and equity that the feminist movement was fighting for.\nFor these four Seniors and many other male students on Andover’s campus, the role of men within feminism is built upon a sense of duality. Acting as both voices of support and insatiable listeners, men who identify as feminists support the movement by being outspoken activists and also are aware of when to take a step back from encroaching, all four said. After first acknowledging the privilege that comes with being male, men can effectively act as allies to the movement, engaging in the conversation to develop practical solutions aimed at achieving gender equality.\nFeminism, Gorton said, is the movement to deconstruct or eliminate misogyny, patriarchy, sexism and sexist oppression. More commonly, feminism is referred to as the fight for equality for all genders. This notion of total inclusivity raises and debunks its greatest misconception: feminism is limited to women. Rather, the movement welcomes everyone to share their opinions and to engage in the promotion of global gender equality.\n“I would like to think that the best way to be mindful of gender inequality on campus and to be a feminist in social circles here is to bring feminism into the conversation in everyday life and to point out places where misogyny or patriarchy are coming into play,” said Gorton.\nBurnett recounted his own experience with feminism, describing how he felt pressured to conform to what he perceived as a culture of hypermasculinity at Andover.\n“The way I entered the feminist movement as a Lower, I thought, ‘This is something that’s saying only women have problems, but I feel like I have problems, too.’ … But, I didn’t realize that feminism actually serves to solve problems that men have as well as problems that women have,” said Burnett.\nSafe spaces with the intent of instilling comfort within allies failed to effectively exist this past year, they say, as there were no means to monitor them.\nAs knowledge and awareness form the cornerstone of every feminist, having a proper education about gender issues and an acute sense of empathy are fundamental attributes of male allies, they said.\n“[Feminism] is about listening and making sure that you’re always learning. I think, because there’s so much about social activism in general — not just feminist activism — it’s about lived experiences, hearing people’s stories and seeing how they can speak to larger things that are going on in society,” said Kory Stuer ’15, another male feminist.\n“It’s my responsibility to educate myself and become an active listener and discusser with other people. I believe that systems can change; they are human made and therefore can change,” said Vardar.\nBut, in terms of Andover’s gender and feminism education, one of the issues raised by Young, Gorton, Vardar and Burnett was Andover’s failure to provide a properly structured feminist curriculum, confusing students with a mismatch of varying information.\n“Right now, the way people are getting educated about gender, about feminism, about patriarchy, about privilege in lots of different ways is completely disjointed,” said Gorton. “There’s CAMD stuff, which is either clubs or CAMD speakers; there’s occasional [All-School Meetings]; there’s sometimes Proctor/Prefect training; there’s PACE Senior meetings and PACE classes; there’s dorm talks—but none of this stuff is unified in any sort of way.”\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nIt began with a vote. Then, a letter. And then, a “New York Times” article.\nIt was the spring of 2013 and Feminism=Equality (F=E) burgeoned into a flourishing movement, all at the hands of 12 Seniors from the Class of 2013 on an impassioned mission to achieve gender equality. In an interview with The Phillipian, MJ Engel ’13, Maia Hirschler ’13 and Jing Qu ’13, three students who were at the epicenter of Andover’s feminist movement, recounted their time at Andover as part of the charge to advocate for a feminist-based, post-gender community.\n“I define [feminism] in two ways. One is more of the empowerment of women, but I think a more accurate definition for me is that feminism is more of a perspective and mode of thinking—kind of like a lens and also a critical-thinking toolkit in order to understand the world and its structures and its resulting inequalities,” said Engel, who attended Andover for all four years and is currently at Columbia University as a rising junior.\nOn January 19, 2013, Student Council voted 20-3 to change the Council’s structure to a Co-President model replacing the one-president system that had been in place since 1973. In the lead-up to the vote, Student Council held a number of closed door discussions, debating the merits and faults of implementing the proposed system. Engel saw the Co-Presidential model as a pivotal moment in Andover history that addressed the gender inequality that had become structurally propagated through Student Council’s election system.\nEngel, who ran an unsuccessful bid for Student Body President back in 2012, said that she felt victimized during her campaign because of her gender, hearing derisive comments from strangers who implied that she was not qualified for the role of Student Body President. Engel thus became a fierce proponent of the Co-Presidential model, viewing it as a chance to curb females’ inhibitions from stepping into the race.\n As the month dragged on, dissent against the new Co-Presidential model began to envelop campus. Hirschler, a four-year Senior from New York, NY, and is currently a rising junior at Yale University, recalled a conversation in the library between herself and Engel.  Hirschler said that Engel confessed her fear that students weren’t seeing the new model as a way to fight and make right the sexism that had become ingrained in Andover’s culture.\n“That sort of just opened my eyes and shattered the ‘Andover Bubble’ within the ‘Andover Bubble,’ ” said Hirschler.\nOn March 1, 2013, Engel, Hirschler and three others published a Letter to the Editor in The Phillipian, charging students to use the power of their vote to its fullest in the upcoming Co-Presidential election. The letter, which Qu and six others signed, examined the lack of female presidents over the school’s history and cited that absence of female leadership as the source of girls’ doubts to enter the race as candidates. Within a matter of hours, the letter sparked campus-wide debate, causing impassioned conversations in classrooms, in dorms, on paths and even online.\nIn the weeks following the letter’s publication, students filled The Phillipian’s Commentary pages with black ink, penning Letters to to the Editor to raise different perspectives and contrasting arguments. Even with Finals Week and Spring Break looming in the distance, the conversations did not die down; rather, they were ignited by pent-up emotions and the desire to discover truth within the matter. As students departed for vacation, they brought feminism with them to all corners of the world.\nOver break, Engel, Hirschler, Qu and nine others began organizing for the term ahead, officially giving birth to the Feminism=Equality movement. Foremost a group of a friends, the F=E team worked harmoniously with one another to plan out a course of action to help further the campus discussion and implant a system of education within the student body.\n“Our whole grassroots movement wasn’t engineered; everything was super organic,” said Qu, who attended Andover for four years and is also a rising junior at Columbia University.\nOn April 11, 2013, “The New York Times” published an exposé on Andover’s first Co-Presidential election, which ended with a face-off between Junius Williams ’14 and Clark Perkins ’14 and Farris Peale ’14 and Ben Yi ’14. “The Times” highlighted the gender compositions of each pair and focused on the tension that ran through campus regarding the race. Ultimately, Williams and Perkins took the victory.  But, Hirschler said, the article legitimized the feminist cause at Andover and sparked even more dialogue across campus.\nTo foster a safe, organized and fair space to discuss feminism and its various intersections, F=E created “Feminism at Andover,” an active Facebook group that acts as a forum available for anyone affiliated with Andover. Members of the group often share articles, research and thoughts to engage the community.\nAlong with the Facebook group, the team created a website that shared F=E’s central principles, most commonly known for its “Experiences” page, where Andover community members could submit anonymous encounters with gendered microaggressions, establishing a collection of all of the times where sexism has prevailed at Andover despite the common force against it.\n“When it came time to present at faculty meetings, [the Experiences] were unbelievably eye-opening both for us and the students we worked with and more so for the faculty. Like, when a girl walks into Math 600 and you say, ‘Oh good, we have a girl,’ that’s (a) a gendered comment but (b) also making that female student super aware of how she is representative of her gender,” said Engel.\nEngel and Qu’s time at Columbia has inspired them to further their studies and activism at large. Concentrating in women, gender and sexuality studies, Engel has challenged and opened up her mind in many different ways, coming to understand some of the most complex nuances of feminism. On the other end, Qu is a volunteer for the school’s Sexual Violence Response system, providing confidential advocacy to victims of sexual assault, and is also involved in remodeling Columbia’s orientation program for next year.\n“One thing that just makes my day is [that] I still get the notifications for [Feminism at Andover] and still see people continuing the conversation, bringing in articles about topics that I’ve never even thought about,” said Hirschler.\n“There’s a difference between then and now, because I feel like Andover’s a lot more aware of these issues,” said Qu.\nEditor’s Note: Maia Hirschler was the Front Page Editor for The Phillipian, Vol. CXXXV, and Jing Qu was the Director of Production for The Phillipian, Vol. CXXXV.\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nIntersectionality—the idea that class, race, gender and other aspects of identity are linked—is an issue addressed by the Feminism is Equality (F=E) movement at Andover.\n“Intersectionality focuses more on the idea how, when we define women, we define women who have a really broad spectrum of experiences,” said Rani Iyer ’15.\nKayla Thompson ’15 said that, because of the concept of intersectionality, people can have better and more cohesive conversations about identity.\n“I think too often in history people have not been able to sufficiently advocate for themselves because they’re so splintered between different minority groups, so they don’t collaborate with one another,” said Thompson.\nFor Iyer, intersectionality allows the feminist movement to reach all women, regardless of background or identity.\n“[Without intersectionality], the movement is incomplete, and you’re not helping all women. [You’re] just helping one set of women, and that is not really helpful to our campus and to inclusivity,” said Iyer. Thompson believes having more programs like Afro-Latino-American Society (Af-Lat-Am), which is a support and mentoring program catered to helping African-American and Latino-American students, will help women of color, who are not only African-American or Latino-American, feel more comfortable at Andover.\n“I think being a woman of color at Andover is a unique experience, because on one hand there is a feeling like the school wasn’t founded for you, like the school is founded for white, upper-middle class, protestant, heterosexual males. I guess that kind of isolation is hard to deal with… In the future, it would be awesome if there were more conversations and more mentorship between women of color,” said Thompson.\n\n featured \n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nGrowing up in a household with a working mother and a stay-at-home father, Corinne Singer ’15 experienced the effects that inverted gender roles can have on a home, developing a clear sense of equity and an urge to promote justice at a young age.\nThe Feminism Equals Equality movement (F=E) was started during the Spring Term of Singer’s Lower year, allowed her to understand what she was experiencing on a systematic level.\n“It was a big ‘aha’ moment for me. I finally understood how to essentially connect all those things that I had observed in a way that made sense and had a really big impact,” said Singer.\nSince the movement was first initiated, Singer has been a self-proclaimed feminist. Her role as a Lower in the F=E movement ranged from attending weekly forums and meetings at the house of Jennifer Elliott, Instructor in History and Dean of Abbot Cluster, to interacting with Seniors in charge of organizing and planning the F=E faculty presentation at the end of Spring Term 2013.\n“Through having conversations with older students about these [issues] and faculty members, I was completely transformed as a person in terms of feminism and my overall character. I think that dissolving the movement has been effective in that more people feel comfortable accessing it, but the issue with dissolving the movement is that it sent a message that feminism is more a lifestyle than a collective movement,” said Singer.\n“While feminism can and does exist on an individual level in terms of people using it as a lens through which they perceive everything, it’s vital that people still recognize feminism as a collective global movement, otherwise individualistic interests on a person-to-person basis take priority,” she added.\nSinger has faced criticism for her feminist beliefs. She believes that activists can be an easy target for criticism.\n“It’s quite easy for people to directly attack activists because their entire lives have been conditioned by these really oppressive systems that construct a certain reality that activists directly challenge. For a person’s entire reality or notion of reality to challenged in such a strong way is quite a jarring experience,” said Singer.\nIn dealing with criticism, Singer recognizes the importance of other activists’ support, as well as the importance of creating safe spaces where people can challenge each other’s beliefs, but have their beliefs be respected.\nSinger hopes to continue to fight for social justice an  gender equality at Barnard College next fall, and work on her photography.\n“[Barnard] is an all-women’s college, and they’re becoming more inclusive. I think that women’s colleges should eventually evolve into places that are open to anybody that experiences gender oppression,” said Singer.\nCurrently using photography as a medium through which she can communicate feminist ideas, Singer hopes to continue working artistically on feminism at Barnard.\n“I read a lot of feminism theory and let it inspire my photography. I think that transforming popular feminist theory and some of my own experiences in conjunction to that theory through photography is really helpful and powerful for people to see through a visual lens. It’s easier for people to look at photographs than to read tons of theory, so I’m hoping that I can introduce feminism to people just through that work,” said Singer.\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nEntering Andover as a new Lower, Jaleel Williams ’15 soon joined Women’s Forum (WoFo) and began learning about the different facets of feminism and the various intersections that the movement has with other social issues. Williams, who went on to become the co-president of both WoFo and Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), strove to educate others about the nuances of gender identity and the misconceptions people tend to believe.\nWilliams highlighted the inclusivity of the feminist movement as its most captivating aspect.\n“I’ve always had a very interesting relationship with gender… feminism appealed to me very early on as something that [is] easily associated with anyone,” said Williams.\nWilliams identifies as transgender, non-binary, and genderqueer.\n“Transgender is a word to define anyone whose gender identity doesn’t match the one they were assigned to at birth. I was assigned male at birth (which meant that society determined I was a man, and I’m not one)… Non-binary just goes to say that I don’t fit into the binary system of male versus female; I’m neither male nor female. And then genderqueer, which is probably the most specific, sort of places me somewhere [in the middle] of the spectrum of masculinity and femininity. So, even though I’m neither male nor female, I do align myself somewhere on a spectrum of masculine and feminine,” said Williams.\nPicture a triangle. Place femininity at one of its points, masculinity at another, and agender––or lack of a gender––at the third. All people, said Williams, are somewhere on this two-dimensional spectrum, whether their gender identity lands directly at one pole, hedged between two, or even right in the middle of all three.\n“We live in a world in which our minds are formed from the moment we’re born around the concept of gender and how that concept impacts the physical and mental and emotional things around us… Because of that, everything has a gender and that gendering of the world around you has a very physical and real impact on your brain and the way you think,” said Williams.\nWilliams’s first involvement in the feminist movement came in the form of an eighth grade history paper.\n“I had written a history paper about the act of footbinding in China, and my argument was that we shouldn’t be vilifying the women in China for foot binding because that cultural practice was remarkably similar to the beauty standards and the acts of [painful beautification] that we force on women in the West, including plastic surgery and other harmful and painful and generally not healthy acts of violence that you have to do to perpetuate these beauty standards,” said Williams.\nOutside of Andover, there’s still room for improvement, said Williams. Williams believes that feminism as a movement needs to be more welcoming of the trans* community. Marginalized by their inability to adhere to society’s constructs, trans* people are sometimes seen as the invisible population, excluded from the equality-for-all-genders conversation, William said.\n“If you’re thinking about gendered hierarchy, trans people are at the bottom. What’s hard with trans issues a lot of the times is just the fact that people don’t include trans women and trans men,” said Williams.\nIn particular, Williams hopes that feminism will soon be able to grapple with the idea of sex and gender being different entities. The movement, founded by establishing the core differences between the expectations of men and the expectations of women, falls short in its inclusion of trans* people, simply because of the complication trans* people raise to the binary.\nLooking to continue participating in social activism, Williams plans to opt for a more relaxed role within the movement rather than being in charge.\nEditors Note: The term trans shares the definition of transgender, but the asterisk serves as an active way to represent individuals who do not identify with the binary whom are not always immediatly thought of as under the ‘transgender’ umbrella”tity spectrum according to Jaleel Williams.*\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nAlthough Ellie Simon ’15 has loved chess since the age of five, she became disheartened as she grew older when noticed that she was one of the few girls participating in chess tournaments.\nNoting the lack of female players at competitive chess tournaments, Simon, who stopped competing at the age of 14, decided to research and explore the reasons why the ratio of boy to girl players grew increasingly imbalanced as individuals aged, and she presented her findings at her Brace Fellow Presentation in the Mural Room last Friday.\n“When I would sit down for a match, people would say, ‘Are you saving this seat for your dad?’ or, ‘You play well for a girl.’ I didn’t really pick up on those [comments] for a while, but they’re all implying this underlying mentality in the chess world, which is that girls aren’t good at chess,” said Simon in her presentation.\nIn her research, Simon found the ratio of boy to girl chess players to be 16:1, and that women only make up one percent of the top chess players in the world. Her initial hypothesis proposed that girls perceived more negative social feedback from their peers for playing chess and that the pervasiveness of such stereotypes led to a subconscious belief in them.\n“What I found was that I was half-right. Yes, girls were the most aware of such stereotypes, but they also disagreed with the stereotypes more than any other cohort, which is a positive thing. The retired girls perceive the stereotype the most, which is a strong indication that [the stereotype] was a reason why they quit,” said Simon.\nIn addition to these negative stereotypes, Simon found three other factors that determine why girls quit playing chess: a lack of confidence, personality differences between boys and girls and social factors. “The game of chess is just naturally masculine. If you think about it, it’s very bellicose. You have two teams with medieval fighters who are trying to beat the other. The main objective of the game is to attack and gain your opponent’s king, which is a masculine piece,” said Simon.\nAfter surveying both active and retired female chess players, Simon came to the conclusion that overcoming the gender barrier in chess will turn the game into a more positive experience for girls.\n“Girls are actually enjoying [chess] more than the boys are, out of the people that I surveyed. A study I looked at showed that female chess players are more satisfied with life, had fewer physical complaints, and a higher achievement motivation than the normal population, which is kind of ridiculous. Overcoming this barrier has the potential to transform your life into a better thing,” said Simon.\nSimon found that overcoming the gender barrier could provide a solution for getting more girls involved in chess and assist in balancing the gender ratio.\n“The fact is that it’s this unbalanced gender ratio that’s leading girls to feel like they don’t belong [in the chess world] and that they don’t have support. Breaking that is the way to bring more girls into chess and get more female coaches. That can be increased by awareness, but is also just a problem that needs to be solved,” said Simon.\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nOver the weekend, Andover hosted its first Social Justice Institute Conference, a two-day overnight event that assembled students from various boarding schools to explore issues of privilege. More specifically, the program focused on issues of privilege pertaining to race, class, gender and sexual orientation at boarding school campuses and in America as a whole.\nThea Rossman ’15 and Devontae Freeland ’15 worked alongside a team of young adult activists from Boston Mobilization to lead the weekend’s events.\nActivities ranged from workshops on racial and gender terminology to real-life simulations of how public school funding works in America.\n“I think [the conference] was a great tool for [educating] our students on the language to have these conversations. We have heard a lot of young people that, even when they are interested in having conversations about race or gender, they don’t necessarily have the language to do so,” said LaShawn Springer, Associate Director of College Counseling and incoming Dean of the Community and Multicultural Development office.\nStudents were split into “family” groups of ten people, reconnecting at the end of activities to share their thoughts and experiences.\n“There is a lot of trust-building work [in the family groups], not only thinking and learning about systems of oppression but also tapping into our own feelings, helping us understand our own privileges and thinking about what we need in instances where we are in groups that are normally oppressed in our paradigm of power,” said Springer.\nFor some of the workshops, students were split into affinity groups, first by race and then by the gender with which they identified.\nIn one activity, underrepresented students of color who identified as girls had to silently line themselves up based on skin tone from lightest to darkest, in order to provoke reflections about colorism—discrimination based on skin color—within the African American and Latino community.\n“I think [the affinity groups] provided a safe space where people felt they could speak more openly about their experiences as a person of a specific race or gender on an independent campus,” said Lydia Fikru ’17, a student who attended the conference.\nAnother activity titled “Theatre of Oppression” involved seven students of color lining up on the opposite side of seven white students. They had to recall a moment that they either witnessed, perpetrated or experienced an act of racism and made a short action or sound to represent it.\n“The overall understanding of the types of privilege which males in America have as opposed to women [stood out to me], specifically the privilege which cisgender males have…the focus on the intersections of gender and race helped me get out of my comfort zone and be educated on something which is important on campus and something that I necessarily don’t think about everyday,” said Jair Suazo ’17, who attended the conference.\nFor an activity centered around gender, students stood next to each other in a line while statements about social privilege were read. If the statement was applicable, they had to move a step forward. By the end, cisgender boys were far ahead, cisgender girls were a few steps in front of where they started and transgender students were still at the starting line.\n“It was very powerful illustration of the issues that exist for transgender and gender non-binary people,” said Theo Perez ’16, a participant in the conference.\nStudents were split into genders for the overnight portion of the conference, with boys sleeping in Kemper Auditorium and girls in Abbot Campus classrooms.\n“[The conference] encouraged students to create networks across institutions which I think is a really powerful piece in all of this because students no longer feel they are alone doing this on their campus, they feel like they have other students that they can turn to for advice and as soundboards as they continue to work through these issues [of social justice] on their campuses,” said Springer.\nAs the conference came to a close on Sunday afternoon, students regrouped with their respective schools to discuss how to implement the information they had gained into the everyday lives of students.\nA total of 60 students participated in the conference. The 25 Andover students who attended joined students from Choate Rosemary Hall, Northfield Mount Herman (NMH), Phillips Exeter Academy, Concord Academy, St. Paul’s School, Governor’s Academy and Milton Academy.\nSpringer will be looking at how clubs and organizations on campus can further incorporate multiculturalism so that they could be more representative of the Andover community.\n“[I attended the conference because] I was thinking about it a lot in terms of my role as Co-President next year and the issues which exist on campus… As someone who is meant to represent and help out the student body, it seemed foolish to me to not take an opportunity to learn more about issues of social justice and diversity,” said Perez.\nThe conference, which was funded by an Abbot Grant, will be held again each year for the next three years.\n“I hope [the students] all walked away feeling empowered and like they are change agents within their communities. Watching them go through this training over the past few days, I feel really good and confident about the work we can continue to do together,” said Springer.\n\n', 'May 22, 2015'), ('\nRobert Cushman Barber ’68 has always been a bridge-builder: as a Senior at Andover, he and a few friends started the “Sunday Morning Breakfast Club,” which allowed for informal dialogue between students and faculty over breakfast in the Log Cabin. Today, he will apply these communication skills to his new role as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Iceland.\nBarber, who was sworn in on January 8 by Vice President Joe Biden, credits his years at Andover as a formative time for him, saying that it was a “wonderful, eye-opening experience” and made a “significant difference” in his life.\nArriving at Andover in the fall of 1966 as a new Upper, Barber’s transition to the school was eased by the Blue Key Society, inspiring him to join the Society himself. In addition to being a Blue Key, the future Ambassador was a strong athlete in his two years at Andover, earning three varsity letters in lacrosse and wrestling. In general, Barber said, his time at Andover “changed the direction of [his] life.”\nAfter Andover, Barber attended Harvard College, graduating in 1972 along with 41 other Andover students in his class, and then earned a J.D. from Boston University and a master’s in city planning from Harvard.\nAfter finishing graduate school, he entered the world of law and public service as an Assistant District Attorney for New York County in Manhattan, a position he held from 1977 to 1981, before working as a lawyer at Looney and Grossman, a Boston-based law firm, for 33 years.\nBarber has stayed closely connected to Andover since graduating, serving most recently as a board member of the Abbot Academy Association. After his appointment as Ambassador, however, he had to leave this position, but remains fond of his alma mater, he said.\nThe White House asked Barber to serve as the United States Ambassador to Iceland in October 2013, but he was not officially confirmed until December 2014. As a result, he was not sworn in until January.\nBarber said that, as his confirmation process continued and he learned more about Iceland, he became more excited to represent the U.S. Government abroad.\nPrior to his appointment, Barber had never been to Iceland, but he departed for the country shortly after being sworn in. Barber said that he found Iceland to be “stunningly beautiful” and described it as a “small country with outsized issues.” \nOne of Barber’s favorite new hobbies has been to explore Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, and interact with Icelandic citizens.\n“Icelanders as a people are extremely friendly, down-to-earth, authentic, fun… and very entrepreneurial,” said Barber.\n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nAfter seeing incidents of sexual assault publicized in the media, Alex Dziadosz ’16 and Payton Jancsy ’16 approached Lisa Joel, Associate Dean of Admissions, for help in bringing the “It’s On Us” campaign to Andover’s campus.\n“It’s on Us,” a White House-led initiative originally focusing on college campuses, asks members of communities to pledge to be active participants in the fight to end sexual assault.\n“This is such an important time in everyone’s life here at Andover. Everyone is growing as students, and being away from your home and from your parents can sometimes make campus a scary place. If we all do our part in making it as safe as possible, it will make everyone enjoy their experience at [Andover] more,” said Jancsy.\n“We want to spread awareness of how students can be active in preventing and fighting against sexual assault and just really making Andover as safe and welcoming to everyone as possible,” Dziadosz added.\nThe “It’s On Us” pledge entails a long-term commitment to sexual assault prevention.\n“[This initiative] has to be more than a one day awareness campaign. We must keep this conversation going, and most importantly, create an environment that makes sexual assault, gender-based violence of any sort entirely unacceptable. Once you leave Andover, the hope is you bring this awareness and this mindset to the next community you enter,” said Joel.\nAfter Joel accepted the pair’s proposal, she collaborated with Dziadosz and Jancsy in the development and implementation of the “It’s On Us” initiative on campus.\n“The key thing in my mind is that this was student-initiated. That is how real change takes place. The adults can put powerful programs in place that we feel are important to educate students on essential topics, but when it is students who take the lead, that is when I believe we are going to make the best headway,” wrote Joel in an email to The Phillipian.\nWith the hopes of spreading awareness of the campaign around campus, Dziadosz and Jancsy sold blue T-shirts imprinted with the “It’s On Us” logo. Dziadosz, Jancsy and Joel received more support than they initially expected, and they hope that students use this opportunity to take action in preventing sexual assault, they said.\n“Taking the pledge is one thing, but then starting to actually live your life that way and create a community in which everyone does their part in stopping sexual assault is the most important. So there’s talking the talk, and then there’s everyone doing their part and walking the walk,” said Jancsy.\nJoel added, “It is one thing to know about a problem, or in this case, a crisis, but what is going to make the difference is what we all do to prevent sexual assault. The campaign demands that we become active bystanders—that we know what being an active bystander means.”\n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nGrandparents from all across the globe arrived on campus for a day packed with lessons, speakers, athletic competitions and food. Grandparents’ Day, held last Saturday, welcomed over 300 grandparents to campus, entertaining them with mock classes and a talent show.\nGreeted with a light breakfast and coffee at registration in the Underwood Room, grandparents checked in at 9 a.m. and signed up for classes of their choice. Visitors had the option to choose astronomy, ornithology, English or Russian classes held in their respective academic buildings. They also had the opportunity to explore the art collection at the Addison Gallery of American Art or examine skeletal remains of a supposed German mercenary at the Robert S. Peabody Museum. They also signed up for a student-led campus tour. \n“For Grandparents’ Day, my grandmother on my mother’s side came to visit, as well as my aunt. I hadn’t seen them in a few months, so it was great to spend some time with people who I don’t usually get to see,” said JayShawn Fuller ’17.\nMany grandparents made the trek to Gelb Science Center to learn about Andover’s astronomy program in the Observatory Deck. Looking through the state-of-the-art telescope, grandparents examined the rays of the sun through the lens.\nAfterwards, Paresky Commons opened its doors for a hearty brunch, featuring baked ham, scalloped potatoes and plates of chocolate chip cookies. At 1 p.m., Head of School John Palfrey came to greet the grandparents in the Underwood Room. Soon after, grandparents were treated to a Student Showcase, featuring performances by a number of clubs and organizations. Azure and the Yorkies, two of the Showcase’s main acts, filled the auditorium with a cappella music.\nAddressing the grandparents before the Showcase, Palfrey said that Grandparents’ Day is one of his favorite occasions of the year, adding that he loves the opportunity to meet grandparents and share the special day with them. In his remarks, Palfrey expressed his gratitude for the many ways that grandparents contribute to their grandchildren’s educational experiences. \nTo finish the day, grandparents ventured out to the athletic fields and watched a number of home athletic competitions. From lacrosse to crew to cycling, almost every sports team went head-to-head on behalf of Andover: Blue Key Heads even encouraged some grandparents in the crowd to chime in with their loud cheers.\nStacy Gillis P ’15, ’17, ’19, Associate Director of Parent Development, who has helped run the event for the past two years, said that over 1000 grandparents were invited and over 100 students had grandparents attend.\n“Grandparents’ Day is always one of the most enjoyable events on campus, because grandparents are so excited to have the opportunity to share in their grandchildren’s Andover experiences and are always so proud,” said Gillis.\n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nFree tampons and pads have been placed the restrooms of eight buildings around campus, in a move initiated by Antonia Leggett ’15 as of Friday, May 8. \nThe tampons and pads will be housed in small organizers in Paresky Commons, Samuel Phillips Hall, Morse Hall, George Washington Hall, Bulfinch Hall, Isham Medical Center and Borden Gym. \nThe tampons are meant to be an emergency source, rather than a regular source, according to an email to The Phillipian from Andrea Orben, Isham Health Educator, who helped Leggett with the project. They are meant to accompany and replace the currently unstocked coin-fed tampon dispensers in bathrooms around campus. \nAfter seeing feminine products provided in bathrooms at various peer schools, such as Phillips Exeter Academy, Leggett saw a lack of support for women at Andover in regards to addressing their needs. Without any hesitation, Leggett approached Head of School John Palfrey and informed him of this issue.\n“When I told [Palfrey] that [other schools] provided tampons and pads for free in public bathrooms, and our school did not, he was very surprised. He didn’t even know we had tampon and pad machines, and he didn’t know we had to pay for them. He was completely unaware of the need,” said Leggett.\nPalfrey followed up by contacting Christopher Joel, Director of Business Services. They both helped fund the project while Leggett and Orben were responsible for the planning and execution.\nLeggett and Orben also distributed posters in various bathrooms across campus, providing viewers with facts about menstrual health.\n“I thought [making these posters] was really great, because I thought that people’s knowledge about menstrual and vaginal health is really varied. I thought providing these posters is another way to get a source of education while using the bathroom,” said Leggett.\nAfter observing how free feminine products are available in public bathrooms at peer schools, Leggett looked at the feminist issues tied with the lack of tampon options on campus. Free tampons are a representation of women taking charge and making their own decisions, and topics such as menstruation and periods should not be shamed and hidden from the public view, she said. \n“People often feel extremely uncomfortable discussing menstruation in public spheres. I hope that by bringing this [project] to campus, the common reaction of shock or disgust when any mention of periods comes up can be eliminated. When I see other schools providing pads and tampons for free in the restrooms, it is clear that there is someone in power who is looking out for the interests of women. Up until now, it looked as if the machines in the restrooms hadn’t been filled in years, though the need for these products has been consistent,” said Leggett.\nIn regards to the future of this initiative, Leggett hopes to expand the program to accommodate for people with female genitalia who do not identify as female. With the goal of inclusivity in mind, Leggett looks to provide tampons to all gender-neutral bathrooms.\nFurthermore, she hopes the initiative will continue on its own after she graduates.\n“Right now is just the pilot of the project. We just started out with a few locations on campus for the single sex bathrooms, but soon it will hopefully expand… At this point, now that the wheels are turning on this project, it will hopefully just be a matter of making sure each year that the resources are allocated accordingly, and that the janitorial staff is informed so that they know how often and in what quantities the resources need to be restocked. I’m pretty sure it shouldn’t need any more momentum from students,” said Leggett.\n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nOver the course of two days, nine Andover students spent nine hours working on six mathematical problems as part of the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). \nAmy Chou ’16 and JongHo Park ’16 participated in the USAMO, for which around 270 students in the nation qualify each year. Michael Ren ’18, Tyler Shen ’17, Elizabeth Tso ’18, Andrew Wang ’18, Albert Yue ’17, Siye (Annie) Zhu ’17 and Valerie Zhang ’17 competed in the USAJMO, which is taken by around 230 students.\n“It feels nice to be among really motivated people who are interested in math and who would prepare for these competitions too. It’s a common goal, it’s a shared interest. There’s a really nice feeling about seeing people at math competitions who you would know from going to other math competitions with,” said Chou.\nDuring the nine-hour USAMO competition, students attempt to solve six essay or proof-style mathematical questions.\n“Usually, on an Andover test, you show your solution, but for this one, you really need rigorous formal proof writing. It’s contest math, which is a lot different from school math too. You don’t know what topics are going to be on the test before you take it. And these problems are original problems. There has never ever been a problem [like it] before,” said Chou.\nThe USAJMO is similar to the USAMO but for younger students. The USAJMO problem set involves a combination of the essay-style problems of the USAMO and problems that require students to generalize an answer to an open ended question.\n“For the Olympiad… I did do some practice ones because my math coaches always told me the best way to prepare for something is to do problems that are harder,” said Tso.\nTso decided to participate in math competitions all through middle school, having discovered her passion for math at an early age.\n“Math is something which, if given enough time, given enough preparation and dedication and hard work, that you can really excel in. Not enough girls do this, so I thought that I could try and represent my gender and do something in the math world, because I love it,” said Tso.\nIn order to qualify for the USAMO, competitors must be among the top 270 scoring participants in the AMC 12, another math competition for students in 12th grade or below. For the USAJMO, competitors must place among the top 230 scoring participants in the AMC 10, a math competition similar to the AMC 12 but for students in tenth grade or lower. The top percentile of students in the AMC 12 and the AMC 10 are invited to take the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). The combined scores of the AMC and the AIME are used to determine the students who are invited to compete in the USAMO and the USAJMO.\nRen, who was one of only two ninth graders in the nation to obtain a 14 out of 15 on the AIME exam, “I’ve always enjoyed doing math and problem solving, but doing competitions… allows for me to meet other people who share my interest in math… I like math because of how creative you have to be to solve challenging problems. Often times you have to think outside of the box or combine techniques from different areas to finish a solution.”\n“The USAMO is more challenging, a little bit more challenging than the USAJMO. It’s just in recognition that the tenth graders or the ninth and tenth graders have less experience and have less exposure than the 11th and 12th graders so they want to make sure that they give a challenging enough problem set but also reflect the differences,” said Khiem DoBa, Instructor in Math.\nThe top-scoring participants in the USAMO are invited to take part in the Mathematical Olympiad Summer program. From this program, six participants are chosen to represent the USA in the International Math Olympiads. In the past, Andover has had an average of six students competing in the USAMO and USAJMO every year. \n“We’ve had students who did very well in the USAMO and made the USA team and competed in the International Mathematical Olympiad. We’ll do that again, hopefully. We have a young team, but a very young and talented team so I’m very hopeful that we’ll do well in the next few years,” said DoBa. \n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nAfter highlighting American civil rights activists’ 1965 march from Selma, AL., to Montgomery, AL., and student-led strikes in Hong Kong in 2014 as examples of grassroots movements to change voting laws, Lawrence Lessig stressed the importance of combatting corruption in the modern voting system in the United States in his speech at All-School Meeting on May 6.\nLessig, the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School and Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, concentrated on the influence that funding has on public elections. His talk referred specifically to “Tweedism,” a political structure named after William “Boss” Tweed, a prominent New York politician in the 1800s.\n“Tweedism is any multiple stage election where the ‘tweeds’ get to control the first stage; we all get to participate in the last stage, and that control [creates] a system responsive to the ‘tweeds’ only,” Lessig said during his speech.\nLessig added that Thomas Jefferson wanted the United States to be a representative democracy, including an executive branch dependent on the people alone. Tweedism, however, creates a dependence on candidates’ financial backers, effectively disregarding Jefferson’s principle that the vote of each citizen should carry as much weight as the next.\nLessig explained that there are essentially two primaries in each election within the United States: the “green” primary, influenced by donors who determine who has the funds to run a successful campaign, and the subsequent primary open to the public. “A tiny fraction of the one percent dominates this first stage with a consequence: by producing a democracy responsive to the funders only, ” said Lessig.\nOnly 1.7 percent of Americans gave any amount of money to a congressional campaign, but of those funders, only 0.02 percent of the American population gave the maximum amount of $5,200, Lessig said.\n“If we have a system responsive to the funders, people who give $5,200 or more, then what we have is a system responsive to the rich more than the poor. We have produced precisely the inequality which the framers were driving against,” he continued.\nLessig said that, in order to solve the problem of the “green” primary, it is necessary to increase the general public’s role in financing elections. \n“We have to publicly finance elections. There are a couple ways of doing that – the way I support is the bottom-up public financing. One idea is matching funds, so small contributions get matched up to 9:1. The other idea is vouchers, where everybody has a voucher used to fund campaigns,” said Lessig in an interview with The Phillipian. \nTo illustrate the idea of vouchers, Lessig referenced a plan designed by Jim Rubens, a New Hampshire politician, that would remove all funding limits, but provide all citizens with a fifty-dollar voucher to assist the candidate of their choice.\n“Both of these are ways of bringing in millions of people to the funding of campaigns, away from a system where it is basically 5,000 who are the relevant funders,” Lessig said.\nHe continued, “I think this is the civil rights issue of our age. We have allowed our government to evolve to a place where we have fundamental inequality of citizenship, meaning citizens have a radically unequal role in influencing their government. The way we fund campaigns is just one part of it, but I think it is the most urgent part to solve right away.”\n\n', 'May 15, 2015'), ('\nReagan Posorske ’17, a two-year Lower from Phoenix, AZ., has outclassed every one of her opponents throughout her career on the Andover Girls Tennis team.

I think that I do a good job of getting my opponent off the court and being able to execute the shot so that the points go by quicker.\nWas it intimidating for you to come into Andover and immediately rise to the top of the ladder?\nYes. I thought it helped, though. Before my matches, I felt a lot of pressure. In the end, I went in and thought\nthat I had nothing to lose because I was a Junior, and I ended up winning every match. I think that it’s helped a lot this year because I know the girls that I’ve played and how to play them.\nDoes the fact that you’re so accustomed to winning ever make you nervous before matches?\nYes, I get nervous all the time before every singles match.

And you can say that you have to begin with forgetting how the story turned out. That’s one way to see with new eyes… [and] to force yourself to get down on the ground with people,” said Ayers during his presentation.\nAyers said he believes that the Civil War is oftentimes smoothed out and crafted into a cohesive story with clear turning points in which it was possible to guess which side would win. In reality, the story is much more rough and ragged, he said.\n“Get past the stories to the actual things underneath. Read the actual letters and diaries, newspapers [from] the time. They’re not hard to find now online. You can find all that stuff. See the story for yourselves with your own eyes, rather than just taking what the books tell you,” said Ayers.\nThroughout his presentation, Ayers focused on two major portions of the Civil War: the Battle of Gettysburg and the Emancipation Proclamation.\nWhile many history books portray the Battle of Gettysburg as a major turning point, marking the beginning of the end of the Civil War, Ayers argued that, in reality, Gettysburg settled nothing. The soldiers involved in the battle had no idea how the battle and the war would end.\n“This is part of the larger theme of seeing with fresh eyes. Get as close to the ground and see the original sources, and you’ll see the story that I’m talking about, which is that people are making this up as they go along. If you know that, then it’s a lot more interesting,” said Ayers.\nIn addition, Ayers discussed the Emancipation Proclamation, which is often viewed as “the document that freed the slaves,” he said. Once again, Ayers urged the audience to look beyond what the document says and in order to grasp the perspective of the slaves.\n“The Emancipation is not Abraham Lincoln signing a scroll setting people free. [It] is African American persons with [their] lives at stake getting themselves free,” said Ayers.\nThrough these two important events during the Civil War, Ayers illustrated his main idea that the Civil War is far more complex than it often seems. He also described the cause for which the Confederacy fought and the ways in which it is often misrepresented.\n“[The Confederacy] did not necessarily charge into battle shouting about slavery. Its generals never exhorted them to fight over slavery. The fact that the nation they fought to create was based on slavery was not the rallying cry, but it was the foundation of everything else… They did not fight for slavery. They fought for a nation based on slavery,” said Ayers.\nHe also explained that, prior to the end of the Civil War, only two percent of the American population were abolitionists, but many citizens claimed afterwards that they had been abolitionists all along.\n“The fact is that it was a close call every second of the way. [It was] the people who actually stuck their necks out and made things happen… Some people made history move. Other people were doing their best to stop history from moving in a forward direction,” said Ayers.\nAt the end of his presentation, he connected the historical events to the current news regarding rioters in Baltimore that are pushing to end police brutality.\nAshley Scott ’16, an audience member, said, “My biggest take-away was that the Civil War ended technically – Appomattox did happen, there were documents that were signed, of course – but the fight and the struggle haven’t really ended. When he tied it back to the things that are happening in Baltimore, the most important thing to me was that… the oppression of an entire group of people as citizens, not just as slaves, began because these people are freed with literally the shirts on their backs and nothing else.”\nAyers has written four books and has won the Bancroft Prize for distinguished writing in American history. He was brought to speak at Andover by the History Department. \n“One of the most important things that everyone should probably take away … is that there’s a really important connection between remembering the Civil War and remembering the history of the emancipation and the legacy of the war… The legacy of the slave system that was ended because of that war is tremendously resonant in American history and in contemporary American society,” said Chris Jones, Instructor and Chair in History.\n\n', 'May 1, 2015'), ('\nDrawing from his intrigue in examining history through a philosophical lens, Noah Rachlin, Instructor in History, will teach a new elective in the fall of 2015 titled “Schooling in America.” \nThe class will study the history of schooling, examining the evolution of American education that brought it from the year 1980 to where it is now. After understanding the causation that built up to today’s system, the course will shift toward investigating the systemic problems that plague modern-day education, answering “big questions” about human nature, identity and the inner-workings of the schooling institution, said Rachlin.\n“For example: What’s the connection between poverty and schooling––whether it’s poverty and school funding, or poverty and school preparedness? How do we think about measuring schools? What is a ‘good’ school? How do you know it’s a ‘good’ school? Should we be measuring at a systemic and organizational level or should we be measuring at a more focused level of teachers? How do we collect that data? What do we do with that data?” said Rachlin.\n To spark awareness about their surroundings at school, Rachlin will charge students to think critically about the different aspects of schooling that they hear about and encounter with each day.\n“By intellectualizing schooling and its intersections with today’s major social issues, students will break the educational system apart into its different components, inspecting the causation behind school-related problems and then thinking of solutions to move forward,” said Rachlin.\n “[School] is the intersection of race, it’s the intersection of class, it’s the intersection of gender, it’s the intersection of economics, of [society], of psychology, of history; there are all of these forces that are at play,” he continued.\n Through teaching Schooling in America, Rachlin hopes to explore society’s value of schooling as both an equalizer and a divider. \n“Why are people struggling? They’re not getting a good education. What’s the key to that? They need a good education. There’s this tension here, so my contention is that if we are to understand that, we also have to understand where we got to the place we are and then sort of dig into where we are [now].” \n“My idea is to structure a curriculum and a syllabus that provides information about the areas that people might not be as aware of or might not know enough about, while also providing opportunities for people to leverage and share their own experiences and their own understandings and their own ideas,” said Rachlin.\nWhen he was in graduate school studying for a degree in education, Rachlin was surrounded by people who came from all different walks of life and offered perspectives of their educational experiences that he had never been introduced to. The individuality of each person’s story and the complexity of the schooling system fascinated Rachlin, driving him to design an outlet for students to enter the education conversation as well. \nAs arguably the greatest unifier between different people, the experience of being a student is one of the few ways that could singlehandedly connect a sizable group of people, said Rachlin. But Rachlin contends that people look at the schooling through a pinhole, seeing only their own perspective and, as a result, miss the fact that education is more nuanced and complex system.\n“Some students choose schools, such as [Andover], because it represents a ‘great opportunity.’ But, an opportunity to do what? We should think about what that means and what it also means that this is a great opportunity but it’s also a great opportunity, by definition, for a limited number of people,” said Rachlin.\nThe course will be offered through the History and Social Studies Department, and will only be offered in the fall term.\n\n', 'May 1, 2015'), ('\nRunning on a newly discovered trail in Andover, Rachel Hyland, Instructor in Spanish, progresses into her hour-long workout, slowly picking up speed along the way. Ever since running on her sixth grade track team, Hyland has had a passion for running.\n“At this point, I’ve been running for so long, it just feels like part of who I am. I try to incorporate it into most days,” said Hyland.\nIn the classroom, as well as on the course, Hyland enjoys being on the move.\n“I relax when I’m on the move. That’s one of the reasons I like teaching. When I’m in the classroom, I’m moving around, and it’s a dynamic environment that relaxes and motivates me,” said Hyland.\nHyland has run five marathons including the Boston Marathon in 2012 and most recently a marathon in Philadelphia last fall. Currently training for the Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, MI., Hyland tries to incorporate running at least once a day into her weekly routine.\n“I do longer runs on Wednesdays and the weekends and between 6-10 [miles] on the other days of the week. [I’m] just trying to run a better time and enjoy it, as well as stay injury free,” said Hyland.\nThroughout her running career, Hyland has had no major injuries with the exception a stress fracture in 2013.\n“[The stress fracture] was the only big [injury]. To recover from a stress fracture, usually eight weeks of no running at all [is required]. You have to build up really slowly for the next four to five months,” said Hyland.\nTo train off campus, Hyland travels to Boston every Wednesday to run with the Boston Athletic Association, a running club located in Boston.\n“They have a club team and a competitive team. I race for them a couple times a year and they have a great community of runners outside of Andover,” said Hyland.\nWhile on her runs, Hyland enjoys discovering new trails, as well as running on certain loops around campus.\n“I love running with people, and I love running with the team on campus. I find it’s a good way to be social with friends and my husband,” said Hyland.\nSince running for Williams College, Hyland has coached track and cross-country at the Millbrook School and at Andover since she joined the faculty in 2010.\n\n', 'May 1, 2015'), ('\nInstead of drinking tap water from regular fountains or buying disposable plastic water bottles, students have been able to make a simple trek to the nearest hydration station to drink cooled, filtered and dispensed water since last May. With a track record of 19,000 gallons of water saved so far, the hydration stations that provide cooled portable tap water have made substantial contributions to campus environmental sustainability.\n“The hydration stations provide a way to obtain fresh water without contributing to waste associated with plastic water bottles that often end up in landfills. [They] are more energy efficient and have more sophisticated filter systems that provide a better quality of water,” said Casey Russo, Capital Project Manager, in an email to The Phillipian. \nOver the course of last year, these stations have been installed by the Office of the Physical Plant (OPP) in various water fountains across campus, including the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), the Borden Gym, Morse Hall, Cochran Chapel, Pearson Hall, Graves Hall, Elbridge Stuart House, an upperclassmen boys’ dorm, and George Washington Hall. The first station was implemented last May, in the basement of Samuel Phillips Hall, with an Abbot Grant from Caroline Shipley ’16. \nThe common room sinks in the majority of the dorms have been modified to allow students to fill their water bottles, in an effort to reduce the number of disposable plastic water bottles.\n“The design is also primarily to provide a water bottle filling station in addition to a typical water fountain,” Russo continued. \nWhen plastic bottles are thrown into the garbage, which 90 percent percent are, they can take anywhere from 400 to 1,000 years to decay, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n“Each station has a counter that registers the amount of times a bottle is refilled. If we assume that each count equals one bottle diverted from the landfill, more than 25,000 bottles have been diverted since the first station was installed in May of 2014,” said Russo. 11,750 bottles and counting have been saved in the OWHL alone since last May, and about 62 bottles are diverted each day, according to Environmental Coordinating Officers (ECOs).\nElkay, the company that makes the hydration stations, says that its product reduces the “aesthetic chlorine, taste and odor, particulate class I, and lead,” according to its website.\nAccording to Russo, each station costs $1,800 and additional costs vary depending upon the location in which it is installed.\n Russo said, “When plastic bottles can no longer be recycled, they are often burned, which can also release chlorine and dioxin into the air which may also be harmful to humans and animals.”\nHe added that the process of recycling bottles takes a considerable amount of energy and creates greenhouse gases that may harm the environment.\n“According to the Pacific Institute, the production process for one water bottle (including the plastic bottle, manufacturing, cap and packaging) requires approximately three liters of water,” said Russo.\nBased on that data, Andover has saved over 19,000 gallons of water so far and has also prevented carbon dioxide emissions associated with plastic bottle production.\n“The ECOs and the Eco Action Club plan to monitor the usage of the hydration stations and to develop an awareness campaign to ensure students are aware of this resource,” said Russo.\nRusso said that the ECOs and the Eco Action Club plan to monitor the usage of the hydration stations and to develop an awareness campaign to ensure students are aware of them. He added that although there are no current plans for installations in the future, new stations would definitely be considered if necessary. \n\n', 'May 1, 2015'), ('\nDiving into the garbage dumpsters, fully equipped from head to toe in white plastic jumpsuits, participants of Waste Audit sorted through mixed bags of garbage, picking out recyclable and organic materials from the rest. This project quantifies the amount and types of waste being generated by a community.\n“I decided to be in this activity because I have always been interested in projects concerning environmental sustainability and this [activity] seemed like a great way to get involved in a very basic entry level,” said Nicole Durrett ’17, who participated in Waste Audit.\nThroughout the day, Durrett especially enjoyed collecting and comparing data to that gathered during previous years’ Waste Audits. Some of the data included measurements of how much recycling and organic matter was in the trash and how much trash had been placed in the recycling bins.\n“This activity really forced me to think about how I dispose of my waste and how much our community doesn’t know yet about what they can or cannot recycle and how they can each make a huge impact on what sort of trace we leave on this Earth and how we can diminish our foot print,” said Durrett. \nClearing fields, sorting out donations and watching documentaries were among the other choices of activities that Andover students and faculty could participate in during last week’s Non Sibi Weekend. Like last year, the activities this year were all centered around a different theme unique to each class; Juniors worked with organizations that helped children and families, Lowers explored the environment and sustainability, Uppers worked with initiatives that combat hunger and promote health and Seniors assisted organizations that focused on homelessness and housing.\nEarly in the morning, Daniel Yen ’18 travelled with a different group of 24 students to Lowell, Mass. to volunteer at The Wish Project, an organization working to provide clean furniture, clothing, home and baby goods to 35,000 people in the Merrimack Valley each year.\n“The Wish Project was created by a volunteer woman who realized that a lot of services [helped] people in need but did not complement each other… so [the goal of the organization] was to pool all of these resources together so that there would be a more whole way to approach community service and help those in need. It is so great that there are people willing to do this,” said Yen.\nAlexis Lefft ’16 volunteered at the Greater Boston Food Bank. Her work took her off campus and into Boston, where she spent around two and a half hours organizing donated goods. \nLefft said, “I didn’t really know what [the choices] were and I was unfamiliar [with them] so I was open to anything… When I was younger I benefitted more, just because each year has a different focus and the focus set during my Junior year and Lower year were more appealing to me… I knew more about the issue at hand.”\nAs the coordinator for the Youth Development Organization community service, Lefft recognizes the importance that the school motto, “Non Sibi,” carries on campus. \n“I think if we’re going to have school off for Non Sibi [Weekend] then it should be an all-day thing. Personally, I think Non Sibi Weekend should be once a week, but that’s not feasible, I guess,” said Lefft.\nKaterina Toffoloni ’15 attended a talk about homelessness for the “Faces of Homelessness” program. In this program, three previously homeless people were invited to share their stories and perspective on being homeless. \n“Just hearing about how people can become homeless whether it be drugs, alcohol, abandonment really brought awareness to me. Also, the talk included how to deal and help with someone homeless on the street which I found very useful,” said Toffoloni. \nToffoloni was particularly struck by the power stereotypes have on the homeless, such as how the money given to the homeless is used to pay for alcohol or drugs.\n“That’s not always true. You could always help. You could always give them food, there’s always something small you could do to support them,” said Toffoloni.\nTo improve how Non Sibi weekend operates, Toffoloni feels as if the programs could have had lengthier descriptions.\n“[For] many of the activities, I didn’t have a good idea of what it was, so I could’ve maybe done something that I would’ve loved, I just didn’t know what it was,” said Toffoloni.\n*Editor’s note: This article was updated on May 2 at 6:40 pm to correct factual errors.*\n\n', 'May 1, 2015'), ('\nWalking along the impoverished streets of Vietnam as a 14-year-old in 1991, Vanessa Kerry ’95, co-founder and CEO of Seed Global Health, witnessed firsthand the lingering effects of the Vietnam War. The country was without electricity, people were not properly housed, and the hospital clinics had no medicine. Later in her life, Kerry’s memories of Vietnam motivated her quest to better the world’s health infrastructure.\nKerry was the keynote speaker during Wednesday’s “Non Sibi” All-School Meeting, focusing specifically on her work in Africa and her organization’s partnership with the Peace Corps, in addition to her experiences in Vietnam.\n“Between my first and second year in medical school, I went to Ghana and did a study looking at the completion rates of vaccines in children. I went to study how many of these kids had actually taken all three of the vaccine series they had been assigned,” said Kerry.\nWhile searching for a random sample for her study, Kerry was shocked to discover that the infrastructure in Ghana was so poor that there were no addresses that could help her find the women and children who were to participate in the study.\nHoping to find a solution to the shortage of doctors and nurses in resource-limited countries, Kerry worked with her colleagues to establish Seed Global Health, a non-profit organization that provides sustainable health education in these regions by way of volunteering medical professionals. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Peace Corps, Seed Global Health sends volunteer doctors and nurses to African countries for one year to provide care for local hospitals and clinics and to teach medical practices and procedures to the local people. \n“I continued this road of global health, [spending] time in Rwanda and Uganda [after going to Ghana]. What I kept seeing was that people were delivering care and then leaving, that they weren’t actually transferring things. They weren’t leaving things behind. So it was great for the two weeks that you had a physician or a nurse there who was providing care, but then they left and there was nothing left behind,” said Kerry during her speech. \n“What I love about Seed, and what I think is its most important thing and distinguishes it from many other program, is the idea that one doctor or one nurse will train a classroom, and each of those individuals will go on to train their own classrooms, and so forth,” she continued. “We’re not only enhancing the breadth and the quality of education these folks are receiving, but we’re also training the future generation of healthcare providers for the country.”\nRealizing the impracticality of volunteering for a year without a stable income, Kerry and the team at Seed built their program around a debt repayment plan, helping to reduce the costly burdens of medical school as an incentive to sign up.\n“We raise the funds in order to make it possible for loan repayment to be repaid, because the vast majority of health professionals carry some kind of debt. And we don’t just limit it to educational debt: we also wanted to include mortgages, because it turns out there’s a whole bunch of people who want to be engaged in this kind of service, but they can’t go if someone isn’t helping them pay for their car or pay for their house for the year they’re gone,” said Kerry. \nDuring Seed’s inaugural year in 2013, the organization managed to offset nearly $750,000 worth of debt for its 31 volunteers. For 2015, Seed is on track to pay off over $1,000,000 in debt for this year’s 42 volunteers.\nIn the organization’s first two years of operation, Seed Global Health completed service in Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. Kerry said that it plans to branch out to Ebola-stricken countries later this year.\nAfter graduating from Andover in 1995, Kerry studied at Yale University and then at Harvard Medical School, subsequently completing her residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2010.

Before the pair had even thought of a name, they pitched their idea to other girls and female faculty on campus. The immediate responses were very supportive, and “BOSS Magazine” was born.\nAlessandra Allen said that the strong enthusiasm of the publication’s initial supporters showed her that there would be no shortage of interest in the endeavor. “[‘BOSS Magazine’] is not born of a need. It’s born of a complete enthusiasm for these issues and these people and this community,” she said.\nThe magazine is divided into seven sections: Campus Politics, Monthly Spread, Health, Art, Recommendations, Respect and Slice of Life. Each of these sections aims to discuss feminism through a different lens.\n“[The goal is] to be a resource… for girls and all feminists on campus that look at campus through the lens of intersectionality and feminism [in a way] that everyone can appreciate and go to and be heard,” said Alessandra Allen.\nCampus Politics is an opinion section that deals with feminist issues, especially those specific to Andover. In a similar fashion, the Monthly Spread section consists of opinion articles, all of which are dedicated to one particular theme.\nThe Art section presents various forms of art, ranging from photography and paintings to poetry and prose, while Recommendations offers suggestions for feminist literature, movies and TV shows. \nHealth features more factual articles that are meant to inform the community about various health resources available on campus. The section also discusses topics that may have been left out of the Andover curriculum.\nLara Guvelioglu ’16, Copy Editor for the Health section, said, “We realized that the sex-ed pieces that we do in class don’t necessarily focus on [certain topics]… They try to educate us, but with the time limit and the classes being too crowded, it doesn’t always reach what it was meant to be, so we wanted to start that [section].”\nThe Respect section highlights influential women, students and faculty. In the first edition, “BOSS Magazine” will feature Rebecca Somer ’15, Student Body Co-President, and Sara Luzuriaga ’16, Editor in Chief of The Phillipian, vol. CXXXVIII. Slice of Life acts as the humor section of the magazine. While the section still focuses on important issues, Slice of Life will approach the topics from a humorous perspective.\nAlessandra Allen said, “I’m hoping that [Slice of Life] will grow into it’s own life. I don’t want people to read ‘BOSS’ only for that section, but I feel like it has a lot of potential as just a positive conversation and a way to approach topics on campus with a smile.”\n“BOSS Magazine” is currently focused on publishing the first edition of the magazine as well as writing a second edition to publish by the end of the school year. Once the magazine gets on its feet, Alessandra Allen hopes to publish one edition every month.\n“Everything is organic. If someone writes something funny, they can just submit it, and it’s not just generated by the editors. Right now we’ve been having to generate a lot by the editors, but we’re hoping that it will become more organic and submission-based later on,” she said.\nOver the summer, Alessandra Allen plans to create a website for “BOSS Magazine” that would focus on including alumni in the conversations surrounding feminism on campus.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nStudents peered over documents, flyers and propaganda buttons that detailed the career of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin as part of the Library, Archives and Museums initiative (LAMs) this past Tuesday. \nThe program, which was held in the Mural Room of Paresky Commons during lunch, allowed students to immerse themselves in the music of change, discover an unsung hero of the Civil Rights Movement and address the prevalence of Native American mascots in American sports. The exhibits on display featured a range of works, some of which dated back to the 1950s.\nThe LAMs workshop is a collaborative effort between the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), the Robert S. Peabody Museum, the W.B. Clift Music Library and the Addison Gallery of American Art that strives to educate students and faculty on past and present issues in our society.\nStephanie Aude, Instructional Librarian, said Rustin was known for using songs and slogans to achieve social change, and he helped organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rustin also studied nonviolent resistance in India and tutored Martin Luther King, Jr. on principles of nonviolent resistance.\nAude said, “When people think of nonviolent resistance, they think of turning the other cheek, not fighting back and being passive in the face of attack. This is the foundation of nonviolent resistance; the courage to stick with your beliefs when confronted by adversity and violence.”\nThe W.B. Clift Music Library’s table was populated by myriad examples of protest music, predominantly civil rights music accompanied by prison, mining and revolutionary music.\nCarl Johnson, Head Music Librarian at the W.B. Clift Music Library, said, “Music really just taps into something emotional. It can make people angry and inspire them at the same time. There is music about civil rights leaders being angry with racist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan but also talking about their freedom and looking forward to a better future.\nThe Addison’s exhibit explored the way in which captions can drastically alter and sway an audience’s opinion of a photo. The Addison displayed pictures from the Civil Rights Movement and pictures taken of Innu, Aboriginal natives of Quebec and Labrador.\nOne picture depicted James Meredith, a civil rights activist, attempting to drag himself off a highway after suffering a gunshot wound. The caption read “Grimacing in Pain.”\nAt the exhibit, students were asked to write captions for a picture of the Selma to Montgomery March and ‘The Soiling of Old Glory,’ a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a white teenager threatening a black man with an American flag on a flagpole.\nThe Peabody Museum’s display explored the use of Native Americans as mascots for sports teams. Pictures depicted the many teams that used and still use Native Americans as their mascots and the racially offensive jokes made by those teams’ rivals.\nLindsay Randall, educator at the Peabody Museum, said, “Teams such as the Atlanta Braves are not said to be offensive. An argument in favor of the term ‘redskin’ is a Navajo school where the mascot is the redskins. This is why Washington Redskin supporters say that it is not meant to be offensive.”\nShe said, “‘Redskin’ means ‘proof of kill’ and this is one of the frequently used arguments against the [use of the] term. It is offensive to Native Americans.”\nThe next LAMs lunch is scheduled for Tuesday, May 12, and will focus on the preservation of archival materials.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nAfter many rounds of fast-paced buzzes and rapid responses, the Andover Quiz Bowl Team placed sixth overall in the Massachusetts National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT) State Championship at MIT two weeks ago on April 11, qualifying for two more national competitions scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, IL., later this year.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Cindy Ling ’15, President of the Quiz Bowl team, said, “Our main goal this year was to qualify for the nationals, and it is a huge accomplishment for us.

The app also creates a security blanket for the user, who is able to know that their friends are also looking out for them.\nHaving had previous experience in computer science class, Neogi said that she was looking for a way to continue coding outside of the classroom when she became interested in the Technovation challenge. Incentivized by the chance to work with friends, work on her coding skills and make an app useful to the Andover community, Neogi immediately signed up when she heard that the Computer Science Department was offering the challenge.\nNutting and Lin, heading the business side of Team Seventh, are in the process of creating a marketing presentation for their app as well as developing a clear and detailed business strategy for The Pack’s future.\nTeam Seventh hopes that everyone using their app will feel even just a little bit safer knowing that they can rely on their friends to watch their backs. \n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nOver the long weekend, five exchange students from the SESC High School in Rio de Janeiro stepped onto campus as part of the Brazil PLACES program. They will attend classes and stay with host families while working on a project they will present to the students at SESC.\n“The project is all based on how we learn music in our boarding school, to compare Brazil and our school with here, how it’s different,” said Guilherme Tarini, one of the students from SESC.\nBefore arriving on campus, the students, seniors at their school, were given their choice of classes to take. Although they are not expected to complete course homework, they are encouraged to learn as much as possible until their departure on May 1.\nA member of their faculty also came along as a chaperone and will look into the music department at Andover. He hopes to bring some of the ideas he learns on campus back to SESC and incorporate it into their curriculum.\nFrom the perspective of the students, an important factor in their decision to sign up for the exchange program was to experience a different country and a different culture. For many of them, this is their first time abroad, and many of them were surprised by what they’ve experienced.\n“To be somewhere where your mother language is not spoken is very different, and it’s very interesting. The culture is completely different. For example, your time of dinner is very different from our time of dinner. We have dinner at 7 or 8 p.m., and here it’s 6 p.m.,” said Leticia Gonzalves, another exchange student.\nTheir favorite experience, however, has been staying with their host families. Although it has been only a few days since their arrival, they have already had stories to share, and they were most excited by the prospect of visiting Boston over the weekend with their host families. \n“When I arrived there, there was a poster on my bed like, ‘Welcome, Sergio!’ That’s so cute, right? They were really easygoing, and I talked with them about Brazilian culture, and they talked to me about American history. They were nice. They were really, really nice,” said exchange student Sergio Espinoza.\nNow in its second year, the PLACES program was established after Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English, was introduced to SESC and visited the school on a trip to Brazil. After several years of faculty exchanges, the decision was made to include students in the partnership, with seven Andover students and two faculty members visiting Brazil in August.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\n Team “Girl Code” wanted to help students feel more comfortable in discussions about identity by giving them the correct terminology to do so. In order to achieve this, their app, called “InLingo,” is a dictionary for these kinds of terms. \n“They’re terms based on sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, and gender… a lot of online resources are unreliable, and dictionaries have very outdated terms.” said Avery Kim ’17, a member of the team.\nThe members of Girl Code are Candy Chan ’17, Cindy Espinosa ’18, Kim, Mia LaRocca ’16 and Alexa Pagano ’16.\nFrom the very beginning, the group agreed that they wanted to do something to aid and encourage dialogue on campus about identity. The problem lay in deciding on how to approach the issue and in what way they could help. \n“The best ideas come from looking at a problem and then trying to solve it, so we picked an idea that we were all passionate about, which was different aspects of identity, and went from there. We played around with the idea of a ‘forum’ to mirror the clubs and classes on campus, but we realized that in order to have those conversations, you need a working vocabulary,” Kim said. \nFor Kim, the issue of identity plagued her even before her arrival at Andover. She found herself unable to express herself simply because she could not find the right words to say. Now, she wants to help other people open up the way that she has.\n“I really struggled with my identity, and I didn’t understand a lot of terms surrounding identity. Coming here, just through discussion and listening and contributing, I realized so much, I became more comfortable in my ethnicity and my race, I came out as bisexual, and so it just felt like something right to do,” said Kim. \n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nAfter excavating and analyzing scattered bone remains at a plowing field in Indiana, Sarah Kiley Schoff, owner and founder of Cold Case FACTS, a Massachusetts-based forensic and archaeology consulting company specializing in human remains, visited the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology on Tuesday to present her research from the past summer.\nFor her research project in Indiana, Schoff placed six juvenile pigs that died of natural causes, four skeletonized and two mummified, on two separate fields. The pigs were arranged horizontally and the fields were then plowed with different intensity and orientation to test the different results.\n“Bone samples were used to estimate the distribution, damage and loss caused by normal agricultural practices in Indiana during the experiment, with the ultimate goal of better informing investigators in their search of recovery efforts,” said Schoff in an interview with The Phillipian.\nSchoff also described her career and passion for archaeology and forensics which she acquired from her dad, an amateur archaeologist, during her childhood growing up in Massachusetts.\n“My dad gave me the opportunity to learn about archaeology by [taking] me out to sites when I was a kid. He would always talk to me and try to help me figure out what happened to the animal, where the animal was from, what kind of animal it was and how it died… these are questions that I often ask now when I am on the fields in my work,” said Schoff.\nNow, as the owner and founder of Cold Case FACTS, in Boston, Mass., Schoff works to direct and decide the types of projects that her company will further investigate.\n“It’s very new, to me, being in this role, so I am just figuring it out, being a small business owner… it’s only been about a year now,” said Schoff.\nSchoff decided to speak on campus when she first came into contact with Andover as a member of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society. She was excited to share her experiences with her fellow chapter members.\n“I like opportunities to meet and discuss my research. I was really interested to hear the chapter members’ experiences with plow zones and archaeology… also, the archaeological history at the Peabody Museum is very well-known, and it is an honor to be accepted as a lecturer,” said Schoff.\nVictor Mastone, Director and Chief Archaeologist at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs and Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “I have been an archaeologist for 40 years, and I was really interested in looking at her plowing method. I was thinking more of the method having an effect on the artifact’s distribution than just natural forces.” \nSchoff graduated from the University of Maine with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology, and she is currently a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at the University of Florida.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nBiking along the alleyways of Soviet-occupied Riga, Latvia, on the morning of June 22, 1941, 16 year-old Max Michelson enjoyed the sun’s rays beating down on his skin and the homey view of the tightly-packed storefronts that he biked past every day. But the once peaceful day soon turned to chaos when Michelson’s father shared the tragic news that Nazi Germany had attacked the Soviet Union nearby and was en route to their Baltic hometown.\nMichelson vividly recalled this life-changing day for his audience in Cochran Chapel last Friday. \nOne of the last remaining survivors of the Holocaust, Michelson recounted his experience growing up in barbed wire-sealed ghettos and concentration camps. Michelson brought the listeners back to his adolescence in Latvia for a troubling trial of terror, torture and death.\nMichelson said that once the Nazi soldiers arrived in Michelson’s hometown, they overran the city and ruined the lives of thousands of Latvian Jews. The city, which Michelson remembered as teeming with life and energy, descended into deep anti-Semitic hatred.\n“Overnight, civilization for us disintegrated, and we were no longer human. Overnight, we were no longer human. We were caught in the streets and dragged from our apartments,” said Michelson. \nIn the early days of Riga’s occupation, the Nazis forced the Latvian Jews to complete tasks for the mere enjoyment of the spectacle, including scrubbing the blood-soaked streets with nothing but a toothbrush, Michelson said.\nOn July 9, 1941, the German police selected Michelson’s father to do work for them. His father, 60 years old and in poor health, had no chance of surviving the strenuous work, so Michelson’s mother, 51, stepped in instead.\n“We wondered if [my mother] could go to work in his place. ‘Sure’ the Germans said. And they took my mother away,” said Michelson. He never saw his mother again. \nWith the passing of Germany’s Nuremberg Laws, which sought to limit the rights of Jews, Michelson said that life in Riga quickly became regulated and restricted. He said Jews were treated like dogs on a leash and were escorted by non-Jews anywhere they went. \nMoreover, Jews, by decree of the Third Reich, were forbidden from walking on sidewalks and riding in street cars or buses and were required to wear a yellow star at all times.\nFocusing on a historically poor and Jewish quarter of the city, the Nazis rounded up all of Riga’s Jews, forcibly placing them inside a barbed wire-surrounded ghetto on October 25, which became known as the “Large Ghetto.” Inside the ghetto, Michelson’s father found a small two-room apartment that Michelson and his uncle decided to share with another family. \n“At the time, Germany seemed to be doing very well in the war. I never believed that they would win the war, but it was clear that the war was going to be a long haul. So we expected to sit in the Large Ghetto for a long time,” he continued.\nThe Nazis began disbanding the Large Ghetto on November 30, but to his dismay they ordered half of their troops into lines five abreast and marched them away from the ghetto and into the woods. The five-mile march ended in machine gun fire, as the Nazis killed over 14,000 of Riga’s Jews in a single day. \nThe families from the eastern side of the ghetto, including the Michelsons, were forced to bury the bodies. Shovel in hand, Michelson was tasked with piling the bodies – his classmates, friends and fellow Jews. In the midst of this torturous task, Michelson’s heart soon broke.\n“There was an infant girl – five months old. Fully and neatly dressed, no trauma, no blood, nothing. She was lying like a broken doll on one of the old graves. It really hit me at that time. Rationalization would do no good; we were all to be killed,” he said.\nNot too long after, the Nazis shut down the ghetto in Riga, fearing the Soviet Army approaching from the east. Michelson and the other Jewish prisoners were evacuated from Latvia and dispersed among Germany’s remaining concentration camps. Listed as a car mechanic when he was in the Large Ghetto, Michelson was placed into a slave-labor ammunition factory, working daily 12-hour shifts that alternated between day and night each week. \nOn April 11, 1945, the American army overtook a German city just south of the concentration camp where Michelson was held. When the camp’s SS abandoned their posts to escape to the north, Michelson and some others ran from the factory and took shelter in a nearby abandoned building. Overnight, the group made a fire and was caught the next morning by a German defense group, who, instead of returning them to the camp, led the Jews to the river where the U.S. was on the other side and set them free.\nBy the time of his liberation, Michelson had met nearly all of Riga’s Jewish community, whether it was from before the war, living with them in the ghettos and the camps or seeing their dead frozen faces.\n“All of my relatives who were in Riga at the time were murdered,” said Michelson.\nMichelson believes he survived against all odds so that he could serve as a living testament to the capability of humans. So that the memory of those who died will never be forgotten.\n “We are the last generation to hear directly from Holocaust survivors about their experiences,” said Leah Adelman ’17, President of the Jewish Student Union (JSU). “All of us [who went to the talk] can now be witnesses for future generations who will question how something this terrible was allowed to happen.”\nThe event, held last Friday, was sponsored by the JSU in commemoration of Yom HaShoah, known as Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n\n', 'Apr 24, 2015'), ('\nMembers of the Andover community will be able to unlock all dormitories and academic and administrative buildings with BlueCards, beginning Summer Session of this year. This change is meant to provide an additional level of security on campus, as the Office of Public Safety (OPP) will be able to regulate building permissions, including hours of access.\n“The [BlueCard] system will enhance [Andover]’s ability to secure buildings quickly in the event of an emergency, and BlueCard access can be immediately terminated and reissued if a BlueCard is lost or stolen,” wrote Maureen Ferris, Director of Risk Management, in an email to The Phillipian.\nCommunity members will have to simply wave their BlueCard over a card-reader to gain access to locked buildings. The reader, which scans a Radio-Frequency Identification chip embedded inside the card, determines the user’s identity and then grants access if the owner has the necessary clearance.\n“The main visible change will be that students will use [BlueCards] to access their dormitories instead of keys,” Ferris said. “Some academic and administrative buildings may also be locked to the public at prearranged times while still allowing students and employees access to those buildings by using their ID cards.”\nThe change comes after a successful trial period at Borden Gym, where the system has been utilized to permit students access to the locker rooms and staff members external access to the building after-hours. \nEven though the plan to integrate the system campus-wide next year will not be released until May, OPP equipped most dorms with card-readers over Spring Break.\nThe readers, which emit a soft bluish hue when they are not in use, will turn green if permission is granted and red if access is denied In the case of a power failure, the equipment will use its built-in battery back-up system, Ferris said.\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2015'), ('\nThe finalists for the annual Means Essay prize, Auguste White ’17, Samantha Lin ’16 and Jared Newman ’15, read their essays during All-School Meeting (ASM) this past Wednesday.

Attendees uploaded images of themselves holding written signs describing their best talents, an exercise meant to reduce the stigma associated with physical and mental disability by calling attention to people’s skills, regardless of ability.\nAfter Harbur’s talk, Wright described transitioning from a career in the theater industry to one in philanthropy, having discovered her passion during a trip to Serbia as part of the production cast for a movie about the Bosnian War.\nWright said during her presentation on Raising Change,“I will never forget the day when I got off the bus at Kragujevac… I was [treated] for ten minutes like Angelina Jolie… but after about ten feet people were spitting on me. To go from that [extreme] in such a short amount of time… really made me sensitive to who I was going be as an American doing international work.”\nIn addition to the keynote speakers, “Clutchella” featured three workshops, which were led by Rashid Gadansali ’03, Senior Associate of the Social Entrepreneurs’ Fund, Rohit Acharya ’04, Chief Data Scientist at First Access, Lawrence Bloom, Chairman of the Advisory Board of BeEnergy, and Randell Dauda and Patience Landford, Founder and Co-Founder of the Kporma O rganization for Liberian Girls’ Education, respectively.\nGadansali and Acharya held the workshops “Social Entrepreneurs’ Fund: Investing in Changemakers” and “First Access Markets Alternative Microlending Methods,” in which they spoke with students about social innovation and shared their experiences working together after graduating from Andover. \nThe two met when Gadansali’s company, Social Entrepreneurs’ Fund, an organization that funds early-stage, impact-focused companies, invested in Archarya’s company, First Access, which uses clients’ mobile and financial data to the credit risk of microloans.\n Gadansali during an interview with The Phillipian said, “I was really excited to find out about the Clutch Collaborative because, had it existed when I was here, I would have been very excited to participate in such [events]… it really does instill in you the value of Non Sibi.”\nAcharya said, “[I hope students leave with] an exposure to industry and [the realization] that it is not only just wanting to do something. It is also about actually doing it.”\nBloom dedicated his workshop, “Mindfulness and Environmentalism,” to discussing anxiety. After sharing his own journey to living a mindful and stress-free life, he invited participants to share their own anxieties and offered possible methods of resolution.\nHe said, “I think that many of the students here come from the sort of background where there’s a great expectation around achievement. Some of it may be spoken and some of it be unspoken but I thought it’d be a great idea to come and discuss what are their sources of anxiety, how it arises and to be honest and open about this.”\nThe “Kporma Liberian Girls Education Initiative” workshop, led by Dauda and Landford, focused on the increase of education access for girls in Liberia. After realizing the unfortunate situation of girls living in rural Liberia, the founders of Kporma began collecting clothing, shoes and feminine products. The program soon expanded to focus on education, taking note of their lack of access to school supplies and their parents’s inability to afford tuition, according to the Clutch Collaborative’s blog.\nThe annual Clutch Collaborative conference focuses on helping Andover students find ways to promote social change, which Rani Iyer ’15, Co-Chair of the Clutch Collaborative, defined as creating a difference that is impactful and visible within the community.\nAlex Westfall ’15, Co-Chair of the Clutch Collaborative, said, “We really tried to get a variety of different kinds of organizations… just to show that social change can be in so many different things and that it is not just limited to one, single definition.”\nIyer added, “We called it ‘Clutchella’ also because we wanted people to get excited about social entrepreneurship the same way that we get excited about music festivals.”\nThis year, the Clutch Collaborative will also be sending out packets to all the conference attendees, summarizing the main points of each presentation and workshop in hopes of propelling a change on campus.\nSerena Ren ’18, who attended the event, said, “The workshops really opened my eyes to the different types of social innovation and how businesses work.

He left no suicide note and had done no previous planning; it was an impulsive, spur-of-the-moment act that he thought would result in his death. Luckily, Burnham survived the nine-story fall and has since been heavily involved in campaigns for awareness of mental health.\nThis Wednesday in Cochran Chapel, Burnham spoke to Lowers about his depression and attempted suicide as a teenager during a presentation organized by Student Council in collaboration with Graham House. During his speech, Burnham noted that everyone has a connection to mental health, emphasizing the importance of discussing depression and other mental health issues openly.\nKelly Sheng ’17, who attended the presentation, said, “There is often a stigma that surrounds mental illness that we often do not address. I think that this presentation helped a lot of students understand both what it’s like to be a survivor of suicide as well as how present mental illness is.”\nBurnham recalled how his sister provided an outlet for him to express his feelings freely when he was bullied in school for the way he talked and dressed.\nBurnham said, “When I got home at the end of the day, I talked to my sister, and she was going through the same type of problems, the same type of issues. So when I got home after school, it was like my sister became my therapist and I became hers. She could relate to everything that was going for me, and vice versa.”\nBut when Burnham transferred to a new school for the second time, his sister was in college. Without his informal therapist, Burnham said that he coped with the challenges he faced by playing sports, making jokes and meeting new people. He also began drinking when he entered high school. \n“I didn’t drink just to black out, getting wasted for no reason. I drank because that was the one time me and my guy friends could talk about something real, other than girls or sports,” said Burnham.\nAs the years went on, Burnham could not cope with all the emotions he was feeling. When he failed his driver’s license test for the first time, he snapped, he said.\n“At this point, my feelings were like a rubber band, where I could pull back and extend for a really long period of time, pulling in any negative emotions or thoughts. But when I let go, I snap,” said Burnham.\nAfter that incident, his parents brought Burnham to see a therapist who officially diagnosed him with depression.\n“I had a very pessimistic way of viewing the world once I was diagnosed with depression. I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want to be judged, and I didn’t take it seriously. I was prescribed medication, but I wouldn’t take it on a consistent basis. I would lie to my therapist to get out of my sessions as quick as possible, and I was still using alcohol as an outlet to talk about my feelings and whatever I was going through,” said Burnham.\nDuring his junior year of high school, Burnham went to a mental hospital for a week, which he said helped him evaluate and nurture his mental health. When he returned to the stress and drama of school, however, he realized that nothing had changed, and, once again, he had no one to talk to about his struggles. \nOn the night of his suicide attempt during his senior year, Burnham had just returned from a golf tournament. That tournament was one of the best he’d ever played, and he was elated to tell his father. Upon returning home, however, his parents confronted him with the stash of alcohol Burnham kept hidden in his car trunk.\n“That was it for me in my mind. Here I am, [their] son, and all I do is disappoint them, make them angry or upset. I could tell from the expression on their faces [that] they [didn’t] even want me to be their son anymore. [I thought,] ‘What’s the point of being here if I can’t make the people that mean the most to me happy?’” said Burnham.\nTo this day, Burnham cannot remember the nine-story fall he endured that night. All he can recall are the events leading up to it and waking up in the hospital, trying to piece together what had happened. Later, when a reporter asked to interview Burnham and write about his story, Burnham immediately agreed.\n“I figured that [by writing my story], whoever reads this article, whoever hears about this story, is never in the position that I’m at right now laying in this hospital bed,” said Burnham.\n“[What] I really hope that everyone came away with [from the presentation]… is how their mental health affects certain things and if they have that conversation with others, they can realize how many other people can relate to it,” he continued. \nBurnham’s presentation was mandatory for all Lowers, as it was scheduled for their Wellness Week program but was cancelled due to bad weather. \nSithya Lach ’17 said, “When I first heard that we had to attend the program, I didn’t expect to hear from someone who had actually gone through an attempted suicide and someone who still struggles with depression. By including his own personal stories, Burnham created a personal connection with the audience which I really enjoyed.”\nBurnham is a professional public speaker on the topic of mental health. He has been sharing his story for the past six years and has appeared in a variety of magazines and TV programs. In 2008 he was invited to speak at a Congressional Briefing on Capitol Hill, and in 2010 Burnham was chosen as one of the best of Philadelphia for his work in mental health and public speaking.

Ultimately, Arya placed 11th overall of 150 participants in the event, titled “Impromptu Speaking.”\n“I was definitely nervous during the competition. I had never done a speech event before, only debates. So it was unnerving at first, but when I got past that initial nervousness, and when I got into the form and rhythm of the speech, it was really enjoyable and went by quickly,” he said.\nThe competition’s 150 participants competed in four categories over the course of the week-long tournament: Persuasive Speech, Interpretive Reading, Impromptu Speaking and Debating. \nThe event that ran from April 5 to April 12 attracted high school students from around the world, with 14 delegates representing the United States. Many of the American delegates were students from New England preparatory schools, Arya said. Countries from Europe, Asia and Australia were also represented at the WIDPSC.\n“The experience was incredibly valuable. First, due to the fact that it was an international competition, I was able to meet people from all around the world, people I would not have met otherwise. We were all competing against each other, but at the end of the competition we got to explore Hong Kong together,” said Arya.\nArya qualified for the WIDPSC by winning top prizes at debate tournaments throughout the year, including events at Roxbury Latin, Exeter, Hotchkiss and Andover. Some of his former competitors were also present at the competition.\n“The atmosphere was an odd mixture of competition and friendliness… I had seen [them] at different debates but hardly knew each other outside of a single debate round,” he said. \nAt Andover, Arya was a board member of the Philomathean Society and Mock Trial, and has been a regular attendee of Model United Nations since his first year here as a new Lower.\n“The Philomathean Society only does debate… so a majority of the tournament was completely uncharted waters for me, but I got to refine my skills [during the tournament] and I couldn’t have asked for a better [way] to be introduced to speaking events,” Arya said. \n“As far as public speaking, it helps me understand how to express my opinions and address a big crowd.

Soon after, students began to move about the room and read others’ responses, writing check marks on the ones that resonated with them.\nUpon entering embRACE, participants were assigned to discussion groups. The groups, each headed by two student facilitators, offered a chance for every voice to enter the conversation. \n“[Our group] talked about our personal experiences based on where we come from and what we’ve seen within our own friend-group dynamic, here at [Andover],” said Janet Conklin ’17 in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“If race is a fluid construct – some might say a social construct––we have to remember that racism isn’t,” Adrian Khactu, Instructor in English, added. “We think of racism as interpersonal racism, that doesn’t happen so much here in our small New England enclave. But we don’t realize is that there are many other types of racism: systemic racism, institutional racism. We need only look at the fact that the wealth gap by race, here in 2015 in the United States, is actually larger than in South Africa during the time of Apartheid.”\nAudience members ended the night by applauding Out of the Blue’s initiative and the guidance of Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of the Office of Community and Multicultural Development, in organizing the forum. The facilitators encouraged students and faculty members interested in keeping the conversation alive to get involved in spreading discussion throughout campus.\nCam Mesinger ’16 said, “I think that this [forum] was really well-advertised, but these kind of conversations can’t really die down. Especially [because] Ferguson was last summer… trying to just keep the discussion going after the media stops covering it, after people stop being ‘interested’ is really important.”\n Disla added, “The closing remarks, in which [the facilitators] asked students who wanted to continue the conversation to sign up for an email list, was an open invitation for those who are seeking some next steps in this kind of work. For some people, this was the start of a long journey toward understanding the impacts of race and we want to emphasize that the Andover community is willing to do something with them.”\n*Editors Note: Alessa Cross is a Commentary Editor for* The Phillipian, *Vol. CXXXVIII.*\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nAs an undergraduate at Yale University, Ming Tsai ’82, P ’18 made the life-changing decision to pursue a career as a chef by writing “I don’t care” on his mechanical engineering final exam.\n“This was my epiphany – everyone was punching away at their calculators and I wrote ‘I don’t care’ [on my exam sheet], because all I cared about was food,” said Tsai, a celebrity chef, restaurateur and television personality, during a presentation he gave on Saturday night in Kemper Auditorium.\nIn an interview with The Phillipian, Tsai said, “I [started cooking] when I was ten years old. I made my first fried rice, and I made people happy through food and thought, ‘Wow, this is cool.’ My first [inspirations] were my parents and grandparents: they cooked all the time, and I was blessed to always be around great-tasting food.”\nUpon his graduation from Yale, he proceeded to cook under various famous mentors, including sushi master Takashi Kobayashi and pastry chef Pierre Hermé. Tsai learned more cooking skills during summer sessions at Le Cordon Bleu, a renowned culinary school in France. He eventually also earned a master’s degree in hotel management from Cornell University.\nHoping to combine Eastern and Western cuisine styles into unique Asian-fusion dishes, Tsai opened his first restaurant, Blue Ginger, in Wellesley, Mass., in 1998. \nTsai emphasized the importance of preserving the traditional flavor of foods while blending in new tastes when creating fusion food.\n“People make these vinaigrettes [with such bold flavors] and say ‘Ah! It’s fusion!’… That’s not fusion, that’s confusion, because they never learned the traditional use,” said Tsai in a Q&A after his presentation. \nBlue Ginger received “Boston Magazine”’s 2008 Best of Boston Award. Tsai also owns Blue Dragon, another critically-acclaimed restaurant in Boston. \nTsai has appeared on various cooking television shows, including “East Meets West,” “Iron Chef America,” “Zoom” and his own show, “Simply Ming,” and has authored four cookbooks.\nKailash Sundaram ’15, who attended the presentation, said, “I’m very interested in [Tsai’s] story and what he has to offer and understanding the wide aspects of Asian culture. I think too often people mistake Asia as one single region, and this competition allowed us to see the different styles of Asian cooking that [show] that Asia is not one continent, but a wide variety of cultures.”\nAfter Tsai’s presentation, 12 student teams competed in Andover’s first-ever “Iron Chef” competition. Each pair was given a budget of $30 to create the best dish.\nThe competition was judged by Tsai, Head of School John Palfrey and audience member Wei Han Lim ’15. \nAt the end of the competition, the “Flaming Pterodactyls,” which included AJ Augustin ’15 and Hanover Vale ’15, were crowned as champions. The pair won a set of ceramic bladed knives.\n“We made ramen arepas topped with an avocado creme and pulled, slow-roasted, chipotle, five-spice chicken thighs in a sweet mango tamarind glaze and finished with a red cabbage, green mango and apple slaw,” wrote Augustin in an email to The Phillipian. “The best part was either making the food or winning and getting such high praise. It meant a lot that everyone enjoyed our food.”\nStudents were required to incorporate two ingredients, ramen noodles and chicken, into their dishes. Recipes came from around the world, with dishes ranging from a “Ramen Burger” to a ramen pizza with edamame and chicken.\nSydney Alepa ’15, who made the “Ramen Burger” with her partner, Eden Livingston ’15, said, “It was really exhilarating to be part of the competition. We wanted to do something that wasn’t traditional, so we thought it would be creative to do a fusion of American and Asian foods.”\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nAfter pressing play on her “Electric Feel” Pandora station, Catherine Kemp, Instructor in Biology, takes a boat out on the water and begins her workout, practicing technique drills to increase her range of motion. After rowing, she takes a nap with her dog, Wootles.\nFor Kemp, who joined Andover’s faculty this past fall and teaches Biology 100 and Biology 580, coaches Girls Crew and is a House Counselor in Alumni House, both coaching and rowing crew have been important aspects of her life since she started rowing in 1995.\n“I’ve loved every place I’ve rowed for… unique [reasons]. In Sacramento, we rowed past a bakery that made cookies at 5 a.m., and the scent drifting across the water as we rowed in the darkness was magical… Here [in] Andover, the water is the flattest I’ve ever seen, which is great for rowing,” wrote Kemp in an email to The Phillipian.\nShe takes the boat out on the water and begins her workout, practicing technique drills to increase her range of motion. Kemp’s love for rowing has stemmed from various motivations over the years. \n“When I was younger, I was externally driven by competition against others, and I had a huge chip on my shoulder. It was so satisfying to put in work and see myself accomplishing things I’d never thought I could do,” she said.\nAlthough her involvement with crew has shifted toward being an official and a coach, Kemp says that the sport remains a strong positive force for her.\n“Currently, [crew] is a mixture of social community through my alumni work and officiating and this comforting athletic fallback whenever I just need something that makes me feel competent,” said Kemp. “In coaching, my happiness is when my athletes find satisfaction, which is unique for each person. It’s about figuring out what the individual needs to meet her goals and improve.”\nKemp’s experience with rowing crew, however, has not always been easy.\n“[Before college,] I’d rowed a few months at an established club then my family moved, and my new school didn’t have crew until my junior year… We started with one manky old boat and a coach standing on shore, no docks, no boathouse, nothing like that! In the summers, I used an abandoned boathouse and taught myself to row a single. I was really passionate about the sport but hadn’t had access to tons of resources,” she said.\nIt was not until her time in college at Dartmouth, which she attended from 1998 to 2002, that Kemp was able to fully pursue crew.\n “The chance to focus on it full-time – although I wasn’t recruited, things worked out pretty well,” she continued.\nIn addition to allowing her to embrace rowing completely, Kemp’s years at Dartmouth were also impactful academically and intellectually. \nKemp initially thought she would major in Chinese because she felt discouraged from sciences in high school. She became disillusioned with the life of a business worker after working as a receptionist at a airplane tire retread factory following her freshman year.\n“All I could envision was some life where I’d have to wear panty hose every day to work in a business environment,” she said. Since this idea was unappealing to her, Kemp decided she needed to try something new.\nDespite her experiences with science in high school, Kemp decided to give the subject another try. “I told myself I could take one science class, and if it went well I would switch majors,” she said.\nFlipping through her college course catalogue, she found an interesting option – ecology classes, where she discovered that she would spend her time not working at a desk, but chasing frogs outside at midnight.\nAfter exploring ecology a little more, Kemp eventually graduated from Dartmouth with an A.B. in Environmental and Evolutionary Biology. After that, she proceeded to earn her Ph.D. in Genetics from the University of California-Davis.\nAt Andover, Kemp’s role as a coach and instructor has allowed her to combine her two passions of crew and biology. In addition to coaching, teaching and serving as a house counselor, Kemp enjoys spending time with her family, running and baking. \n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nAfter months of competition, Andover’s Mock Trial Club was named the regional Champion of the 2015 Massachusetts Bar Association tournament at the end of Winter Term.\nThe tournament, held in the Lawrence District Courthouse, consisted of 140 teams from both public and private schools across Massachusetts competing against each other in an authentic courtroom setting with professional judges, said Kory Stuer ’15, Former Co-President of Andover Mock Trial. The new Co-Presidents are Claire Park ’16 and Lindsay Tausch ’16.\nStuer credited the club members’ thorough preparation for their win.\n“I can say confidently that what made the difference was… putting in the sheer amount of time and getting the hang of the difficult mechanics of [Mock Trial] early on so that when we got to the higher levels of competition, we could really engage more meaningfully with the logic and performance of [Mock Trial],” said Stuer.\nThe club began preparing for the tournament in November. Preparation for the tournament was focused on memorization and professionalism.\n“We had approximately two meetings each week. In one of those meetings, it might be a smaller, team-based meeting… that might take 45 minutes. And the other meeting would usually be on a Sunday morning, and we would meet and do a run through, a practice round, of a trial. It would be a way of making sure that we were prepared, that we could be thinking in trial mindset,” said Stuer.\nAlison Nunes ’17 said, “We were just really prepared. We had really good leadership from our Senior Board. They made sure that we had everything memorized, that we knew all the rules, so that when it came to the trial, it was the little details that we really payed attention to as a group, and a lot of the other teams are missing that.”\nSeveral tournament dates in January were postponed due to heavy snowfall, which lead to Andover attending three trials in one week during the tournament. The strange schedule was one of the biggest challenges for club members.\nEach year, the tournament focuses on one specific case. Stuer said legal professionals from Massachusetts used real-life laws as a basis for writing the case, but used fictional characters and crimes.\nStuer said, “For this year, the case was a charge of murder against a 71-year-old grandparent accused of murdering an abusive son-in-law. The prosecution called it cold blooded murder, but the defense contended that it was self-defense.”\nNunes described the final trial against Chelmsford High School, her first time in the courtroom.\nShe said, “It felt like there were 50 people from the opposing team there, filling the balconies, and it really felt like a real trial, which was scary, but a lot of fun, too. I had to learn a new part, so in total, I learned three different parts as a witness. We only had six people who were able to make it, so we had to fill in. Everyone had to change up their roles a little bit.”\nAntonia Leggett ’15, Former Co-Head of Mock Trial, participated in mock trial while in middle school and joined Andover’s Mock Trial club as a Junior, seeing the club as an opportunity for experience in both leadership and competition.\nLeggett said, “For me, something that was especially rewarding was seeing the transition of soxme of the new members of the team, and seeing how far they were willing to come, and how much they helped the team in the end. I was very proud of all the work that I had done in organizing them, and the work that everyone on the team had done.”\nAlthough Stuer inadvertently got involved with Mock Trial after being signed up for the club by a friend his Lower year, he now enjoys both the public speaking and legal aspects of the club itself.\nStuer said, “I really have had such a good time exploring not only the real life legal elements to it, because you are using real life cases and citing the Massachusetts general laws in the circumstance, but also being able to truly explore the performance aspect and the public speaking and your debate skills.”\nStuer also said that he particularly enjoys the fact that although Mock Trial features fictional cases, it feels realistic.\n“One of the coolest things about Mock Trial is when you are performing in a real courtroom [and] in front of a real judge, you forget for a moment that you are a high schooler with a fictional case. For a moment, you are a real attorney, a real witness, using the real legal elements to prove a real case, and that is fantastic,” said Stuer.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nSince she was seven years old, Esha Bansal ’15 and her brother played the violin every day for their grandmother, who was diagnosed with cancer. Although they had just begun to learn, they discovered that even the simplest music could make their grandmother’s day. This realization inspired Bansal and her older brother, now a sophomore in college, to continue playing the violin.\nBansal and her brother are the founders of MusicMDs. According to their website, “MusicMDs is a music-therapy-inspired outreach organization of high-school and college musicians who volunteer their music to promote patient healing in hospitals.” Founded in 2009, the organization now operates in Massachusetts, Texas and Florida, Bansal’s home state. Eight Andover students are involved in the program.\n“We researched a connection between music and health, and we learned about music therapy, and that led us to start trying to provide the service to people in hospitals throughout our community because it’s a very fast-tracking field, and it has a lot of clinical benefits, but it hasn’t been widely implemented,” said Bansal in an interview with The Phillipian.\nBansal and her brother first began performing in nursing homes, where they devised a model for their visits. They realized that music was the icebreaker, because it made people feel relaxed and willing to open up to them. After developing this model, they brought their proposal to their local hospital.\n“We presented [the proposal] to some members of the management there, and we started it on a trial basis with me and my brother. It was well-received, so we started to recruit other students. We developed a protocol so it would be easier to train [students], and then as the organization came to grow, there became policies, a system for scheduling attendance and all those things,” said Bansal.\nMusicMDs is not the only manifestation of Bansal’s interest in public health. Bansal said that during Winter Term, she did an Independent Project about the “latino health paradox” and “health inequities that face the Spanish-speaking, bilingual and bicultural population,” using the city of Lawrence as a case study.\nBansal first discovered the issue of the “latino health paradox” during a Spanish immersion course in Lawrence taught by Mark Cutler, Instructor in Spanish. At the time, she had already established the MusicMDs program at the Lawrence General Hospital and was actively performing. In putting the two experiences together, she realized the prevalence of communication challenges in the community.\n“The immersion class was more focused on Lawrence High School and students and telling people’s stories about the immigrant experience, and that really clicked with me when I saw patients in the hospital who had similar stories but were dealing with the emotional, psychological and physical issues of hospitalization. I think it was those kids that we worked with at Lawrence High Schools, the teachers and the interviewees in that project that I saw reflected in the patients, and I realized that these people needed their stories told as well,” said Bansal.\nThe “latino paradox,” Bansal explained, is the gradual decrease in the overall health of a Hispanic community over multiple generations. The phenomenon has been discovered and documented before, but never clinically researched, a fact Bansal attributes to the ideology of white supremacy in the political climate of the United States.\n“As these Latino immigrants arrive in the United States, they actually fare better than the average white American in most statistical health indicators. But as the generations pass, they become more prone to health challenges in relation to the white population… [the Latino paradox] has been ignored in clinical research for a few reasons, one of which is white superiority and anti-immigrant political tendencies that have swayed funding away from it,” said Bansal.\nOver the course of the term, Bansal interviewed various members of the Lawrence community, including hospital employees, social workers, health-related non-profit leaders, recent immigrants and the coordinator for the mayor’s health task force. She also researched clinical studies on Latino-American health issues and compiled all of her work into a 17-minute documentary at the end of the term.\n“I’ve been working more with the [Lawrence] Mayor’s task force and the city government to use this [documentary] as a way to address mental health in public schools nearby, do [continuous] education in health centers and for medical personnel… also, I live in Florida, which is another huge state for Latinos – I want to make a part two,” said Bansal.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nOpening the audience’s eyes to the dehumanizing practices of child marriages in Turkey, Cem Vardar ’15 gave a BRACE presentation last Friday hoping to raise awareness for and educate students about the harsh reality that is the life of many Turkish girls. \nIn his presentation, Vardar defined child marriage as an official marriage or unofficial union in which at least one of the spouses are under 18 years old. He stated that 217,000 Turkish girls between the ages of 15 and 18 were married, with the regions of highest rate of child marriage being the poorest, most underdeveloped and most patriarchal communities in Turkey. \n“The dehumanizing practices of child marriages is reflective of the deep wounds resting in the social fabric of Turkish society,” Vardar said. \nVardar identified economic pressure as a contributing factor to the profileration of underaged marriage in Turkey, drawing a correlation between education and vulnerability to child marriage. \n“The percent of underage girls who married illiterate is 47.2%. The more educated the girls are, the less vulnerable they become to child marriages. Girls from poor families are twice as likely to become victims of this practice,” he said.\nIn addition, Vardar said that families avoid the possible cost of raising their girls by arranging their marriages to men in exchange for bride prices, which he said were often inversely proportional to the age of the female spouse. \nAs a result of this practice, Vardar said that families placed their own daughters in positions in which they were deprived of their economic independence, personal agency, educational potential and most importantly, their childhood. He also mentioned that the discrepancies in the Turkish judicial system regarding child marriages allowed families to keep the practice alive. \nQuoting popular colloquial phrases such as “when girls are in the cradle their [bride price] should be ready,” Vardar demonstrated how deeply integrated child marriages are in Turkish society. \nVardar said that the foremost consequence of child marriages was that it feminized poverty by depriving girls of their future opportunities and economic independence. Similarly, he said that they curtailed future job opportunities for girls and perpetuated a cycle of poverty. \nVardar underscored the damaging effects child marriage has on girls’ sexuality. \n“The limitations imposed on girls’ sexual self-expression serve to deplete the dynamism of the sexuality by placing [it] within a rigid mold. Deprived of their sexual dynamism, girls can’t investigate or discover their sexual identities,” he said. \n“This practice symbolically kills girls and turns their bodies into inert and proprietary instruments… the practice of child marriage is hurting not just Turkey but the entire humanity as a whole,” said Vardar.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nDeborah Burdett Murphy ’86, Director of Alumni Engagement, will be departing Andover for the coming 2015-2016 school year to become the Assistant Head for Engagement and Advancement at the Nashoba Brooks School, a day school in Concord, Mass.\nMurphy’s work as Assistant Head for Engagement and Advancement at Nashoba Brooks will draw on her experiences from her 24 years at Andover, during which she has served as an acting Dean of Admissions, a Girls Tennis coach, a house counselor and an advisor, in addition to her current role as Director of Alumni Engagement. \n“This new position [at the Nashoba Brooks School] has oversight of admissions, communications, alumni and development… I was really intrigued by the possibility of bringing all of my experiences from admissions and my alumni development communications work into one job and being able to really bring those experiences and talents to a new place,” said Murphy in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe various roles Murphy has held at Andover will help her transition well to her new job, especially as Nashoba Brooks, which is co-ed from preschool to third grade and all-girls from fourth grade to eighth grade, looks towards its future through its new strategic plan. \n“Within their [recent] strategic plan, [the Nashoba Brooks School] has several goals… one of them is to broaden outreach and continue diversifying their student body… That part really appealed to me in terms of my previous admissions experience. On a broader scale… they want to increase engagement with parents and alumni… to continue to raise money…and as the school now grows into a better, bigger place, they are putting this structure in place with a new advancement team… and [my] position will oversee that team,” said Murphy.\nAs Assistant Head for Engagement and Advancement, Murphy will handle data and craft strategies to improve the admission and alumni connections. She hopes to be able to analyze situations in order to apply creative solutions to these problems. \n“There is definitely a lot of responsibility, but I also am excited by the opportunity for a lot of growth. It seems like and feels like, from everyone I have talked to, that it is this great, little school that everyone loves, enjoys and is excited about, and it is on the verge of becoming even greater,” she added.\nMurphy will continue to live on campus with her husband, Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life and Instructor in Mathematics, and her children.\n“Something that makes this really nice for me is that I will still be living on [Andover’s] campus… I will be driving about 40 minutes to school everyday, but I don’t have to say goodbye to everyone… As an [alumna], I will still go to my reunions, and… my son will be coming [to Andover] in the fall and my daughter is an Upper… so I will be a parent [at Andover] as well,” she said.\nEven as Murphy looks forward to her new job at Nashoba Brooks, she said she has loved working with students, parents and alumni during her time at Andover.\n“The best thing about [Andover] is the people. That definitely starts with the students, and when I was in [the Admissions Office], I used to interview kids, travel and meet kids in eighth grade in their little schools. I loved all of that because I loved connecting good people to a good place,” she said.\nMurphy added that she would especially like to thank Jane Foley Fried, former Dean of Admissions and current Head of the Brearley School, an all-girls school in New York, NY., who began working at Andover on the same day in July 1991 as Murphy.\n“I am incredibly grateful for all of the experiences I have had here. [Fried] was always this amazing friend and mentor, and she is now doing great things. I learned a ton in the Admissions Office. I got to work in the Alumni and Development Office and learned from great people there. So I’ve been fortunate to have amazing colleagues and opportunities… I would say she was a really important person for me,” said Murphy.\nJennifer Savino, Associate Director of Alumni Engagement, Regional Events and Special Programs, will serve as the acting Director of the Alumni Engagement for 2015-2016.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2015'), ('\nThe Andover community has been granted free access to the digital subscription of “The New York Times” (“The Times”) through a recent deal between the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) and “The Times.” \n“Over the past few years, people have at various times asked us if they can get access to [‘The Times’]. A couple years ago, I went to a library conference, and they were talking about the institutional access program, and I was very interested in that, because I thought it would be important for this community,” Elisabeth Tully, Director of the OWHL, said.\nOriginally, the school-wide subscription was deemed too expensive by the OWHL, but “The Times” recently contacted Tully to inform her of their price drop from $14,000 to $6,000 a year. In addition, “The Times” also adjusted their access availability, allowing all members of the Andover community to use the program regardless of their location, rather than excluding day students and adults who live off campus. \n “[‘The Times’] was prohibitively expensive and [did not allow access] to what we wanted. As time has gone by, however, ‘The Times’ has realized they were pricing themselves out of the market, and they needed to hit a price point that people could actually support,” Tully said.\n In order to determine the initial support for the program, Tully posted a survey towards the end of February on Blackboard and the OWHL website. Users were asked whether they were currently subscribed to “The Times,” if they were not subscribed but would like to if it were free or if they were not interested in the program. Out of the hundreds of faculty members and students who took the survey, the majority answered that they are interested in having the digital subscription.\n“We were pretty confident that people would be interested in this, but one of the reasons you do a survey is to make people aware that you are thinking about this [program]. We were really overwhelmed by how quickly people said, ‘I would definitely use this,’ so it was kind of a no-brainer,” Tully said.\n Despite its subscription to “The Times,” the OWHL still remains cognizant of the merits of providing a broad range of news sources to campus. \n“Spending this [amount] of money on ‘The New York Times,’ which is acknowledged as an excellent newspaper yet considered to be disproportionately representative of one range of opinions, is hard for us to do. If we were able to, we would [set up a similar program] for ‘The Wall Street Journal’ or another newspaper considered to be on the other side of the spectrum,” Tully said.\n A user must be on campus in order to be authenticated to set up an account.

It’s a lot of running and screaming at the same time,” Shipley wrote in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe new spirit leaders performed cheer after cheer, involving the crowd and keeping the energy unusually high for a Tuesday night.\n “Blue Key Heads are the faces of positivity, happiness and cheer at Andover. I want to be someone that people look to if they’re having a bad day or just want to laugh, ” said Bergeron.\n Some of new Blue Key Heads also shared stories of their own experiences with the BKH XIII their Junior years. \n“I wanted to be a Blue Key Head because during orientation I was just a scared little [Junior]. The Blue Key Heads were the first people I met, and they really welcomed me into the Andover experience,” Ira said. \n “The Blue Key Heads were my role models on campus, and if I can inspire someone else to break out of their shell then I will feel accomplished,” McCarthy wrote in an email to The Phillipian. \nBKH XVI also took moments to reflect on the audition process amidst the chaos and excitement of Tuesday night. “The best part of my audition was looking around [Paresky Commons] and seeing my friends there. Every single person in that room wanted me to do well, and that made me scream just a little bit louder,” said McCarthy.\n Several members of BKH XVI pointed to their serenades as the highlight of the audition. This year, applicants serenaded the entire crowd, rather than just one individual.\n“The best part of my audition was having the chance to sing Madonna in Lower Right. That chance doesn’t come around often, but when it does, you have to be ready,” wrote Jancsy in an email to The Phillipian. \nTrautmann said, “My favorite part [of my audition] was dancing in front of a large crowd, because I got to show off the moves that I’ve been practicing my whole life.”\n Despite the excitement, the auditions were also intimidating experiences to many, as they took place in the crowded Lower Right of Paresky. “The scariest part of the audition was entering and screaming, and trying to get everyone into it,” said Chavez.\n The interview portion was also quite daunting, where BKH XV asked questions pertaining to Andover spirit and Blue Key Head duties. “They kept on asking me about gorillas, like ‘how many species of gorillas are there in Africa?’ and honestly, I had no idea,” said Ira.\n BKH XVI also shared anxieties about the coming year as spirit leaders at Andover, and continuing the long traditions of Blue Key Heads. “I am nervous about living up to the awesome Blue Key Heads that came before us. Each skirt has its own lineage, so there are faces to those who wore it before you, ” said McCarthy.\n The traditional skirts of the Blue Key heads also provided a great amount of excitement. “I wanted to be a Blue Key Head because I get to wear a skirt every Friday, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do my whole life,” said Trautmann. \n Bergeron, Chavez, Shipley and Trautmann chose “What do we eat? Red meat!” as their favorite cheers, while Jancsy and McCarthy chose “Let’s get a little bit rowdy!” and Ira, Redding and Welch chose “When I say blue, you say white.”\n “You can’t go wrong with getting the crowd a lil’ rowdy,” said Jancsy. \n*Bergeron and Redding are Sports and Cartoon Editors, respectively, for* The Phillipian, *Vol. CXXXVIII.*\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nAlexis Lefft ’16 and Akhil Rajan ’17 were recently named the first two student members of the Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers (IRT) Advisory Board.\n“[Lefft] and [Rajan] were chosen from a pool of 18 current students, all of whom were very impressive contenders. Ultimately, we were taken by the ways in which [Lefft] and [Rajan]’s life stories, interests and passions intersect with the mission of the IRT,” Julia Johannsen, IRT Advisory Board Chair, wrote in an email to The Phillipian. \nPaul Murphy, Dean of Students, sent an email to the Lower and Upper classes encouraging students to submit an application for the board earlier this year. \nThe IRT Advisory Board helps fundraise and strategize for the IRT, which works to recruit college students of color committed to diversity in education, advising and counseling them throughout their pursuit of careers in education. The board meets twice a year, once in January and once in July.\nLefft, who lives in Lake Wylie, S.C., a predominantly white town, believes strongly in the importance of fostering a diverse teaching faculty.\nLefft said, “When I came here, I started thinking about diversity and what it means a lot more. Where I’m from, everyone was pretty much the same. I think a whole new set of issues are on the table when you’re in a diverse community.”\n“For some people, it’s really important to have teachers that look like them,” she continued. “I think it makes people feel welcome in the broadest sense.”\nLefft looks forward to increasing knowledge of the IRT at Andover, where discussions on the value of diversity are common, she said. \nBoth Lefft and Rajan were exposed to the importance of education at an early age by family members with careers in education. \nRajan said, “Both my parents are educators, and I’m Indian-American, so I’ve seen a lot of other places where education is not how it is here; [I’ve seen where education is] not a right, but rather a privilege. That’s how I’ve always known there’s a special importance to education.”\nThe IRT works to increase the diversity of faculty in institutions of higher education, a cause that interests Rajan.\n“Even in places like Andover, which is supposed to be this shining beacon of diversity, we have great and encouraging numbers in the student body, but in the faculty, we don’t see the same results. And that’s something that’s very troubling to me, personally,” he continued. \nThe IRT Advisory Board has been thinking of inviting Andover students to participate for years, but the 2014-2015 school year is the first in which students have been encouraged to submit applications. Johannsen hopes that having students on the board will increase IRT visibility on campus and with alumni, as well as serving as an opportunity for student members to learn what goes into running such an organization.\nJohannsen said, “We will be able to teach [Rajan] and [Lefft] and all future [Andover] student board members about the importance of good governance and fundraising practices, the importance of philanthropy in general and the opportunities and challenges of making an impact through non-profit programs and volunteer work as board members.”\nRajan hopes to increase interest in the organization on campus as well and is excited by the prospect of contributing his perspective as a student with no professional experience to Advisory Board discussions. \nJohannsen, too, is eager to see how Lefft and Rajan will strengthen the board.\nJohannsen said, “As [Lefft] and [Rajan] bring the unique perspective of current [Andover] students, we would like them to find their voices at the table, to participate fully as voting board members and also to serve as ambassadors of [the] IRT on the [Andover] campus and elsewhere.” \n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nIn light of a complaint raised by a student who recently was invited to a campus secret society, Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, reminded students and faculty that secret societies were not allowed at Andover, in an email sent last Friday. \n This is not the first instance that a secret society’s presence has been discovered on campus. A rule forbidding secret societies was added to the Blue Book a few years ago in the wake of a student’s allegation that there had been something hurtful about the selection process for a secret society she had been invited into.\nThe Blue Book says: “given our diversity and the value we place on inclusivity and fairness amongst all members of our community, exclusive or secret societies are not permitted.”\n Murphy said that before the incident, most faculty members had dismissed secret societies as “benign.” With the growing emphasis, however, on hazing and bullying on school campuses, faculty became more aware of the possibility of hazing being prevalent at Andover, particularly in secret societies. The faculty-student dialogue would eventually lead to the addition of the rule to the Blue Book.\n“All of a sudden, someone sent up an anonymous list of all the kids in it. And we thought, ‘this seems like something we should talk to [students] about and tell them this doesn’t fit in the school,’ which then created an interesting conversation among some faculty and students,” Murphy said.\n The root of the problem, Murphy said, lies in the obscurity of the selection process. He differentiated secret societies from organizations on campus that require application by their accessibility to the student body.\n “Think about The Phillipian, it’s an open process, anyone can apply, it’s clear what the guidelines are. Having this all be quiet and behind the scenes start to feel like, isn’t this against what we’re trying to promote?” said Murphy. \n At the same time, however, Murphy said that he understood why students may gravitate toward joining a secret society, mentioning the sense of belonging to a group as one of the driving causes. “An argument could be made that having a secret group that makes people feel like they’re part of something bigger is an uplifting thing,” he said. \n “I can see the attraction for [secret societies], but I just think it takes a stronger person to say, ‘This might be good for me, but it’s not good for the community, and therefore, I’m not going to participate,” Murphy said. \n In the end, Murphy hopes that students will realize the problem with joining a secret society and take it upon themselves not to join. He urged students to uphold community values and think about their impact on the school.\n “Civil discourse, friendliness, ‘we’re all in this together,’ ‘this is our school’: those values have to be held up higher than ‘what’s in it for me.’ I think that’s something that most people need to have,” Murphy said.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nAs the College Counseling Office (CCO) grows and changes, it will be restructured into a model featuring both a dean and a director next year, with Sean Logan, current Director of CCO, assuming the role of Dean.

This year, over 300 prospective students, approximately 75 percent of admitted students, spent a day at Andover.\n James Ventre, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid, said, “[The Spring Visits have], over the years, become a very popular opportunity for admitted students… I’ll say [it] has to do with students and families really appreciating the culture of different schools and finding where their value structure is consistent to the school with which they’ve been admitted.”\n Approximately 50 percent of admitted students had officially enrolled in Andover prior to Spring Visits, said Ventre.\nThe night prior to the Spring Visits, the admitted students are invited to attend a cupcake social and talent show. The show features performances from all varieties of student talent ranging from a capella groups to “mathemagics’”.\n “It’s not an all polished up kind of talent show. It’s meant to be fun and engaging – to give families the sense that we [can have fun], while [being] very dedicated to providing all the substance around curriculum and residential life,” Ventre said.\nThe Spring Visits include participation in classes as well as various forums. The visits are designed to allow prospective students to gain a sense of the classes and daily life at Andover. \nIsabelle Bicks, a prospective Lower, said, “[I liked] sitting in on classes because, when I came to tour [earlier in the year, I had] more of an outside view. When you come back for the visit, you can see more in depth… When I got accepted, I was pretty sure that I was going to come, but [I visited] just to make sure – just to see the school one more time before I definitely said yes.” \nEach prospective student followed an Andover student host from second period to the end of sixth period. These Andover students hosts are currently enrolled in the grade in which the prospective student will enter in the fall.\n Carra Wu ’17 said, “I always like having a revisit and I apply every year, but I think one of the hard things is you can never predict what your day is going to be like that day. So you could have a test the next period that you really have to cram for or some kind of … class that’s not conducive to having revisits that day.”\n During conference period, the prospective students took a mini class without their hosts. These classes, ranging from trying different language classes to looking at the stars in the observatory, showed a wide variety of interesting activities and classes offered at Andover.\n Xander Schwartz, a prospective Junior, said, “[I] probably [want to try] the clubs and [see] how many different options there are and how many people can start things. I wouldn’t start anything my first year or two, but when I’m an Upper or a Senior, [I’ll take advantage of] the different options… You can create your own path [at Andover].”\n The night prior to the Spring Visits, the admitted students are invited to attend a cupcake social and talent show.

It’s meant to be fun and engaging – to give families the sense that we [can have fun], while [being] very dedicated to providing all the substance around curriculum and residential life,” Ventre said.\n In addition to the student program during Spring Revisits, a simultaneous parent program is included as well. Parents begin the day with a one-on-one question and answer section with Head of School John Palfrey. They then participate in a “mini-class” where the teachers discuss and display various methods of teaching students.\n “[These ‘mini-classes’ are] really fun because we want to give our faculty the chance to get some exposure to our parents, and [a program like this invites] a variety of different faculty from different disciplines to explore with parents the way they approach students in the classroom,” Ventre said.\n After the “mini-classes,” parents participate in a variety of forums and panels held by faculty and current students that focus on various aspects of Andover life and education.\n Natalie Wombwell, Assistant Dean of Admissions, said, “Parents get to experience a lot. It’s all about the living, the learning and …the student life and extracurriculars as well.”\n At the end of the day, parents and prospective students alike gather to listen to a forum regarding the performing and visual arts at Andover. After Spring Visits, still undecided admitted students are required to send in their decisions by April 10 at noon.\n “This is an important decision for families to make, and we are very clear in our ambition to provide them with a vision of their future that is authentic and genuine and real and I close every day by saying, ‘We are the Phillipians, we are the big blue and we are here for you.’ That’s my little message and people understand that… This is who we are – we’re not trying to be something that we’re not everyday in our lives here,” Ventre said.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nThe Tang Institute will host a Lunch & Discussion series each Friday and led by faculty on campus to showcase their work. These lunches will also feature collaborators, practitioners and other members of the Andover community who are working on “interesting projects,” according to the Institute’s post in the “Andover Gazette.”\nDuring each lunch, a faculty member, part of a group called the Tang Institute Fellows, will lead discussion on current Institute projects, focused on improving education at Andover.\nCaroline Nolan, Director of the Tang Institute, said that the lunch series was designed in the hopes of creating a space to foster conversations and exchange for upcoming projects.\n“We are in the first official year of the Institute, but from our founding day, the priority has been to host and feature community projects, innovative approaches to teaching and learning. The idea of having numerous opportunities and events to do that has been a part of the plan right from the beginning,” Nolan said.\nEric Roland, Precourt Director of Partnerships for the Tang Institute, said, “I think having conversations with a community as broad as possible is hopefully something that not only is beneficial to the project that the faculty is doing but also for all of us to continue to learn and think about new practices in the work we’re doing.”\nThe lunches, which are open to the public, including students and faculty, are part of a pilot plan for the Tang Institute, a startup that launched this past fall and is devoted to promoting innovative teaching and learning, according to the Institute’s website.\nNolan said, “I also hope that we’ll be able to feature some other initiatives around campus that want to be part of this conversation. There are people doing creative things everywhere around here and if we can tap into those things, into each of them, we’d love to do it.”\nThe first of the lunch series will be held on April 3 in Pearson Hall by Noah Rachlin, Instructor in History and Tang Institute Fellow, whose project is titled, “ ‘I Can’t Do That… Yet’ Cultivating Learning Dispositions.”\nRachlin said, “Our argument is that you need to have a certain disposition, you need to be prepared for the challenge and the struggles that come with learning and know how to handle that. What we’re trying to do is think critically about how we can structure what we do and what specific language we use that helps to cultivate that disposition when they’re here at Andover.”\nRachlin was put in contact with the Tang Institute when he first expressed his interest in improving teaching on campus. Through conversations, he was eventually connected to Caroline Nolan and made part of the current Fellow group of 2014-2015.\n“The thing that has been really valuable about the Institute is that it has provided a physical space and also provided a series of thought partners. It has provided a group of colleagues and adults who are really insightful and thoughtful and can help both support in a spirited way that cheers along this work and also in a way then lends a critical eye to think about what’s working, what could be better and what are the next steps,” Rachlin said.\n“This place is pretty big and sometimes there’s a lot of space between us. The geographic or physical space between academic buildings sometimes manifests itself in practical and cultural space and makes it hard for us to know what’s going on in other areas and to bridge gaps and come together in ways that are really constructive. Hopefully, the lunches are a small step towards addressing that,” he continued.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nWith ravenous fires consuming entire villages, daily executions on display for the public eye and countless rapes and murders, peace is a luxury that is difficult to come by in Rakhine State, Myanmar.\n Benjamin Zawacki, Fellow at Harvard Law School’s Human Rights Program and Term Member of the Council on Foreign Relations, spoke to students last Friday in Kemper Auditorium about the ongoing, egregious human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims in Southeast Asia.\n The presentation aimed to transport viewers 8,000 miles from their seats in Kemper to conflict-ridden cities, ultra-nationalistic mobs and inhospitable ghettos throughout the Rakhine State, a heavily-Buddhist region on the southwestern coast of Myanmar.\nZawacki said that although no nation is without its human rights challenges, those against the Rohingya are rising to the alarming level of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \n “Since mid-2012, Myanmar’s Rohingya have suffered a series of direct attacks by Rakhine civilians as well as Myanmar security forces, such that now over 140,000 are internally displaced in the country and many more have fled as refugees,” Zawacki wrote in an email to The Phillipian, describing the discrimination that the Rohingya are facing from the government today.\n Probing the rise of recent outbreaks of violence in the region, Zawacki’s presentation focused on the three central reasons why the Rohingya are victims of widespread violence. He listed nationality and discrimination, statelessness and discrimination as the primary causes.\n “[The Rohingya’s] homes, businesses and places of worship – as Muslims they are a religious minority as well – have been destroyed, and they have suffered a plethora of human rights violations,” Zawacki said. \n “This follows decades of systemic discrimination and persecution, which, in conjunction with the recent attacks, constitute ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,” he said.\n Zawacki, whose résumé includes stints at Amnesty International, The Elders and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that his passion for human rights sparked from his longstanding interest in social justice and humanitarian law after graduating from law school.\n The clash between ethnic Rakhines and the Rohingya dates back to World War II when a British-led arms deal intended to equip the Rohingya with means to defend then-Burma from an impending Japanese attack. Instead of acting as the British buffer, the Rohingya used the English weapons to pillage the ethnic Rakhines and destroy Buddhist monuments, temples and monasteries. \nThe 1982 Citizenship Law, serving as the turning point in Myanmar’s contentious Muslim-Buddhist relations, denied the Rohingya any recognition from the federal government as to the status of their citizenship. To this day, officials reject the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar, casting them off as stateless people, despite the fact their ancestors had inhabited the land for hundreds of years.\n Rakhine State, whose population is dominantly comprised of ethnic Rakhines, is now the home to an impromptu apartheid system that seeks vengeance for the Rohingya’s transgressions from over half a century ago. Many Rakhines have justified their systemic discrimination towards the Rohingya on grounds of past prejudices and mutual plights, according to Zawacki. \nThe societal climate of the Rakhine State, Zawacki noted, has rapidly evolved over the course of the Rohingya Crisis.\n As a testament to the transformation, Zawacki recalled one of his trips to Myanmar, on behalf of former President Jimmy Carter, in which a group of Buddhist monks orchestrated a protest on the streets outside of a Rohingya ghetto to demand for forcible deportment.\n“There is no single governing narrative on [Myanmar]; it is neither the brand new country nor the same old regime it is often portrayed as,” Zawacki said. \n“I hope that students came away with not only an appreciation of the truly dire situation of the Rohingya, but also with an understanding of the Responsibility to Protect and its applicability to that situation,” Zawacki continued.\nZawacki’s visit was sponsored by the Student Anti-Genocide Coalition (STAND). \n\n', 'Apr 3, 2015'), ('\nIn response to a large increase in the number of visits to Graham House in the past two years, the Empathy and Balance Subcommittee of the Strategic Plan is creating a new required curriculum for students to promote community wellness.\nThe new curriculum proposed by the faculty in February will include two different models for upperclassmen and lowerclassmen. Juniors and Lowers will take an altered version of the currently existing Personal and Community Education (PACE) class, said Carol Israel, Director of Graham House. Classes will be taught by Andover faculty members, who will receive training from Graham House counselors, and address topics such as stress management, time management, coping skills and mindfulness. As part of the proposal, Seniors will take weekly classes about the transition to college, and both Seniors and Uppers will be given the opportunity to gain leadership skills by leading the Junior and Lower classes. \n“The idea is that [students from] all four years will have much more time devoted to strengthening their coping skills, strengthening their empathy skills, helping people feel more confident [and] basically learn to treat people more decently. There will be a real curriculum for all four years that’s not just, ‘Sit in the classroom and read a book.’ It’ll be a variety of things,” said Israel. \nSo far this year, 318 students have visited Graham House, and the number will likely exceed 400 by the end of the year, according to Israel. In the 2013-2014 school year, 379 students visited Graham House, and in the three years prior to that, the number of students did not exceed 300.\n“I really think that kids in general aren’t as resilient these days when they hit roadblocks, when they face failure, when they have a crisis. I think we adults haven’t been as good at helping our children develop really good coping skills, and sometimes I think we protect them a little bit too much from the stress of the world, and they don’t get a chance to develop good coping skills,” said Israel, who is also a member of the Empathy and Balance Subcommittee.\nAt the moment, the proposed curriculum is in a planning stage.\n“Our intention is to have all four grades devote 30 hours per year to activities that fall within the scope of Empathy and Balance learning. The options for activities will be varied and include classroom learning, leadership opportunities, community engagement, capstone Senior projects and numerous other activities that contribute to the overall health and well being of individual students and of our community,” wrote Israel in an email to The Phillipian.\nIn addition to the new curriculum, Graham House will hire a part-time psychology Ph.D. student from Boston University as part of their new collaboration with the university. The student will collaborate with Graham House’s half-time intern to help maintain the workload. \n\n', 'Mar 26, 2015'), ('\nThe snow from this year’s record-breaking winter has devastated many homes and buildings all over Massachusetts, and Andover has been no exception. Surpassing the operations budget by approximately $250,000, Andover has spent an exceeding amount of money on snow-related services such as plowing and clearing snow and ice from roofs of countless buildings. The exact cost of the process is still being calculated, according to Larry Muench, Director of Facilities. \n“We haven’t seen a winter like this in decades, and the main concern was snow loading on the roofs of campus buildings,” wrote Muench in an email to *The Phillipian*. \nThis year, five hired contractors and reassigned members of the Public Safety Department worked to clear the snow and ice, causing Andover to surpass the operations budget by $250,000. In a typical winter, Andover engages one contractor to work on clearing snow and ice on a few roofs around campus. \n“We expect to spend additional money during a normal New England winter, and we build those expected costs into our operating budgets to cover. However, the events this past winter were not foreseen by anyone. We are very happy to have made it through the winter without an incident,” said Muench.\nAndover spent the money nearly exclusively on hiring contractors to remove snow from many campus buildings, Muench said. He added that, after hearing about numerous roofs throughout Massachusetts collapsing, he thought it was necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring at Andover.\nMuench said that there is no way to minimize the cost of future events like this without taking a financial gamble, which could potentially result in a loss of money.\n“We may not see a winter like this for many years, so pre-paying or having companies on retainer in an attempt save a little money for an event that may or may not happen makes no financial sense,” said Muench.\nThe funding will come from accounts held by the Trustees for operation of the campus.\n\n', 'Mar 26, 2015'), ('\n\nAfter months of planning and campaigning, Annette Bell ’16 and Theo Perez ’16 have been elected as Student Body Co-Presidents for the 2015-2016 academic year.\nThe polls opened on Thursday at 7AM, and closed at 10PM. 1009 students participated in the vote.\n“We are super excited about this role, about the possibility of being able to both generate our own creative ideas, to go out to you and get your creative ideas, and serve as a bridge to make sure that we can make this the smoothest and most awesome transformative period that it can be,” said Perez.\nBell and Perez’s platform included volunteer based dinners that would randomly seat community members together, a day student mentorship program, and flexibility in the athletic curriculum.\nIn a forum this past Wednesday, current Student Body Co-Presidents Rebecca Somer ’15 and David Gutierrez ’15 posed questions to the two candidate pairs, asking questions regarding both pairs platforms and how their ideas would benefit the school.\nWhen asked about how he and Annette would fix what the pair regarded as Andover’s biggest problem, Perez said, “We hope, as Student Body Presidents, to help facilitate… communication [between students] and to encourage students to go more out of their way to interact with larger swaths of the Andover community.”\n\n', 'Mar 26, 2015'), ('\nThis summer, five Andover students, chosen by the Office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), will be participating in the 2015-2016 CAMD Scholar Program.

Dubois’ “Souls of Black Folk,” which has an entire chapter focused on spirituals.\n“In the end I am probably going to focus on a couple spirituals [in which] the melody stayed throughout the ages, because the words have tended to change.

She has already developed relationships with Uppers and Seniors while working as a college counselor and faculty advisor, but she looks forward to meeting more students of all grades.\nSpringer felt motivated to take the position based on her history as a student activist at Wesleyan.\n“There was a lot of classism [and] ableism on campus, and we were figuring out how to have those conversations, and I would’ve been grateful to have an adult on campus whose position was specifically geared towards helping us really grasp all of that since we didn’t have that at all,” said Springer.\nSpringer recalled a movement from her freshman year in college in which she and her fellow students tried to force the institution into hiring a Dean of Diversity. During their efforts, the participants took over the School President’s office and building. \n“I’m not suggesting that it’s the most effective and the best way, but I think it was a process that I needed to go through to get me where I am now in terms of finding more effective ways to make change,” said Springer.\n“I see [my new position] as a full circle moment for me in terms of knowing that… in college I didn’t have [the knowledge and ability to properly make change] but now this opportunity presents itself here on a high school level. It excites me to think about how now, our kids will be prepared when they get to college to really make an impact,” added Springer.\nSpringer was picked from a pool of four candidates for the position as Director of CAMD, wrote Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty, in an email to *The Phillipian*. The search committee for the new position included Linda Carter Griffith, current Dean of CAMD, Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty, David Gardner, Instructor in English, Aya Murata, Advisor to Asian and Asian American Students, Patricia Russell, Dean of Studies, and Mary Jane Lewis, CAMD Administrative Assistant.\n“Ms. Springer is awesome, has lots of energy, connects well with students, is thoughtful and articulate. She is not afraid to tackle difficult questions/situations and always wants to move the conversation forward, opening up opportunities for dialogue across campus,” wrote Murata in an email to *The Phillipian*.\nSpringer has been at Andover for three years, all whilst serving as college counselor and faculty advisor for Af-Lat-Am and the Sisterhood.

At first, you’re thinking ‘oh, is this movie addressing white people?’ Then, I think quickly, you find out no. This title is just the beginning of a controversy on this campus, and that’s what you discover,” Simien said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“[The title] also happens to be a little provocative, and gets people talking, and gets people into a theater ready to think and ready to engage…you don’t come to a movie called ‘Dear White People’ just to kick back and relax and enjoy the show,” Simien continued.\nSimien said that he wants viewers of the movie to not only think about what it means to become a character in a situation, but also to discuss identity. \n“If you leave the film just talking about race issues, I think I’ve succeeded because I’m dealing with identity, but I’m dealing with it from a black point of view. Black points of views are pretty rare in our culture. If you leave with any of that, then I feel like the movie did what it came here to do,” Simien said.\nAfter growing up in Houston, TX, Simien studied film at Chapman University. Simien said that his experience at college was one of his influences for “Dear White People.”\n“I’ve always been a black person in places where I was the only black person. Or been a black person around other black people, but not feeling ‘black enough.’ So, that’s just been my black experience … the movie’s informed by my life experiences, really. I started writing it in college…because I think schools are really interesting microcosms of what’s really going on in the rest of the country,” Simien said.\nWhile at Andover, Simien also visited the Office for Community and Multicultural Development.\n“I think it’s remarkable that you even have an infrastructure in place to deal with [issues of identity] because so many schools don’t really have that, that need it… I was really encouraged by the kinds of conversations I was having. I mean you kids are really, really smart, and your brains are really, really engaged in the issues of your time, and you have a special, unique little bubble here. It was cool to just see that,” Simien said.\nSimien also discussed the lack of diversity in entertainment as a whole. Simien said that because of this, minorities can feel excluded by the media.\n“People of color, if you’re gay, or if you’re a woman, or if you’re any sort of smaller group, you’re always watching stuff that doesn’t have your specific experience in it,” Simien said.\n“Dear White People” was released in theaters last October.

They plan to offer Freshman Seminars, small discussion groups in which incoming Juniors to meet weekly to “streamline their transition into the community,” according to their platform. They also hope to improve the advising system, implement a peer counseling program, add student voices to various faculty committees and open Student Council Meetings to the Andover community.\nThe pairs will address the student body during All-School Meeting when the Spring Term begins, after which the final round of elections will occur to determine the 2015-2016 Co-Presidential pair.\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2015'), ('\nPaul Murphy, Dean of Students, warned students of possible damage to buildings due to the buildup of snow and ice in an email sent on Thursday.

The OPP teams, along with some outside contractors, have been working hard to remove snow from roofs to alleviate the loads on the structures and prevent damage to the interiors,” wrote Davis in an email to The Phillipian.\nStudents should be aware of any possible leaks in their walls or ceilings, or any dampness or wetness, as these could be signs of water damage, said Davis.\nDavis said that damage to buildings usually occurs as a result of ice dams. According to Davis, if melted snow makes its way through the roof or walls of a structure, there is the possibility of damage.\n“We are seeing this sort of damage in a variety of buildings around campus, and the extent of damage varies. The most common problem we are seeing is leaking from ceilings and around windows. The most effective way to address this problem is to remove the snow and any ice dams that have formed to prevent water from building up on roofs and damaging interiors,” said Davis. \nDavis said that while OPP has been working throughout campus to prevent the buildup of ice dams in cases where damage has already occurred, OPP will patch and repaint walls and ceilings.

As CDO, Blugh will work with Boston’s new Office of Diversity to facilitate diversity in city government personnel.  \nAfter screening and interviewing potential candidates from all over the country, Mayor Marty Walsh’s administration announced Blugh’s appointment on December 2, 2014. Blugh assumed his duties on January 5 of this year.\nAt Andover, Blugh was involved in Afro-Latino-American Society and found that race and class played large roles in nearly every facet of his life. \n“Like on MLK Day… they always had a lot of events that helped us get started having the discussions. You just saw the push for… becoming a school that really tries to live up to ‘Youth From Every Quarter,’ and to make a better student body and better institution and prepare students for life afterwards… Once all those events started taking place, it’s something that made me feel like I made the right choice,” said Blugh in an interview with The Phillipian. \nBlugh divides his responsibilities into three main areas: recruitment, minority employment support and diversity training.\n“We’re trying to get diverse talent at senior management positions, powerful positions, and to help shape city government,” said Blugh.\nBlugh plans to support smaller businesses in the city by giving more city contracts to local businesses that employ minorities, and he hopes to make Boston more welcoming as a result of increased diversity training for City Hall members.\n“We’re trying to help managers and senior positions in City Hall understand…different cultures [and] how they can manifest in making the culture [in Boston] feel more welcoming. It’s important for people to feel welcomed,” said Blugh.\nTo Blugh, being the CDO is an opportunity for him to change the general public’s image of Boston, and he says he’s willing to work through the challenges and difficulties surrounding race and identity. \n“Boston has a perception of being unwelcoming to people of color, and I hope we can get to the point where we can help change that discussion and make it that Boston is now in a place where… the people are running to look at that history, and then also look at what we’ve learned from it and look at how we’ve become a stronger city because of it,” he said.\nBorn in 1986 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Blugh lived on the tiny Caribbean nation for five years, until his parents decided to move to Brooklyn, NY. From a young age, he has been aware of the issues surrounding race, gender and class identity and how they’ve shaped his childhood. \nSince his childhood, the fight for equality across racial and class barriers in America has played an important role in Blugh’s life. In fifth grade, he enrolled in Prep for Prep, a program that prepares students of color from New York City to apply to independent schools, according to its website. \n“My parents helped make me very aware of it. Through programs such as Prep for Prep, you become, at a young age… aware of the differences and disparities in regards to opportunities, public versus private school, etc. and it’s something [that] has helped shape my academic career,” said Blugh.\nArmed with the skills to perform well in a more rigorous learning environment, Blugh moved from his old public school to the Buckley School, a private K-9 institution. From there, he entered Andover as a Junior and then attended Georgetown University.\nIn eighth grade, when he was faced with a choice between Andover, Exeter, Hotchkiss and Loomis Chaffee, he found that the students and curriculum at Andover were important factors in his decision.\n“It made me feel more comfortable. I just thought, the student body felt more right for me, and the curriculum had more flexibility there, and it just felt like more of what I wanted to do while I was in high school,” he said.  \nBlugh still looks back fondly on his experience at Andover. When asked if he had any advice to give to the students here today, he simply encouraged everyone to really get to know their peers. \n“You rarely get to spend the amount of time you do at a place with such quality individuals and teachers, that you should truly take that advantage. Everyone should really feel proud to be part of a school that’s so progressive and so supportive,” he said.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2015'), ('\nWhen Karissa Kang ’17, first heard of Leelah Alcorn’s death, she was shocked. Having never really heard about transdeath or anything trans* related before in the media, this news was rather terrifying. \nAlcorn was a transgender girl whose suicide last November sparked discussions on gender and sexuality throughout the world.\nFollowing the aftermath of Alcorn’s death, Gender-Sexuality Alliance (GSA) hosted a forum with six student panelists of varying genders and sexualities, in which Kang participated.\n“I wanted to spread awareness to the rest of the campus. I think that’s really vital.\nThat’s why I decided to participate on the panel… we get gender panels, but mostly from the perspectives of cis people, so it’s mostly conversation about sexism towards women or masculinity while this one I think brought to light trans* people and their struggles,” said Kang.\nThe forum began with the panelists describing their own personal experiences at Andover regarding their sexuality or gender. Alex Hagler ’16, a panelist, described the experience of educating some friends about asexuality.\n“I know that I have [had to educate my friends], mostly because a lot of people … don’t know about agender as a gender identity. For people who don’t know what agender is essentially, I don’t identify as a girl or boy, nor do I identify as anything in between. So I have had to educate my friends about it, but most of them did their research once they learned about my gender identity. That was not so much a problem for me,” said Hagler.\n“According to my sisters, I came out to them in seventh grade as a lesbian. Then I dropped the subject then told them again in ninth grade. I totally forgot that I had told them… It was harder telling [my family] I was agender because I was literally telling my parents and my sisters, ‘I’m actually not who you think I am. I’m a different person and that involves x, y and z.’ So I just worked up the courage randomly one night, sat down with my parents, was ‘oh yeah, hey, this is me’.” said Hagler.\nAlthough Isabella Oliva ’16, a panelist, did not have to “come out” as a cis woman, she described another perspective on sexuality at Andover. She described the moments when she realized her cis privilege.\n“[My transgender friends] don’t feel comfortable going to the bathroom of the gender with which they identify because they’re worried they’ll be ostracized there, but they’re also worried about being ostracized in the gender that they were born with or had when they were born, so they’ll ask me to accompany them so that they’re not singled out…It’s just that moment of realizing your privilege is just ‘woah,’ eye opening,” said Oliva.\nThe forum also discussed ways for students to be supportive and be allies of the trans* people on campus. Many of the panelists emphasized the importance of making an active effort to show support, particularly concerning the usage of correct gender pronouns.\nJaleel Williams ’15, a panelist and Co-Head of GSA, said, “A big thing … is just making a conscious effort to have your effort known… In my experience, I don’t get super upset when people don’t initially get my pronouns correct. I understand it’s very different, you just have to be in a different mindframe. But what does get me is when people don’t realize they’re getting my pronouns incorrectly or when people don’t take the step to correct themselves because then I feel like that part of my gender identity is not even a part of how you’re thinking, but essentially a huge part of me is invisible.”\nHagler said, “If I learn that someone is [identifying with] a different gender identity than what I previously knew I’m always like ‘what are your pronouns?’ so I can delete your previous pronouns from my head and stick these new ones in because your gender identity and your comfortableness with yourself is much more important to me than my comfortableness with your pronouns.”\nEditor’s note: In the context of the Gender Through a Cis/Trans* Lens panel, “trans*” is an umbrella term that refers to all of the identities within the gender identity spectrum.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2015'), ('\n“That was one of the reasons why I did it – to teach with her,” said Daniel Williams, Instructor in Art, who recently took up a temporary teaching position at Andover to spend more time with his daughter, Megan Paulson, Instructor in History.\nBefore coming to teach at Andover, Williams travelled from Ohio to Andover several times to visit his daughter and grandchildren. This year Williams is living on campus, filling in for Peg Harrigan, Instructor in Art, while she is on sabbatical.\n“My main concern [about living on campus] is not to embarrass my daughter. It never changes… This isn’t the first time we taught in the same school… I used to teach at a middle school in New York, and later on she got a position there, teaching. We taught at the same school but not at the same time. But this time, we are teaching at the same school at the same time,” said Williams.\nOn campus, Williams lives in the furnished basement of his daughter’s house, oftentimes babysitting his grandchildren. \nPaulson said in an interview with The Phillipian, “It’s really awesome. At first I was a bit nerve-racked, because I am clearly a product of my dad and sometimes I can be a little off the cuff, so I’m a little like, ‘Oh my gosh, what is he going to say?’ and would it be weird for me, would I feel like I need to take care of him, show him the ropes, those kinds of things. I was afraid that it was going to be strange, but it’s quite wonderful actually… [Unfortunately], we’re like ships in the night. He teaches in the morning, but his classes are [first, second and third periods], and mine are [third and fifth]… I really only see him in the house.”\n“I’ve seen sort of a renewed passion in him, and it’s something that the Andover students have given him that I really like. It’s kind of awakened him. And now he’s like, ‘Oh! maybe I will submit some work for a show,’ for things that he hasn’t really thought of. But teaching here has really re-awakened his spirit,” Paulson continued.\nWilliams says he is enjoying his time teaching on the same campus as his daughter. He said he has been very impressed with the students in his photography class.\nWilliams said, “I am very fascinated, I have worked mostly with college-level and graduate students… I am impressed with the intellectual capacity. [Students] seem very astute, and they write very well.” \nMuch of Williams’s own work as a photographer has been exhibited in museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian, Princeton Museum of Art and University of Kansas Spencer Museum of Art. He has been invited to be the visiting artist at universities such as the University of Delaware and the University of Kansas.\n“My projects and documents have to do with the social situations of mostly African-Americans… I’ve also done Emancipation Day celebrations, rites of passage and I had the first one-person photography show in the Museum of Harlem back in 1975,” said Williams.\nPaulson said, “He was never into self-promotion or anything. There’s lots of artists around like Gordon Parks and such who are much more well-known but that’s also because they were really good at promoting themselves, and my dad has a fair number of really high-profile pieces in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Smithsonian, but he never really pushed them more or anything.”\nBorn in Brooklyn, NY., and educated at Brooklyn College, Williams was taught painting by Ad Reinhardt, an abstract painter known for his major influence on conceptual art, minimal art and monochrome painting. After Reinhardt’s death in 1967, the influence of Williams’s father shifted his focus to photography.\nWilliams worked with Walter Rosenblum, an American photographer who captured the D-Day landing at Normandy in 1944. Williams went to the West Coast to do a workshop with Bernard Freemesser, who eventually became Williams’s mentor at the University of Oregon.\n“I also got in contact with Group f/64, a group of photographers whose philosophy was that photography should find its own niche and not be a substitute for painting, because early photographers imitated paintings,” said Williams.\nHe concluded his graduate studies at the University of Oregon, where he received a master’s degree in photography and went on to teach in colleges and work on his own artwork.\nWilliams has taught at Ohio University, which in 1945 became the first university to award degrees in photography. He taught at the University for 45 years before retiring.\n“My philosophy is basically to teach the student to see the way the camera sees and that the artist serves as a mirror to society. We look at artists to see where we are going,” said Williams.\nWilliams enjoys the art of Cubism, which began with Paul Cezanne, and especially appreciates Cezanne’s “Still Life with Apples.” In addition, he is fond of Constructivism, an art movement by Russian artists in the 1920s that was based on the creation of art not for beauty, but for the analyzation of materials to further the design of functional objects.\nWilliams will be staying on campus to teach photography until the end of Spring Term, when he will return to his home in Ohio.\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2015'), ('\nAfter noticing the mainstream representation of polygamous relationships in reality TV shows such as “Sister Wives” and “Big Love,” Kaylee Llewellyn ’15 wanted to explore the perception of these relationships amongst Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).\n As one of four Brace Center for Gender Studies fellows, Llewellyn presented on the strict code of conduct for women in the FLDS and the religious importance of polygamy in the community. \n“Women’s sole purpose [in a FLDS polygamist community] is to satisfy her husband because [FLDS] believe that the more wives a man has, the higher exalted status he’ll have in the afterlife,” said Llewellyn in her presentation. \nExplaining the different arguments for the legalization of polygamous relationships, Llewellyn described how one of the biggest arguments has been the evolution of the role of marriage within society.\n“Before, it was really important to carry on the family name and have as many sons as possible, but now that we’ve kind of evolved away from that, or at least now that marriage has kind of changed…we need to look at marriage as a way to fulfill oneself and make you happy,” said Llewellyn.\nLlewellyn also examined the lifestyle and experiences of women within the FLDS community, focusing on the impact that the hierarchy between men and women in polygamous relationships has on younger girls.\n“Young girls are put in a really unfortunate position because they grow up with no idea of another option. These communities are so isolated – there’s no cell phone, no internet, no radio. There’s really no kind of communication with the outside world, and so there’s difficulty to understand that there’s a different choice for them,” said Llewellyn.\nLlewellyn said that the people hurt most within polygamous communities are young girls, as they often undergo abuse and are constantly pressured to marry older men. To help resolve this, Llewellyn proposed the legalization of polygamy.\n“In that way, it might be possible for people to have polygamous marriages and do so without the abuse because currently, it’s so secretive that women are unable to speak up about it because their lifestyle is so ostracized by society,” said Llewellyn.\nAlthough Llewellyn’s presentation was largely centered on the role of women in the FLDS polygamist community, she also tackled the stigmatization of polygamy by those outside of the FLDS community.\n“I hope people took away [from my presentation] the fact that we should not attach stigmatized biases of practices that are less common. We need to examine these practices outside of our personal biases in order to determine whether or not they should be legalized,” wrote Llewellyn in an email to The Phillipian.\nSarah Schmaier ’16 said she attended the presentation because she wanted to know more about polygamy, a topic she was intrigued by after seeing its portrayal in the media. \nSchmaier said, “[Llewellyn’s] presentation was really extensive and examined lots of different perspectives on the issue, and one moment that stood out to me was her conclusion. She tied together all the complex ways that FLDS polygamy affects the members of their communities as well as our country as a whole. I now believe that this complex legal and ethical question should be discussed and debated further.”\n\n', 'Feb 26, 2015'), ('\nClustered around an oversized campus map, students waited in line to place blue and red stickers to indicate their favorite and least favorite places on campus. On another table lay a map on which students were asked to place different stickers denoting where they went to study, spend time alone or hang out with friends, among various other activities.\nThese activities were part of a Master Campus Plan forum, which took place in the Mural Room in Paresky Commons on Wednesday night.\n“We are asking [students] about [their] experience at [Andover] and we have a couple different ways we are doing that…We have these input boards that we hope will give us the input of the life of student at [Andover]…We are very interested in where [students] start and finish [their days], and the paths [they] take between those places. We’re interested how that changes by grade, from a ninth-grader to a 12th [grader],” said Eric Galipo, the project manager from Beyer Blinder Bell, Andover’s campus planning firm, during the event.\nGalipo was one of the several representatives from the firm, whose goal on Wednesday’s visit was to seek student input for developing long term landscape changes, including buildings and paths, within Andover. \nThe opinion boards as well as student feedback indicated that Morse Hall was a priority for renovation.\n“I hate Morse… It’s horrible, it’s old and dusty and always hot. The classrooms are really clunky. Renovation would make math a little less formidable because right now the tables are really cramped so I don’t even want to sit down because I’ll be constricted,” said Daniel Ulanovsky ’18 during the event.\nStudents who attended the forum said they felt their input could provide valuable insight for necessary changes on campus, such as more areas for studying and in which for day students to spend time during the day. \n“For me, places like [the Community and Multicultural Development Office] and the library are really useful because I live in a far away dorm you can go there with your friends to hang out, and they are really useful to get work done in,” said JayShawn Fuller ’17.  \nNancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, said student involvement through this forum was essential as the campus planning is centered around students’ experience. She said that the focus of the Master Plan is to establish goals for the campus buildings’ environment and how people interact with it.  \n“The Master Plan is a piece of implementing the strategic plan, and we want it to be the best it can for the students, and the only people who can tell us that are the students. [Head of School John Palfrey] has made it clear that rejuvenating the athletic complex is an [immediate] goal of his, and we have just completed an athletic facility master plan,” said Jeton. \nThe renovations to the athletic facility will include a new field house with a squash center and an indoor track to replace the Cage and Smith Center, which will be torn down to build a new pool, said Jeton.\nDavid Gutierrez ’15, Student Body Co-President, described the lack of resources that sports teams such as wrestling are currently experiencing, which would be improved through this renovation. \n“Some groups feel that they need more space for stuff. The wrestling team and the dance team just switched their rooms so wrestling has to do their practice in the Smith Center. I’m sure they would like their own space because it’s huge and they have to always move the mats a lot. I think we need a reevaluation of how space is used on campus,” said Gutierrez. \nFurthermore, he mentioned the current inefficiency of space use on campus as well as incorporating the Abbot Academy grounds into daily life. \n“I think cluttering [is an issue that needs to be addressed]. Flagstaff is a prime cluster because the area is surrounded by activity. For students living in Abbot, [the distance is longer] so I think we should work on that. We have a lot of Abbot campus that we don’t use a lot and it would be interesting to use it in the future. I think that we should integrate it into the [Andover] campus because right now there is a separation between the two campuses,” said Gutierrez. \nAlthough planning has already started, these facilities are a long-term goal to be accomplished within a decade, according to Jeton. Shorter-term changes on campus to give students the opportunity to interact with faculty outdoors include outside classrooms and picnic tables. \n\n', 'Feb 26, 2015'), ('\nSitting in a classroom in Morse Hall, Annie Zhu ’17 furiously worked through 25 math problems on the American Math Competition (AMC)-10 exam on February 3. Zhu was one of six students in the entire country to receive a perfect score on the test.\nHoping to qualify for the American Invitational Math Examination (AIME), Zhu took the exam for the third time after receiving 139.5 out of 150 both times on her first two exams. In order to qualify for the AIME, Zhu had to score in the top 2.5 percent of all AMC-10 scores.\n“The AMC-10 is a big math competition for the school because people take it into account for future competitions. It is a basis for others to judge your math level,” said Zhu in an interview with The Phillipian.\nZhu spends one to two hours per day working on problems and developing her skills. In addition, she takes Math 595 (AP BC Calculus).\nZhu said that her favorite part about math is that problem solving requires a distinct and complex way of thinking.\n“I like how [in class] we don’t restrict ourselves to testing material. Our teacher gives us challenging yet inspiring and interesting major assignment problems,” said Zhu.\nIn the past, Zhu attended math classes outside school near her home in Shanghai to prepare for math examinations and competitions. Since becoming a boarding student, however, she prepares by looking at older problems from past exams and learning their solutions.\n“Math is like athletics. You can do it everyday to maintain your level. However, if you didn’t do it for a while, your level will definitely drop,” continued Zhu.\nTo continue expanding on her skills, Zhu attends Math Club meetings every Wednesday. Advised by \xad\xad\xad\xadKhiem Doba, Instructor in Mathematics, Math Club focuses on working on problems and strategies for competitions.\n“I think that Math Club is really comprehensive because we have a very good system. We have [active] board members, and [Doba] attends every meeting. We even have organized extra practices to prepare for math competitions,” said Zhu.\nZhu said that her favorite aspect of math competitions is meeting people who share her passion for math.\n“Personally, I am not much of an English or art type of person, so I would say I feel happier when I talk about math with other people,” said Zhu.\nThe AMC-10 exam challenges students to solve difficult questions using algebra, geometry and pre-calculus concepts. Students already know the concepts tested before the exam.\n“That’s what I love about math – it’s a kind of art; you don’t really need hard techniques to solve problems. If you don’t get it, you don’t get it,” said Zhu.\nThe AMC-10 exam involves a series of 25 multiple-choice questions. For each correct answer, six points are awarded, for a total of 150 points.

In addition to visiting classes, trustees and members of the faculty explored design thinking with Kiran Sethi, who founded the Riverside School in India to combine skill and academic knowledge with an understanding of current issues in the community such as democracy and human rights.\nTrustees have woven elements of Sethi’s educational mindset, including her four design fundamentals of “Feel, Do, Imagine, Share,” into Andover’s Strategic Plan, “Connecting Our Strengths: The Andover Endeavor,” according to the press release.\nTrustees also discussed new projects such as a new field house and squash complex to be located north of Phelps Stadium.\nOther projects include the transition of Isham Health Center into full residential housing. Once the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center finishes completion in December, Isham will become a 30-bedroom dorm with three faculty apartments.\nTrustees also celebrated five members of the Andover faculty who were receiving teaching honors: Emmanuel Odjo, Instructor in French, Peter Neissa, Instructor in Spanish, Lani Silversides, Instructor in Math, Christina Landolt, Instructor in Music, and John Bird, Instructor in English.\nThese five instructors were acknowledged for their exceptional work all across campus and were recognized by faculty and students alike, according to the press release.\n“[Bird] was quirky not only in personality, but in his teaching style too. When writing essays, intros were not a thing in his class; you just had to get straight to the point,” said Evie Elson ’15.\nTrustees were able to attend classes Odjo’s French 400 class, in which he and his students examined women’s status in African society, as well as a piece by Winnie Mandela, a South African activist and politician and the wife of the late Nelson Mandela.\n“Odjo is, hands down, one of the most wonderful people I’ve ever met… His genuine care and compassion never ceases to amaze me and continues to inspire me on a daily basis. Odjo’s outlook on life and teaching style is not only refreshing, but causes me to put life into perspective,” said Catalina Feder ’15.\nTrustee Weekend also included a dinner in Paresky Commons, where members of the student Chamber Music Society performed a rendition of Peter Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence,” Op. 70. Chamber Music Society will also perform the piece in March at The Shanghai International Arts Festival.

Jiménez is also the creator of the #HSfeminism and #K12feminism hashtags. \n“The reason I started this blog was because I felt really alone. I thought, ‘Who else is trying to teach feminism in high school classrooms?’ I wanted to engage other teachers to create a community between us,” said Jiménez during the workshop. \n“I wanted to make women studies, queer studies [and] ethnic studies viable fields of study for schools. It shouldn’t just be the domain of colleges and universities,” she continued.\nIn her presentation, Jiménez urged students to participate in public speaking, civic engagement and activism and to form partnerships with other activists and academics in their community.\n“I really believe that student activists need as many opportunities to do speaking on panels, doing underground activism, appearing in the media. My students have done all those things, and I want [Andover students] to get the opportunity to do so as well,” Jiménez added.\nJiménez encouraged students to question themselves and begin the process of self-actualization. She also urged students to find adult allies around the school who can intervene with higher powers on the students’ behalves if necessary.\nJiménez has been teaching courses on feminism, queer literature, Toni Morrison and memoir writing for 18 years at Little Red School House and Elizabeth Irwin High School (LREI) in New York, NY. As an English teacher, she has students blog about issues they care about, such as rape culture, reproductive rights and media representation.\n“In many ways, the blogging in [my] class allows students to create a platform and digital citizenship to create new work in the future. The reason I had them create this blog is because so much of feminism and activism is happening online. With a blog of a website, they are contributing to the discourse and conversation,” said Jiménez.\nBeyond her own students, Jiménez hopes to educate young people around the nation about the importance of learning about women’s studies, gender studies, queer studies and ethnic studies.\n“My theory is that if we could bring women, gender, queer and ethnic studies to schools, we could eliminate racism and sexism, or at least diminish them. I think that if we taught these subjects at high schools across the nation, we wouldn’t be seeing issues like sexual assault across campus,” said Jiménez.\nCorinne Singer ’15 said she attended the presentation because of her interest in feminist activism and collaborating with other activist groups to create empowerment and effective change.\n“[Jiménez] has taught me that we, as students, hold a tremendous amount of power as activists seeking to make change. We simply have to explore and develop the ways in which we access the influence required to deconstruct systems of oppression in order to create the inclusive world we desperately need,” said Singer.\n“I enjoyed this workshop because it focused on intersectionality within feminism, which is something I am very passionate about. Every single person is multifaceted, so no one can be generalized by just one of his or her identifiers,” said audience member Rosie Poku ’17. \n\n', 'Feb 19, 2015'), ('\nThe pilot program that required iPads for Juniors in 2014-2015 will not be extended to the incoming class.\nThe decision to discontinue the program was based on a minimal uptake of iPad usage this year. Next year, Juniors will need a laptop or tablet of their choice as required by their teachers.\nPatricia Russell, Dean of Studies, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “As it turned out, because some Juniors are placed in languages higher than the 100-level and not all languages participated and because all students have laptops that they can bring to class now, we are shifting the policy slightly for 2015-2016.”\nUnder the new policy, department chairs may require iPads if and only if they will be used for all of the department’s 100-300 level courses. The students of the classes will be guaranteed two to three full years of iPad usage and the cost of the device will be balanced out by the less costly e-books.\nPaul Cernota, Instructor and Chair in Chemistry, “Personally, I don’t think that the need [for iPads exists] for so many departments and so many students that as an institution, we should commit to a single device.” \nErin McCloskey, the Associate Director of Educational Initiatives, said that the new policy will resemble the “bring your own device” policy already issued for Lowers, Uppers, Seniors and Post-Graduates. She predicts, however, that the iPad will remain the most popular device for the ninth grade.\n McCloskey said, “I think that effective learning is about good teaching and that iPads, pencils, books, phones can all be tools to support that process when used well.”\nThe iPad policy for this year’s ninth grade was implemented because most 100-level language teachers were incorporating the device into their lesson plans.\n“The iPad was seen as a device that matched the skill level of a diverse ninth-grade student body. And so at the time, that was the judgment of the best device, so everyone would have the same thing, be in the same boat and have the device needed to use in classes,” said McCloskey.\nThis year, iPads are primarily used in classes for note-taking, especially with apps such as Evernote and Notability. They are also used in the Science Department to interact with data acquisition devices, enabling students to work with their lab data. In some language classes, iPads are used to create personal eBooks, incorporating audio and video as well as text.\nCernota said, “I think like any device, [the iPad] has its good points and its bad points. There are some interesting apps that can be used on the iPad that enhance the chemistry experience. But I don’t think they are required, which is why I haven’t required iPads for my students.”\n\n', 'Feb 19, 2015'), ('\n**Why do you want to be Co-Presidents?**\nMihika Sridhar: I’ve always been really interested in student leadership…I like being a leader, and I like representing people and listening to them, talking to them and hearing their opinions.\nBrandon Girard: I love getting to know people, and I think I understand people very well. I understand different groups of people, what they like, what they don’t like and I think I can help so much with that in that sense and also I’m a leader on the field and off the field. \n**What would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?**\nSridhar: Mental health. We think it’s really important that mental health stops becoming such a taboo issue. Our main idea for mental health awareness and progress on campus is having student input in initiatives set up by adults. We want people to be aware of things that are occurring on campus. \nGirard: Sometimes it’s the small things that you don’t even realize that could just brighten your day… when I say hi to [people] and I remember their name or I say hi, it just makes people feel ten times better even if they had a [bad] day…It makes people feel good about themselves.\n**What is one thing you want people to know about you?**\nGirard: Come talk to us if you have an idea, if you have anything to say [or] if you just want to talk. I will talk. I love talking.\nSridhar: And we’ll listen, too.\nGirard: I listen all the time, because I actually care about what [others] have to say. I’ll talk but I’ll talk to ask questions so that they can talk. So it’s not going to be about me if we talk, it’ll probably be more about you. That’s okay because I like to learn about you guys and if you want to learn about me, of course. I’ll listen.\n**If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?**\nSridhar: Not Batman and Robin.\nGirard: No, because Robin is a sidekick. We can’t have sidekicks.

It’s really easy here to feel like you’re overwhelmed or you’re lost. I know that I’ve definitely felt that, and I want to make Andover a place where people feel more welcome [and] more like they belong to something.\nSayer Devlin: I think a lot of kids don’t really have a great grasp on how to change the school. Sadie and I are really committed to plausible change, and it’s not going to always be the sexiest kind of ideas. It’s going to be change that we can achieve; things that we can really work towards.\n**What would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?**\nDevlin: I think communication between faculty and students because a lot of the times, [students] get left out of the conversation just because that’s how the school is designed. The teachers make the decisions, and nothing has to go through us, nothing has to pass through any student vote or anything, but when the faculty does hear our voice, they listen. So, just getting our voice to the faculty in a respectful, tactful manner is something they’ll be more receptive to.\n**What is one thing you want people to know about you?**\nHolmes: I’d say our backgrounds are fairly important to what we are now. I am from Connecticut, my parents are divorced, I’m the youngest of five siblings so I’m really a team player, but I can also be independent because I’m much younger than my siblings.\nDevlin: I’ve lived all over the world. I live in Boston now, but I’ve lived in Tokyo, Paris, London and New York. So I have this really diverse cultural background, I’ve lived in three really distinct, different cultures, and I think that’s really cultivated this really different perspective from a lot of kids. \n**If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?**\nDevlin: I feel like we’re The Incredibles, just the whole family, because they have such different powers and they’re different people but they come together really well to make a great team.\n**What is your campaign theme song?**\nHolmes: “Style” by Taylor Swift.\n*Sayer Devlin is a Copy Editor for* The Phillipian *CXXXVIII.*\n\n', 'Feb 19, 2015'), ('\n**Why do you want to be Co-Presidents?**\nSloane Sambuco: We have a lot of good ideas – we’ve both been here for all three years, and we just really love Andover.

One specific way we hope to foster community and inclusivity is through improving the advising system.\nSambuco: The system we have now has little student input in choosing advisors. If students can choose their own advisors, the relationships will be much more valuable and the mentorship more meaningful. Also with community, we want to integrate friend groups and help people get to know everyone from the start at orientation. Also, we want to introduce student-mentoring programs based on common interests with Juniors and upperclassmen.\n**What is one thing you want people to know about you?**\nRedding: It’s really important that people know that we always want to talk with them. One of the most important things about being a leader is knowing that your voice is not the most important one. We are so eager to learn what the students have to say.\n**If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?**\nRedding: I think Sloane and I would definitely be the Fantastic Four because we’re fantastic and we’re, like, two people in one, each of us. It’s like four of us in two!

A lot of people get lost, – a lot of people feel unsupportive. People who aren’t boarders or who come in as older students feel unsupported, and really that’s such a terrible thing – coming into a community and not feeling like there’s support there for you.\nBell: I think having a strong community, which also stems from mentorship, would guide everyone’s path and make them happier here. Another really important thing that we should look at is having options for sports, whether it’s more slides or more changes for you to do what you love. Not everyone loves to do sports all the time – maybe it’s music, maybe it’s theater or maybe it’s they just want a break.\nWhat is one thing you want people to know about you?\nPerez: [Students] should feel free to sit down at my table if they see me in Paresky Commons!

We don’t want leadership to have this image that you have to be super authoritative and polished and perfect and eloquent and commanding, because that’s not what leadership is. True leadership is being able to empathize with the student body, represent the student body, support the student body, whilst simultaneously being part of the student body.  \n**What would you say is the most important aspect of your platform?**\nSingh: Exeter’s equivalent of Graham house trains select uppers and seniors to be peer counselors. These uppers and seniors attend weekly workshops about problems. A lot of times, I think it’s hard to approach adults, because they don’t necessarily know what you’re going through, and so to have peers that you can go to that are specially trained to talk to you and to listen would be so good for this community.\n**What is one thing you want people to know about you?**\nWill Bergstein: It might seem that I might just want to be president because there’s a social connotation… but I actually care. This is a position that I feel like I can do well and that I care about. I honestly think that some people think this is just another leadership position, but I really care a lot. \nSingh: I would want people to know that, to put it simply, I’m a very sincere person. The things we’re advocating for on our platform are things that I truly believe in and try to change individually on a daily basis.\n**If you were a superhero duo, who would you be?**\nSingh: Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They are that idea of friendship. They are not just two random superheroes that happen to work together.

But in reality, they have little in common with the urban children. The migrant children face all sorts of inequalities, just like their parents, and the most visible form of the inequality is the education they receive,” said Wang. \nIn addition, Wang mentioned that many of the migrant children’s statuses as students do not qualify for them to attend the public schools because they are not from the city. As a result, many rely on education from private schools (unassociated with the government or the Ministry of Education in China) that often have poor facilities, untrained teachers and a lack of support for the children. \nWang emphasized that the constant increase in school fees coupled with workers’ low wages makes it extremely difficult for migrant families to financially support their children’s education. Consequently, many migrant worker children end up dropping out of school at an early age. \nJoyce said that it is necessary to look beyond the migrant schools and further examine the governmental structure of China in order to relieve the inequalities faced by migrant families everyday.\n“Migrant schools are simply one phenomenon rising from a bigger issue….simply regulating or eliminating migrant schools is far from enough to guaranteeing migrant children’s better education. It is important to look beyond migrant schools and find the roots of social barriers which lie in China’s complicated social and political structure, marked by an ineffective government,” said Wang.\nWang’s presentation was followed by a guest speaker, Richie Zhang ’16. As a founder of Student Alliance for Assisting Migrant Worker Children (SAFAM), Zhang spoke about the mental health of migrant children.\n“Due to the complicated environment that many migrant children are faced with, they receive a lot of pressure from society, from their schools and also from their parents. That, added together, brings a lot of psychological pressure,” said Zhang. \nZhang has previously travelled to migrant schools himself as a volunteer to teach migrant children in camps. His organization, SAFAM, currently also partners with nongovernmental organizations such as Teach for China and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). \nLikewise, Wang has spent her past summer in Beijing, China, interviewing and connecting with migrant families. She added that working hands-on to get to know these people was her favorite part about the research process.\n“My part of the fieldwork was interviewing scholars from both China and America, visiting different schools, volunteering at the camp, interacting with migrant children and their parents and visiting their homes. This was definitely an educational experience, and it really made me feel the intensity and severity of this academic issue,” she said.\nAlthough her research as a CAMD scholar on this issue has come to an end, Joyce hopes to continue being involved in nongovernmental organizations to help alleviate the situation of the migrant families in China. \n\n', 'Feb 19, 2015'), ('\nPhillips Academy Model United Nations (PAMUN) won the Outstanding Large Delegation award at the Boston Invitational Model United Nations Conference (BosMUN), a highly competitive MUN competition hosted by Boston University.

Redding and Sambuco plan to promote a sense of community by tailoring the advising system to individual students and creating a comprehensive student mentorship program. Similarly, the pair plans to foster inclusivity by continuing the conversations of social justice that have stemmed from CAMD.\nMarcello Rossi ’16 and Caroline Shipley ’16 created a platform that hinges on three main objectives, the first of which is to create effective communication between the student body and a more transparent administration so students are not blind-sided by sudden changes in policy. Another objective is the creation of an internship program in conjunction with the alumni network to give Andover students greater access to learning experiences in potential fields of interest. Additionally, the pair hopes to focus on giving students more activities and opportunities for fun, like having a Color Run or hosting more dances.\n\n', 'Feb 16, 2015'), ('\nLight box therapy, a substitute for daylight that can restore balance, mood and energy, is currently being offered on campus. These energy lamps, which are known as “Happy Lights,” are available for use in Isham, Graham House, the Office of Community and Multicultural Development and the Academic Skills Center during regular office hours in each location. Instructions for use and feedback cards are provided in all light box areas. \nLight box therapy is used to treat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), according to the website of the Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit medical practice and research group. \n“Researchers believe this type of light causes a chemical change in the brain that lifts your mood and eases other symptoms of SAD. Most people use light boxes for a minimum of 30 minutes each morning,” wrote the Mayo Clinic Staff.\nLight boxes are typically used for anywhere between 15 minutes to two hours, according to research published by Columbia University. For the best results, light boxes should be used early in the morning.\n“Depending on when bright light is presented, the body’s internal clock—which controls daily rhythms of body temperature, hormone secretion and sleep patterns—shifts ahead or is delayed when stimulated by light,” according to the research conducted by Columbia University. \nThe light boxes were funded by the Abbot Academy Association.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2015'), ('\nOver the course of one week, teachers will shadow students throughout their day, observing all of their classes and extracurricular activities.\nDavid Gutierrez ’15, Student Body Co-President, proposed the idea to the scheduling committee three weeks ago.\nGutierrez, who has collaborated with faculty members to brainstorm potential schedule changes since the beginning of the 2014-2015 school year, proposed the shadowing program in order to give teachers greater insight into student life and to understand the effects of transitioning between classes. Throughout the weeklong project, a single teacher will shadow one volunteer student.\n“I know that most of [the teachers] know that we’re really busy, but it’s different to experience [a student’s schedule]. I would say that just experiencing what [students] actually experience is what they need to know because you can hear all about the theories like ‘students are busy, students are doing this and doing that,’ but until you actually live it, it’s a whole other thing,” said Gutierrez.\nJennifer Elliott, Dean of Abbot Cluster and member of the scheduling committee, said that one goal of the shadowing program is participation from several different departments and offices. \nShe added that the scheduling committee is specifically looking at the transitions students make between their classes every day. \nElliott continued that students lose a total of 13 minutes of learning each class due to transitioning between classes, citing a study conducted by an outside consultant who visited campus. “[The consultant’s] data supports that students lose 6.5 minutes at the end of every class — sort of their minds [are] distracted and they’re thinking on the next thing, and the first 6.5 minutes of both classes, kids’ minds are still on their last class,” she said.\nGutierrez, who was inspired by a “Washington Post” article about a similar experiment in public school, hopes that that the program will give faculty members a better-informed perception of student life, so they can tailor their teaching styles to students.\n“[The teachers in the public school] saw how hard it was to sit down and focus for 45 minutes because of … the pedagogy that was going on in the classroom… I was hoping that this accomplishes the same thing; that we see that, while Andover itself is very good at teaching, maybe there are things that could be improved,” said Gutierrez. \nEliot added, “Most [teachers] try to shake up our teaching style so that there is some variability, so that it’s not just lecture-based [or] discussion-based, it’s more action-based, but I think it would be good for [teachers] to get some real first-hand experience to get a sense of how long the kids are sitting [in class].”\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2015'), ('\n**Above, Isaac Newell ’18 (center) won the GeograBee on Tuesday.**\nPoised with their hands above their buzzers in Upper Left of Paresky Commons, the five finalists in the 19th Annual GeograBee listened anxiously to the final question: “In the 1840s, the Sultan of Oman relocated his capital to a small island off the coast of East Africa. Name this island, which became a center of ivory and slave trade.” \nOn Tuesday, Isaac Newell ’18 became the 19th GeograBee champion with a total of 24 points out of the maximum 90. Chris Russo ’15 got second place with 17 points, and Akhil Rajan ’17 placed in third with 16 points.\n“I honestly did not expect to win since I had heard how knowledgeable some of the other competitors are beforehand. The competition was definitely very intense and also I got off to a slow start, so I was a bit anxious during the 30 questions. After winning, I was pleasantly surprised that I did it,” wrote Newell in an email to The Phillipian.\nThe competition was moderated by Christopher Jones, Instructor and Chair in History, and was organized by Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator. \nThe intensity of the competition contrasted with the relaxed atmosphere of the audience, as onlookers broke out in laughter and applause as participants raced to the buzzers with answers ranging from Iceland to Ouagadougou.\n“With the buzzer system you have to be on your toes and ready to push the buzzer as fast as possible. That got me a little nervous since I’m not always very good at getting things fast,” said Newell.\nDespite this, Newell ended up winning the round, breaking the two-year tie streak between Abbot and Flagstaff Clusters.\nNewell said that although he did not train specifically for the GeograBee, he reads world news and is passionate about world geography.\n“I regularly read the news, so keeping up to date on current events inherently teaches you some geography and provides a context for remembering it. I also enjoy looking at maps and I have an atlas and globe in my room in Pemberton Cottage which I look through occasionally,” said Newell.\nThis year, the all-school finalists were given monetary prizes. The winner won $100, the student in second place $50 and the third-place participant $25.\nParticipants in the finals answered 30 geography questions. The contestant that answered the most questions correctly was declared the winner. Contestants gained three points for each correct answer and lost one point for each incorrect response.\nAt the dorm level, each dorm that showed 100 percent participation and answered an average of 50 percent or more of the first ten questions correctly in the preliminary round qualified for a pizza munch in April. \nThis year, Abbot and Flagstaff Clusters tied for the top scores in the preliminary round, with both clusters scoring an average of 73 percent correct answers in the first ten questions.

She will succeed current Principal Thomas Hassan.\nExeter chose MacFarlane from a diverse pool of many accomplished candidates, including independent school heads, leaders in higher education and other talented educators, according to the Exeter press release.\nAfter serving as a teaching fellow at Exeter for a year, MacFarlane spent 28 years teaching American Literature classes and seminars in the English department at UNH.\n“She is well-prepared and a remarkable fit. She is an accomplished scholar, committed teacher and sophisticated administrator,” said Tom Hutton, President of Exeter’s Board of Trustees and a member of Exeter’s principal search committee, in the press release.\nBelle Burden Davis and Tony Downer, co-chairs of the search committee, both said that, after performing thorough research, they felt confident about MacFarlane’s ability and are excited to begin a new chapter at Exeter under her leadership.\n“I was very happy at UNH and really hadn’t thought about leaving, but the Exeter search committee called and asked if I would speak with them. That first conversation was very engaging and comfortable, and after each subsequent one, I felt more excited about the opportunity,” wrote MacFarlane in an interview with The Phillipian.\nMacFarlane wrote that one of the most exciting aspects of Exeter is the “Harkness” method of teaching, which involves students sitting around an oval table and participating in discussions with minimal interference from instructors. She looks forward to returning to this method, after years teaching at UNH. \n“I am a huge Harkness fan—not just as a pedagogy, but also as both a philosophy for how we should treat one other and as an epistemology for how we might think about the world. The challenges of the 21st century make those practices and values absolutely vital. I’m really looking forward to working with the entire Exeter community to imagine how to carry the spirit of Harkness and the principles of the Deed of Gift into the future,” she wrote.\nThe Deed of Gift was written by John Phillips, founder of Exeter, in 1781. The document funded Exeter’s creation and asserts the guiding values of the institution of Exeter.\n“The Principal at Exeter, as laid out in the Deed of Gift, is the Principal Instructor, which I love: it puts the emphasis on how we teach and learn together, which is the heart of the Academy, and it reminds everyone that the faculty (and staff) and students work together to achieve that,” said Macfarlane.\n“The Principal Instructor’s job at Exeter is essentially the same as the Head of School at Andover: to be responsible for creating the best possible environment for students, faculty and staff to learn together, and to help the Academy imagine and achieve its future,” she continued.\nMacfarlane added that meeting the diverse community of students that attend and have attended Exeter will be the most exciting opportunity for her.\nMacFarlane said that she particularly enjoyed learning English, history and art history at Andover, but the inspiring people in the Andover community made the greatest impact on her.\n“Andover was transformative: everyone was passionate about something, and everyone respected that about each other. I had never been in that kind of environment before, and it opened my eyes to what was possible, and what I should expect of myself,” MacFarlane said.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2015'), ('\nThe Tuition Refund Plan, which ensures certain families their tuition money back if a student leaves the school, will be modified so that families now only have to pay 1.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent of the total tuition. Families that pay the full year’s tuition and all other extra fees by July 15, 2015 will be given the option to opt out of the plan; for everyone else, the plan’s 1.5 percent tuition fee is automatically added to the student’s bill. The income from this fee will then be used to refund students who leave in the middle of the year 65 percent of the tuition cost of the remaining days of the year. The new plan will be implemented in the 2015-2016 school year.\nThis policy change occurred in light of a recent trend in which the fees paid no longer covered the cost of the refunds. Andrea Nix, Director of Finance and Assistant Treasurer, attributed this to the school’s leniency when offering the Plan to students who paid the tuition in one payment at no additional cost.\n“I realized that too few people were paying in to cover a lot of the school, and a lot of the reason for that was that families who paid in full in advance in the summer were getting [the Plan for] free. We were saying, ‘If you pay in full, we’ll give you the tuition refund plan with no charge.’ But we couldn’t afford to do that anymore,” said Nix.\nAs a result, Nix contacted several other boarding schools in the area, among them Choate, St. Paul’s, and Exeter, to learn about their tuition refund policies. After comparing the policies at these schools to Andover’s, Nix realized that a smaller fee spread across a wider pool would help cover the policy’s costs.\nOver the last few months, Nix began revising Andover’s policy in conjunction with Sharon Kramer, Associate Comptroller for Operational Accounting, and Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer. After considering a 0.5 percent, 1 percent, and 1.5 percent decrease from the present 2.5 percent fee, they settled on 1.5 percent of the total amount paid by each student, which would not include the portion paid by financial aid and the enrollment deposit.\nNix also debated whether to switch to an insurance company or to remain self-funded. While communicating with the other schools, she discovered that the majority of them used an insurance company that would handle these calculations. Andover decided, however, that the flexibility gained from staying self-funded would outweigh the added costs to the school.\n“We like the idea of self-funding it because it gives us more flexibility. I was at another school, and we used an insurance company, and they have rules, like, ‘No refunds if you leave before October 1 … We want to be able to be more in control of how we run it,” she said.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2015'), ('\nMichael Barker, the current Director of Institutional Research and Assessment, will replace Elisabeth Tully as the new Director of Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), effective July 1, 2015. Although Barker will be the new Director of the OWHL, he will also be keeping his current job, which entails researching and analyzing data that the administration uses to make decisions. \n“It’s a blending of both roles, and I think the combining of these two different positions is a great opportunity for [Andover] to create one big research hub where a faculty, staff or a student can come anytime to ask any questions they may have, whether it’s related to a library research project or analyzing data,” said Barker. \n“I’m fascinated with what libraries can do for the community and how people, especially students, use the information they have access to. Google doesn’t necessarily get you all the way in the research process. There’s a great deal of information literacy and understanding how to find good research that I think factors into how kids grow and how they approach solving problems in the future,” he continued. \nBarker said that one of the most important part of his job will be listen to the desires of members of the community.\n“For example, a lot of people have different ideas on how to use community space or buildings and resources, and I’m interested in what everyone has to say. I love the analogy of the library as the heart of the campus, and I almost wonder if over time we can think of the library as the central nervous system of campus, where it receives a lot of different feedback and reports it back out to the community,” said Barker. \nIn an email to the Andover community, Head of School John Palfrey wrote, “I have every confidence that [Barker] will take on this new position with vigor and great skill. This position will encompass the duties of library director as well as matters of institutional research. It is my view that libraries have a greater, not lesser, role to play in communities in the era of digital technologies than in our analog past.”\n“In this expansion of the duties of this position, and through [Barker’s] appointment, I expect that the role that the OWHL plays at the very center of our community life will continue to grow richer and yet more connected. [Barker] is just the person to build upon the great tradition of our library, on which Elisabeth Tully and others have built and to establish great new connections and pathways into the future,” he continued. \nBarker said that the most exciting part of his new position will be combining the various skill sets required for his role.\n“No other school is considering about how a library can work in this way. We are constantly thinking about what the library is today and how we can redefine it for the community,” said Barker. \nThis is not the first time Barker will be working at a library, as he served in a variety of significant leadership roles in the Harvard Library, both at the university level and as the manager of a major unit at the Harvard Law School Library, before his transition to Andover about a year and a half ago. \n“There was a period two years ago where Harvard had a great big idea to rethink how libraries worked for the university. They asked me to be on a special team that rethought how the libraries would operate. In a way, it was an institutional research on libraries, how users used the library system in each school and what materials, resources they were using to run the whole system,” he said. \nSince joining the Andover faculty in May 2013, Barker said that his experience at Andover has exceeded his expectations.\n“My time here has been absolutely fantastic. It’s a campus that talks a lot about important issues such as class, gender, race. I think it’s really healthy and I take a little personal pride in being part of that discussion and facilitating it through various methods such as the school-wide survey we implemented last year,” he said.\nBarker looks forward to interacting with students in discussions on how to improve using library space in the future, as well as including them in analyzing data. \n“If you look around the library at night, it’s over 300 students looking for a seat, not adults. I hope I can work with the students and think about ways we can bring various disciplines together, such as [Independent Projects],” said Barker. \nBarker will be working closely with the Dean of Students, librarians and the Tang Institute in his new position. \nThe search committee for the new position included Trish Russell, LaShonda Long, Erik Morales, Mary Mulligan and Nancy Jeton.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2015'), ('\nCarrie Ingerman ’15 delivered a presentation entitled “Educational Rights of Students with Disabilities: An Analysis of the Past, Present, and Future of Overcoming Ableism in Independent New England Boarding Schools” on Friday in Kemper Auditorium as the Barbara Landis Chase Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar. \nThe presentation focused on disability rights at Andover and peer schools. “Students with disabilities add value to our community and should be treated as individuals of our diverse community,” Ingerman wrote in an email to _The Phillipian_.\nIngerman also discussed the relevancy of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) of 2008 to schools like Andover.\nUnder the ADA, discrimination on the basis of ability was declared illegal, and many additional rights for students with disabilities were explicitly guaranteed in both public and private schools.\nIn 1999, Andover was sued for not following the ADA. In Axelrod vs. Phillips Academy, a student argued that the school did not provide necessary accommodations for his disability. The school won the lawsuit, but the case prompted Andover to take measures to improve student disability services.\n“The underlying premise of the ADA is that people with disabilities are able to participate in many aspects of life, and should be entitled to such participation, but are prevented by a variety of barriers,” said Ingerman. \nIngerman added that she believes the ADA was not a perfect end to ableism.\n“[Under the ADA,] a school is not obligated to lower its standards, or academic requirements for admission, retention or graduation,” said Ingerman, who became especially passionate about disability rights after developing a disability herself three years ago.\nAdditionally, if accommodations would be a large burden to the school, financially, the school is not required to undertake them, which could potentially limit academic opportunities for students with disabilities, Ingerman said.\nToday, the Academic Skills Center (ASC) offers assistance to students with disabilities. Only six out of the 40 dorms and seven academic buildings on campus, however, are fully wheelchair-accessible. \nIngerman’s presentation also featured a talk by Randy Pierce, a hiker who was the first blind man to climb all 48 of New Hampshire’s tallest mountains.\nPierce is the founder of “20/20 Vision Quest,” a non-profit organization that encourages disabled persons to achieve feats similar to his.\nPierce was born without a disability, but developed his blindness later in life. It was initially very difficult for him to come to terms with his situation, but in the end he was able to find new ways to live his old life, he said.\n“I think the [the most important thing] is the notion of believing in yourself… I think it’s the ability emphasis that is key… whether you have a disability or not,” said Pierce.\nIngerman’s presentation was fourth in the series of CAMD scholar presentations this year.

The SLAM alumni also met the members of the current team and collaborated with them on a new routine that they later performed at the basketball games.\nCurrent Co-Captain Alejandra Uria ’15 said, “SLAM alumni stories get passed down every single year, and I’ve been hearing about SLAM alumni since my first year on the team. Being able to see them in the flesh and collaborate with them was almost like the experience of meeting a celebrity in a really fun and weird way.”\nSLAM has been an Andover tradition since 1995, when Angela Brown ’96 and Ashanti Hosier ’95 decided to create a unique dance team on campus. \nUnlike many high school cheerleading teams, SLAM combines traditional cheerleading step-dancing moves with complex rhythms and sounds created by a combination of hand claps and foot stomps in sideline performances. \n“People’s memory of SLAM sticks with them, even beyond graduation. When the alumni returned to campus, I could see that stepping and SLAM particularly… continue to be important to them and holds significance in their lives. When we invited them to step with us, even though a lot of them hadn’t done that particular step in a really long time, they were all able to remember it after a little bit of practice. I could see how thoroughly happy they were to perform with us,” Uria added.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2015'), ('\nHead of School John Palfrey announced a $5 million gift from Peter Currie ’74, President of the Board of Trustees, to the endowment of the Tang Institute in a press release on January 28.

The ability to test new ideas, iterate and adapt are highly sought qualities in today’s economy,” said Currie.\nPalfrey added, “I see the Tang Institute as Andover’s contribution to what will be a highly distributed global conversation about the future of secondary education… The establishment of the Institute with such generous support marks great progress towards that vision.”\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2015'), ('\nStarting with the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi and ending with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 12 Andover students will embark on a journey to the American South this June through “The American Civil Rights Movement Immersion Program.” This is the newest addition to the ‘Learning in the World’ program series sponsored by the Tang Institute, which include summer programs such as Niswarth, Huaca, Piette, and more.\nStudents will visit cities in the American South such as Montgomery, Memphis, Atlanta and Birmingham to gain a deeper understanding of the atmosphere of segregation and racism that existed across the South, according to the Tang Institute website. Students will also have the opportunity to discuss the lasting effects slavery, Jim Crow laws and legal cases that dealt with issues of civil rights.\nThe purpose of the program is to open students’ eyes to the systemic issues in modern society and inspire them to seek change, said Judith Wombwell, initiator of the program and Instructor and Chair of the Department of Theatre and Dance.\n“It is difficult to understand, and perhaps, it is easy to ignore some of the ongoing systemic problems facing our nation. When you travel through the south and visit some of these iconic sites, you understand how heroic ordinary people were in the face of horrendous oppression and violence,” said Wombwell.\nThe trip will also explore the link between race and poverty. Students will also visit impoverished cities and rural areas.\n“Rural and urban poverty are extremely different and for somebody not from the south like myself, and seeing that first-hand was truly an eyeopening and shocking experience,” said Allen Grimm, faculty chaperone of the trip and Instructor in the Theatre and Arts Department, in his initial visit to scope out locations.\n“Just going to a church or crossing the bridge in Selma, seeing how people were treated and simply being there was particularly moving. The emotions were very palpable,” Grimm said. \nHe hopes this program will help students connect to and experience the Civil Rights Movement and other aspects of American history first-hand. \nWombwell said, “We will see the balcony where Dr. King Jr. was assassinated, visit the birthplace of the blues, and stand on the steps of the capitol building in Montgomery.” Students will also visit the kitchen in which Dr. King had his spiritual epiphany and the location in which Rosa Parks led her protest. \n“It was incredibly emotional to look not only at the historical events, but at the problems and poverty that currently exist in so many areas,” said Wombwell.\nIn addition to visiting the iconic sites, students will participate in a three day learning experience in the Mississippi Delta at the Sunflower County Freedom Project, where they will collaborate with middle school age students through theater games and exercises. \nThe Freedom Project is inspired by the freedom struggle in the 1960s. According to its website, the project works to promote educational excellence and leadership development of young people in the community. \nCurrently, 12 students are signed up for the program, which is scheduled to last approximately ten days.

The blizzard, dubbed “Juno” by the National Weather Service (NWS), began Monday night and covered Andover with over two feet of snow by Wednesday morning, according to the NWS. In response to the snowstorm, Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life, emailed the Andover community Monday afternoon, informing them that classes, as well as sports and community service, would be canceled and that Tuesday would be considered a “snow emergency day.” In an interview with The Phillipian, Murphy said that the decision took into account the conditions, timing and duration of the storm, as well as the day of the week and the positions of national and state organizations. “It has to be a fairly severe case for us [to cancel classes],” said Murphy. The storm took place during Wellness Week, forcing the cancellation of all programming on Tuesday. Weather conditions made it difficult for many of the other speakers to arrive on campus, forcing the cancellation of many other Wellness Week programs on Monday as well. To prepare for the impending storm, Paresky Commons provided shelves of “grab-and-go” food for students to take back to their dorms on Monday night, so that students would not have to leave their dorms during the worst part of the storm on Tuesday morning. Paresky was open Tuesday morning, as was Isham, but all academic buildings were closed. All off-campus events were cancelled. The state of Massachusetts also implemented a ban on all non-essential travel, which forced many staff members and administrators to stay on campus through Monday night. “There are essential folks that must come in, and sometimes they need to stay overnight in order to perform those functions,” said Murphy. The Office of the Physical Plant (OPP) set up cots in the Abbot Gym, the Power Plant and the Maintenance Building so that workers could stay overnight on Monday and Tuesday, wrote Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, in an email to The Phillipian. Muench said that OPP workers worked in shifts, with one shift working from Monday night until midday on Tuesday, and the second shift working from midday Tuesday until Wednesday morning. Their work mostly involved snow removal, though Muench said that workers did respond to a fire alarm at a dormitory, a broken window and several complaints about broken heating systems. Workers at Paresky also spent the night on campus, sleeping on cots in Susie’s. About 20 workers at Paresky volunteered to stay on campus Monday night and Tuesday night, said Michael Giampa, Director of Food Services. Paresky workers last stayed overnight during Winter Storm Nemo in February, 2013. Classes eventually resumed Wednesday with a slightly altered schedule. Instead of beginning at the usual 8:00 a.m., first period was postponed until 2:00 p.m., and classes started with second period at 9:25 a.m. The extra time was used to allow shoveling teams, designated by dorms and cluster deans, to help clear the snow. Additionally, volunteers were solicited to clear snow on Tuesday afternoon. “Every storm we get better and better,” Murphy said. A primary concern beforehand was whether or not day students would be able to get to school on Wednesday, according to Murphy. “I think it was a very small number [of day students that could not get to school on Wednesday],” said Murphy. Community service and interscholastic sports were cancelled on Wednesday and the library reopened at noon. “We’re trying to get back to normal as fast as we can,” said Murphy. The two feet of snow recorded in Boston was the sixth-highest amount totalled in the city since 1935, according to “The Boston Globe.” Boston public schools were closed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nOn his first day playing football, Bill Littlefield ’66 was knocked unconscious by another more experienced football player. This incident ended his one-day career of football at Andover. The rest of his Junior season was spent shivering on the outskirts of a soccer field, watching his team play from the sidelines. Fifty years later, Littlefield is the host of “Only a Game” on National Public Radio (NPR) and was the keynote speaker at Wednesday’s Wellness Week All-School Meeting (ASM). In his speech, Littlefield discussed the importance of athletics in our culture, emphasizing the pressure on both professional and student athletes to compete. Littlefield began his speech by reading an excerpt he had written describing a soccer game in his neighborhood. He illustrated the loose form of the game, the inattentiveness to rules and the sheer fun and joy involved in the game. “There are high school kids in my town who really like playing soccer but who didn’t make the varsity soccer team or they didn’t care to try out … So they play on Saturday afternoon for fun. They shout encouragement at one another. They laugh at one another without malice… This game [is] played simply for the sake of playing the game,” said Littlefield. This concept of playing sports simply to play is an anomaly in the current sports culture, Littlefield said. Littlefield highlighted the seriousness that is expected of student athletes when participating for their college team. He emphasized this point by describing a moment nearly 90 years ago involving a Harvard-Yale football game. “In 1925, before Yale and Harvard played their annual football game, the Yale coach… is alleged to have said to his players, ‘Gentlemen, you are about to play football for Yale against Harvard. Never again in your whole life will you do anything so important,’” said Littlefield in his speech. Littlefield described the hyper-importance that many schools place on certain sports, specifically football. “College football presents a fascinating case study, having defended for decades [a] preposterously hypocritical multibillion-dollar system in which the most successful coaches make tens of millions of dollars a year and the workers don’t get paid,” said Littlefield. Littlefield went on to discuss the lack of payment to college athletes, and the ways in which colleges are responsible regarding long-term athletic issues. “The term ‘student-athlete’ was coined in part to take colleges off the hook in that regard. If they’re students, they’re not workers, and if they’re not workers, there’s no worker’s compensation,” Littlefield explained. Addressing the pressure that coaches and parents put on their children to excel at all costs, Littlefield talked about performance enhancing drugs and the issue of weight loss, particularly in football. “I’ve known Division III football players who weighed over 300 pounds who told me that their coaches have said they should lose weight unless they could get quicker without losing weight,” said Littlefield. Littlefield said that many children feel pressured to specialize in one sport when they are young. As a result of this, some students in middle school have already committed to a single sport to play in college. Others attend numerous camps and train with several teams to increase their skill. “If [student athletes] want to advance… they have to be expected to join select and travel teams. Sometimes they play on these teams as well as on their high school teams and sometimes they have to pick, one or the other. Often they are expected, if not pressured or required, to attend camps for their sports… I recently read about a quarterback camp — not a football camp, a quarterback camp — where the youngest campers are eight years old,” said Littlefield. For Littlefield, American culture takes sports too seriously. He reminded the audience that sports, at their core, are recreational pastimes. “At lots of levels, athletes provide us with images of perfection or at least images of important truths such as that if you want to work hard at something, you’ll get better and if you build something as a team, the rewards can be more enduring than winning… But at their best our games can delight us and they can teach us and they can enrich our lives as long as we keep in mind that they are games,” said Littlefield.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nStanding next to a row of lights and video cameras, Jessica Chermayeff ’04 watched artist Kehinde Wiley photograph a cluster of models. Chermayeff served as a producer for “Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace,” a 2014 documentary about Wiley that featured as one of eight films on a shortlist for nomination as Best Documentary Short Subject for the 2015 Oscars. While on set, Chermayeff was taken by surprise when the film’s director and other producer, Jeff Dupre, asked her to interview the models. Yet, despite her nerves and lack of preparation, Chermayeff sat down and spoke with the models. “For me that was one of those very nerve-wracking moments in the beginning of anyone’s career, because I had to sort of wing it and pretend like I knew exactly what I was doing when I wasn’t sure if I did… But that was also a very personally exciting moment where I got to realize that sitting down and interviewing a subject is the moment when you make a real connection with somebody. You can use that not just to get what you need on film, but also to build a relationship and forge a connection that can help to tell a story in a way that I’d never really known before,” said Chermayeff in an interview with The Phillipian. Chermayeff’s interest in documentary film stemmed from a passion for photography and non-fiction writing she fostered during her time at Andover. In particular, Chermayeff’s work on an independent project with Seth Bardo, Instructor in English, for which she photographed and wrote about the work of Habitat for Humanity, piqued her curiosity. “[That project] is what really sparked my interest in image-making and storytelling to talk about people’s lives and their stories in a way that has a social importance and helps people look beyond the world that they’re normally living in,” said Chermayeff. Though she was an anthropology major at Brown University, Chermayeff also took Arabic classes and courses within her field that related to film, including courses on Arab film. After graduating in 2009, she headed to Los Angeles to work for BoomGen, a company that at the time focused on media and the Middle East. “I was very interested in things that came out of and were centered around the Middle East, and the media relationship between the West and the Middle East. I worked for the company BoomGen in [Los Angeles]. I did a lot of work at the time about the Green Movement in Iran. So at the time I was doing journalistic short form content around the Middle East and a lot of small projects with my friends, just small things to just test out what things you like doing,” said Chermayeff. Chermayeff moved to New York City in 2011 to work at Show of Force, the media company of her cousin Maro Chermayeff ’80. She served as Associate Producer of the 2012 PBS mini series “Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.” This was Chermayeff’s “first foray into a very large-scale production” before beginning work as a field producer for a follow-up mini series ed “A Path Appears,” she said. At the same time, Chermayeff also began work as a producer for “Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace,” a documentary about the creative process behind New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley’s portraits of African-American women. “[‘Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace’] was an incredibly consuming project over a long period of time. It was the first film that I was a full producer on, so I had such an enormous amount of say in what we were able to do and how we were able to follow the story, which was incredibly exciting for me,” said Chermayeff. Chermayeff said that producing is a multifaceted job that includes not only gaining access to the subject of a film’s story, but also fundraising and finding other team members. “[Producing] is a lot of communication and management of teams and maintaining a singular goal and focus, which is often hard on a project like [‘Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace’] because there were many times when we thought we didn’t have enough money to finish it. [The project] did work, but we didn’t know if anyone actually wanted to see it… [Producing] is really about maintaining that kind of faith in a project, and maintaining everyone’s faith and excitement can often be quite challenging,” said Chermayeff. While she has concentrated her career on producing, Chermayeff hopes to also direct in the future. Ultimately, she wants to continue pursuing documentary filmmaking. “I think the really amazing thing that documentary filmmaking can do is [get] different communities to interact, whether that is seeing them interact on screen or meeting each other through a film project. [Documentary filmmaking] is a very humanizing medium and there’s nothing quite like seeing or hearing somebody talk and live,” said Chermayeff.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nA self-described “language-nerd,” Yasmine Allen, Instructor in Spanish, has a love for learning new languages and culture that extends far beyond Spanish. From Japanese to Portuguese, Allen boasts a bountiful repertoire of new languages, as she seeks every opportunity to expose herself to a new language. “I just love the idea of meeting new people and accessing new languages and cultures, or accessing the people through the language and culture, and being able to talk and converse with millions of people through that medium,” said Allen. Aside from teaching two sections of Spanish 400, Allen serves as the Chair of the Spanish Department, House Counselor at Nathan Hale and a spinning instructor. She was also recently appointed as the new Assistant Dean of Faculty. Attending a Spanish-American bilingual school in Maryland, Allen was surrounded by a diverse group of students from a young age. “[The school] was probably more than half minority. I grew up with people from El Salvador and different Asian countries, including Korea, Laos, Cambodia. It was very diverse, and I like to get to know different people, so I guess that’s how I started my love of culture and language,” said Allen. In addition to receiving a Master’s Degree in Spanish at DePauw University, Allen decided to pursue Portuguese in college after befriending one Brazilian and two Portuguese friends in high school. “I learned about [Portuguese] culture through them, and, considering the similarities between Spanish and Portuguese, I was immediately interested in learning the language,” she said. Fascinated by Japan’s culture after taking a class on traditional Japanese literature in English at DePauw, Allen also decided to take a Japanese language class her senior year in college. Allen’s passion for new languages continued through graduate school, where she not only continued taking Portuguese classes as part of her Master’s Program at Purdue University but also took a summer course in Italian. Beyond the classroom lectures in college and graduate school, Allen has had the opportunity to visit Portugal and Brazil, where she was able to flaunt her new language skills and immerse herself in their culture. “Travelling to the places where I could speak their native tongue was an amazing experience. I would love to go to Japan one day. I haven’t been beyond the Iberian Peninsula in Europe… so I would also love to visit France and Italy as well,” said Allen. At Andover, Allen is currently auditing a French 200 course, taught by Debra Pickering, Instructor in French. Last year, she audited French 110/120. Furthermore, Allen had the chance to visit Quebec City over the summer, where she was able to practice speaking French. “It’s wonderful [auditing French]. I’m a ‘language nerd,’ so just to be back in the classroom again is wonderful. I absorb everything, and I just want to speak French everywhere,” said Allen. Allen hopes to relay her passion for new languages to her students. “I tell my students: ‘When you come into the classroom, adopt the culture. Become a different person. You’re not necessarily your English-speaking self, you’re your Spanish-speaking self.’ When I go to Panama in the summers, I’m a different Mrs. Allen when I’m in Panama than when I am here. Immersing yourself in a new language and culture makes you think of yourself differently… it makes you view yourself through a different lens. You’re changed by the people you meet, the food, the culture you experience,” she added. Apart from her love for learning new languages, Allen also enjoys spinning, an aerobic exercise performed on stationary bikes in the gym. Although she was intimidated at first by the cold gym rooms and shouting instructors, Allen was hooked after she tried her first class. “Riding on the bike is like meditation. I’m in the zone, especially when I am climbing up a hill. Once I tried spinning and experienced the cardiovascular benefits of exercising on the spinner bike, I wanted to continue incorporating these workouts into my weekly routine,” she said. Allen teaches 45-minute classes per week during the winter and spring terms and usually tries to get on the bike before the term to start training for the upcoming season. She has been instructing spinning classes since she got certified in 2010.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\n“Maybe we need some kind of bifocals to take it all in — the darkness and the light, our own lives and the lives of others, suffering and joy, if it is out there,” read Jeffrey Harrison from his poem “Vision.” Harrison, a lauded poet and former Writer in Residence and Instructor in English, returned to campus for a reading last Friday in the Freeman Room of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. Harrison read a selection of his favorite and most celebrated original works from throughout his career. In his poetry, Harrison covers a variety of topics, all inspired by his experiences and surroundings. “[Inspiration] could be almost anything. Something might trigger a memory about my past and I’ll write about that, or it might be something I see while I’m taking a walk and I want to write about something right now in the present. It’s just more a matter of… some connection coming in your head, or a first line. A poem will come in different ways,” said Harrison in an interview with The Phillipian. Growing up, Harrison wrote fiction, but reading English and French poetry in high school sparked an interest in the subject. “I kind of wanted to cast that spell that poetry can cast, [the spell] that I was experiencing reading poems in English and French class,” said Harrison during the reading. Harrison began the reading with a poem entitled “The Other Sister,” in which the speaker recounts a childhood lie he told his younger sister about having an estranged older sister named Isabel who had run away to California and become a drug addict. “What my motives were I can’t recall: a whim, or was it some need of mine to toy with loss, to probe the ache of imaginary wounds?” read Harrison. Next, Harrison read a poem entitled “Listening to Virginia,” which chronicles the speaker’s experiences sitting in a car and listening to Virginia Woolf’s “To The Lighthouse” on audiobook. The speaker of the poem describes the reader, Virginia Leishman, possessing him with her voice and the words she is speaking. “It is almost Woolf herself sitting beside me like some dear great aunt, who happens to be a genius, telling me stories in a voice like sparkling waves,” read Harrison. Harrison also read a poem called “Cross-Fertilization,” which used the forced fertilization of flowers as a metaphor for the loss of virginity. He described the challenge of pollinating a flower with a Q-Tip, creating a metaphor for the awkwardness associated with early sexual experiences. “[This] leaves me in the dark, transported back to a state of awkward if ardent unenlightenment, a complete beginner figuring it out as I go along, giggling a little and humming an old song,” he read. Harrison’s expressive tone struck audience members and left them with a deeper appreciation for free verse poetry. His voice recognized the dips and turns of his own work, shedding a deeper light on their significance. Sydney Olney ’17 said, “[Harrison’s] poems were just so beautiful. They brought forth this kind of nostalgia. The free form was just really different. You don’t see that a lot because so many writers are so obsessed with making everything perfect and his were intentionally imperfect, and I really enjoyed that.”\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nAn increasingly high number of students suffering from infectious diseases, including fevers related to seasonal influenza, strep throat and the common cold, have reported to Isham this month, according to an email sent to faculty, staff, students and parents by Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life. As a result, numerous hand sanitizer stations have been located in every building on campus, including Paresky Commons. Paresky has also put additional measures in place, such as changing serving utensils more frequently, keeping gloves near self-serve stations to hold shared utensils and get food and using disposable utensils, according to the email. Ill boarders will remain in Isham until they appear well and their fever has subsided for 12-24 hours, and those with less severe symptoms have been sent back to their dorms to rest and recover. Because of the limited number of available beds in semi-private/shared rooms in Isham, parents of local boarders who live within a two to three hour radius have been asked to take the them home to recover, if possible. According to the email, those students should remain home for 24 hours fever-free, without the use of fever-lowering medications, until they can resume their normal activities. The same applies to faculty and staff. Symptoms of the seasonal flu include any combination of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, body aches, headache, fatigue and, less commonly, vomiting or diarrhea. As a precaution, Murphy advised students to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, choose nutritious food options and minimize stress.

Having worked at Andover since 1991, Marmolejos said that he has stayed at Andover for the past 24 years because he loves working with food and making students happy. “I make the students feel comfortable, feel like they’re home and feel like they can come up to me and ask me questions,” said Marmolejos in an interview with The Phillipian. “I like what I do. I’m a happy guy… I’m passionate about food and I’m passionate about what I do here at [Andover].” Marmolejos is one of approximately 80 staff members who work at Paresky Commons for Aramark, an award-winning food services company. The types of jobs around Paresky include preparing food, cleaning the dining halls, restocking the salad bar, filling the juice machines and carving fruit and vegetables into elaborate decorations, among various other duties. Hailing from Lawrence, Mass., Miguel Angilo covers all four kitchens with a focus on the lower skillets. During lunch and dinner he can be found behind the stir-fry counter, sizzling chicken and vegetables while chatting with students as they wait in line for stir-fry. “I like customer service; I like to be nice to everybody and be helpful,” he said. Angilo especially enjoys making breakfast omelets for the students in the morning, and he hopes to one day own a restaurant, where he will be a breakfast chef. At Paresky, staff members are assigned jobs based on their training, although there are many opportunities for staff members to switch roles during their careers, said Mike Giampa, the Food Service Director and Sustainability Coordinator of Paresky Commons. “For example, we have a dishwasher right now who wants to learn how to cook. So he does his regular job of doing the dishes, and when he is not busy, the chef [trains him to cook]. Right now he is starting by cutting vegetables, since that is where most people start. You learn how to cut vegetables, then you learn how to make soup… it is a step-by-step process. We do a lot of that with our employees,” said Giampa. The planning and preparing of the food takes a lot of time, work and thought, Giampa said. Menus are carefully planned out a month before by the chef, the food service directors and staff members. “We use a production system called PRIMA to plan all of our menus and help us with ordering, inventory, recipes and production. We don’t get up one day and say we’re going to have chicken tomorrow. It is planned ahead [of time]. It is a four-week cycle, and that is how we do our menu engineering,” said Giampa. The food itself, however, is usually prepped the day before and cooked the day it is served in order to maintain freshness. Proteins or any other products that need to be stored under 40 degrees Fahrenheit are kept in one of the walk-in refrigerators and pulled out for use the next day. David Florencio, who has only worked at Paresky Commons for the last eight months, has already found a home cooking dinner in the Upper Left kitchen. Florencio used to work at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Lowell. He said that he prefers working at Andover to working at UMass Lowell. “Everything [here] is different. It’s more organized, and we have better, healthier food here. [At UMass,] there are more hamburgers and hot dogs. I enjoy working here,” said Florencio. In addition, for special events including cluster dinners, Mixed Heritage Awareness Week and Latin Arts Weekend, the Paresky staff frequently works with different student groups and faculty members to coordinate themed meals. “All of the special meals, we plan with the student groups. I like to do it a couple of weeks before the dinner itself so that gives us time to do some research and bring in all the food. It is still prepared the same way; we prep it the day before and cook it that day and night,” said Giampa. Aramark has been working with Phillips Academy since 1991 to provide healthy meals for students and faculty in Paresky Commons. The workers at Aramark work in shifts throughout the day: the morning and dinner food service shifts last from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., respectively, the maintenance staff members work from 3 p.m. to 12 a.m. and the Susie’s staff members have separate shifts that follow the Andover students’ schedule and curfew.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nLast Thursday, Graeme Griffith pled guilty to the theft of over $149,000 in government benefits over the course of 11 years.

Linda Carter Griffith continued, “I will not let this affect my professional life in any way… I remain deeply committed to my work here at Andover, and I hope that my family situation will not be a distraction for others.” Graeme Griffith’s father died in 2003, but Graeme Griffith continued to receive his deceased father’s monthly Social Security benefits from 2003 to 2014, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. The benefits totaled $149,285. A pre-sentence investigation was ordered after Graeme Griffith’s guilty plea on Thursday, January 22, 2015. The sentencing hearing is scheduled to occur on April 16, 2015. Graeme Griffith has since resigned from his position as an academic counselor at North Shore Community College. “We’ll take it when it comes. We’ll prepare as best we can at this point,” said Linda Carter Griffith. “We’re very hopeful that this will end in the best case scenario that it can. There is a long road ahead, but I’m going to put on my running shoes, hiking boots, snow boots… We’re going to get there.” “My work is actually, in many ways, a salvation. I love my job, and I think these are also times when you take every blessing you have, and you are grateful for it. Coming to work each and every day remains a joy — it is my life’s passion, my life’s work,” she said. Linda Carter Griffith said she has received kindness and support from students, alumni and other faculty members. “I am incredibly grateful… It’s tough, but I’ve been feeling the support of others, and I never knew that that made as much of a difference as it does… My colleagues in the [CAMD] office have been phenomenal.”\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2015'), ('\nSitting in Cochran Chapel during last year’s Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Day All-School Meeting (ASM), Jack McGovern ’15 heard Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, speak about Brian Gittens ’89, who 25 years ago led a protest on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall over Andover’s limited recognition of MLK Day.\n “When I heard that story, I was inspired by the activist, [and] as a filmmaker I knew there had to be much more behind the story,” said McGovern.\n McGovern then set out to make a documentary on Gittens’s 1989 protest. The ten month long project, entitled “The Story of Brian Gittens” was premiered in Kemper Auditorium this Sunday. \n “What Brian Gittens showed in this act is that every student has a voice … it’s important to realize the power that each person has in the school,” said McGovern.\n For McGovern, the documentary was a chance to explore the topic of multiculturalism, a topic he said he was unfamiliar with. \n “I love listening to the perspectives of others and at the same time practicing empathy,” said McGovern.\n Even though the topic was new territory for McGovern, he was able to express it in a familiar medium: film.\n “[I wanted] to use my skills as a filmmaker to document the story… keep that story in the Andover community for a very long time,” continued McGovern.\n Following the film premier on Sunday, there was a question and answer session where audience members could pose questions to McGovern and Gittens.\n “[After watching the movie], I took away the fact that students have power and often underestimate how much influence they actually have,” said Tyler Craigwell ’18, an attendee of the film.\n “I went, because it was a part of my own interest…it was related to my identity and ethnicity,” said Moyo Oyebode ’18. \n The movie will be shown again this Sunday in Kemper Auditorium at 12:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nThe clock struck 2 a.m. on Saturday morning as writers for Flash Films shook up soda cans, rushed into the showers in Foxcroft Hall and sprayed each other with soda in an attempt to overcome writer’s block.\nStarting at 8 p.m. on Friday, Flash Films’s directors, writers and actors congregated in the common room of Stimson House to begin the process of creating short films. After initial introductions, the group exchanged funny stories to inspire the screenwriters. As actors and directors slept, the writers worked in Foxcroft and Stimson until 5 a.m., writing and editing each others’ work with the goal of completing short films.\n“Flash Films is just fun. It’s a good challenge, since a lot of times with filming, [films] get stretched out and diluted when you spend too much time on them. With Flash Films, you get it all done in one day, so you can’t possibly get tired of your work,” said Lane Unsworth ’15, Co-Head of Andover Moviemakers’ Club (AMC), which organized Flash Films.\nAt 8 a.m. on Saturday, the directors chose their scripts, then began filming with the actors at 9 a.m. After filming wrapped up at 4 p.m., the directors headed to the Polk Lillard Center to edit their work. All the films were screened at 8 p.m. in the Underwood Room.\n“I think the screening went really well, but we did have some speed bumps along the way. We had actors who tried out who got sick, writers and directors who dropped out at the last minute and all sorts of things, since Flash Films is a pretty big time commitment to dedicate an entire day to,” said Unsworth. “I think in the future, when this becomes an event people know about more, it’ll be less of an issue because people can plan ahead.”\n**“Happiness and Sadness, Coexisting in Unexpected Unity”**\nWritten by Jihoun Im ’17 and Jackson Lee ’17 and directed by Anastasiya Prokhorenko ’15, “Happiness and Sadness, Coexisting in Unexpected Unity” is a spoof on a romantic Korean drama. A Korean-language film, the drama follows Max, played by Max Chung ’15. In the beginning, English subtitles indicate that the film is about Max losing his girlfriend, Jen, played by Jen Kim ’16. In an attempt to win her back, Max goes after Jen, who then professes her love for him. When Max brushes her off and asks in English for her Netflix account password, the film is rewound to the beginning to display the correct subtitles, revealing that Max was making aimless, irrelevant comments while Jen was hurt and confused but still in love with him.\n“Since we knew Max and Jen speak fluent Korean, we were thinking it would be funny if we made a spoof on a romance type film. And so we spent an hour watching Korean dramas before we got to writing,” said Lee.\nFor Prokhorenko, the time frame of Flash Films was both constraining and inspiring.\n“You have to think faster, because you don’t have time to sit down and plan it out,” said Prokhorenko. \n**“HEY DIRECTOR (Yeah, you) THINK OF A CREATIVE TITLE THAT IS MEANINGFUL”**\nWritten by Andrew Lin ’17 and Alex Emerson ’17 and directed by Lin, “HEY DIRECTOR (Yeah, you) THINK OF A CREATIVE TITLE THAT IS MEANINGFUL” centers around two friends, Erin and Amy, studying in a practice room in Graves Hall. When an unknown figure passes the door, Erin, played by Sadie Holmes ’16, and Amy, played by Corissa Hollenbeck ’16, are suddenly locked in the room. Black-and-white cinematography, creepy music and distorted camera angles build up anticipation for the revelation of the identity of the figure. The figure slowly opens the door and is revealed to be Unsworth, asking the two girls if they wanted to participate in a Flash Film.\n“Writing this year was pretty interesting, because it was fun to see how the actors interpreted my lines. There were a lot of things I wrote in there that I didn’t expect them to take that way, and it was usually for the better, as 2 a.m. thoughts tend to be weird,” said Emerson.\nLin said, “It’s a little difficult when you’re working in a room that small, and, since it was A Day With Andover, there were a lot of people coming in and out of Graves. At a bunch of points, we had people walk straight into the room while we were filming.”\n**“The Pearson **** Paradox”**\nWritten by Unsworth and directed by Darius Lam ’17, “The Pearson Paradox” follows a girl named Betty, played by Avery Kim ’17, who suddenly finds herself in a time paradox in Pearson Hall after telling a friend to sign onto PAnet. She meets Dave, played by Fran Trautmann ’16, who is also stuck in the time paradox. The two travel in circles around the Andover campus trying to find their way out of the paradox, until Betty realizes that she created their predicament by telling her friend to sign onto PAWIRELESS instead of PASTUDENT. \n“I really liked the idea of this circular, going-and-coming-back-at-the-same-point idea. I took major inspiration from the recent film ‘Interstellar,’ since there’s this part where the main character manipulates his past but that leads him to the future,” said Lam.\nLam valued the close, familial environment that Flash Films created.\n“Everyone else was working on their own films in the Polk Center, and every five minutes we’d go around and check up on how everyone was doing, and if anyone needed help, we’d just come over and help them. It’s this cohesiveness within all of the directors, and even the actors, even though they didn’t have to show up, they showed up anyway to see how everything was going,” he said.\n**“The Loo”**\nWritten by Hanover Vale ’15 and directed by Emerson, “The Loo” follows a student named Mandy, played by Candy Chan ’17, locked inside a bathroom in the Gelb Science Center. Mandy loses her mind in an attempt to entertain herself until the toilet begins to talk to her, revealing itself to be a student trapped in the toilet by a witch many years ago. \nMandy frees the toilet ghost, played by Tessa Jarden ’16, who then unlocks the door, so both girls can exit the bathroom.\n“I was inspired by the story I shared in Stimson about a toilet that was in a backyard and had been used by children as a cauldron. They would make witch’s brew in it, and they ended up putting gasoline in the toilet and lit it on fire accidentally,” said Vale. “[Other inspiration] came from my friend who was a Senior last year, who found himself locked in a Gelb bathroom for a half hour with a dying phone until a friend came and rescued him.”\n**“Discovery Channel’s The Phillips Academy Very Scary Death Competition: With Behind the Scenes Extras!!11!!1!!11!!!!”**\nWritten by Aidan Driscoll ’17 and directed by Ethan Brown ’17 and Driscoll, “Discovery Channel’s The Phillips Academy Very Scary Death Competition: With Behind the Scenes Extras!!11!!1!!11!!!!” tells a story of a fight to the death between a participant from each cluster. R, played by Driscoll, is victorious after outlasting Bronk Swagaliciousness (Joe Okafor ’17), Rebecca Dark-Grey (Hannah Berkowitz ’17), Francis Edward Jones III (Alex Davenport ’17), a nameless day student (Unsworth) and a lemon.\n“[Unsworth] said to come up with an idea, so I just thought of something pretty quickly. I worked until 3:30 a.m., and I just wrote whatever came into my mind. I thought of ‘The Hunger Games’ and shaky camera, since I thought that was pretty cliché, and then I just went from there,” said Driscoll.\nBrown said, “The whole process was so much fun, but it was also difficult since it was a windy day, so in the editing process, there were lots of issues with the sound. It was noticeable in all of the films, but we did the best we could do with it.”\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nAfter consistent improvement in each of its first three meets, Andover Girls Swimming secured its first win of the season against Loomis Chaffee last Saturday, winning 103-80. The win improved Andover’s record to 1-3.\n In an email to The Phillipian, newcomer Emma Donchi ’18 wrote, “I think that what allowed us to win this meet was our greater sense of unity as a team. We have been working really hard during practice over the past week and have gotten to know each other better, not only as swimmers but also as friends.”\n Andover got off to a quick start, taking both first and second in the 200-Yard Medley and earning a total of 12 points. Miranda An ’15, Co-Captain Elizabeth Duserick ’16, Allyson Ty ’18 and Donchi made up the team that placed first, while an all-newcomer team of Yifei Wu ’17, Jess Gearan ’18, Sarah Zhao ’18 and Juliette Farmer ’18 placed second.\n The two Andover teams finished at 1:54.69 and 1:57.51.\n Returner Katherine Sweetser ’17, a top-performing swimmer at Andover this season, had two first place finishes in the 100- and 200-Yard Freestyle. Her victories helped Andover take first place in the Team Relay. In total, she contributed 12 points to Andover’s team score. Sweetser swam a 56.25 in the 100-Yard and a 2:01.42 200-Yard, both of which were personal season records.\n In an email to The Phillipian, Sweetser wrote, “I think a win was what we needed. We know what we can do, and we know what we can work to achieve. We will continue to push ourselves and support one another in the pool and outside of the pool.”\n In addition to the strong performance from the swimmers, Andover diver Tessa Ingler ’18 competed in a meet for the first time this season. Ingler added three points to Andover’s final score with a third-place finish in the One-Yard Dive.\n Co-Captains Soubie Im ’15 and Duserick have been critical in motivating the girls and allowing the new girls to feel as if they are a part of the team.\n Gearan, who is in her first year at Andover, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “Our Captains are supportive and encouraging. They push us to set high goals and to achieve them by working hard at practice. Being new to the team was not stressful at all. All the girls were so welcoming and made me feel a part of the team immediately.”\n This week during practice, the girls focused on smaller details and improving endurance, which will hopefully help catapult Andover to the top of the league.\n In an email to The Phillipian, veteran Qiqi Ren ’15 wrote, “We will be training throughout the week for the meet against Northfield Mount Hermon (NMH), so we don’t have to worry about tapering [off] at the end of the week.

Being the first [home] meet of the season, we were ready to swim hard and give it our best.

Co-Captains Aaron Teo ’15 and Alex Li ’15, Christian Alberga ’17 and Ty won the medley in 1:39.10, while Marcello Rossi ’16, Li, Teo and Alberga won the 400-Yard Freestyle.\n Rossi continued his streak by clinching two individual wins in the 200-Yard Freestyle in 1:48.49 and the 500-Yard Freestyle in 4:56.05. Ty also won two events, the 200-Yard Individual Medley in 2:00.81 and 100-Yard Freestyle in 48.82.

Matthew Grottkau ’17 got his best Diving result this season with 166.40 points.\n Faulkner wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I think we are a very deep team with lots of talented swimmers in different events. Our relays were definitely a strong point because they demonstrate how deep we are. The fact that we had four different swimmers come first in [multiple] events is also huge.”\n While Andover physically dominates in the pool, the team’s spirit and camaraderie continues to grow as the season goes on.\n Ty said, “Being around mid-season, I think we are continuing to really come together as a team. I would say that, [by continuing this trend], we can really help each other improve a great deal by the time championships come by – both in and out of the pool.”\n Andover will travel to Northfield Mount Hermon this weekend to try to extend its winning streak to three games.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nReflecting on past Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Day events, MLK Day Planning Committee members Josephine Pandji ’16 and Margot Shang ’16 speculated that student interest in MLK Day could be amplified if students began thinking about the day earlier.\xa0\nTo this end, Shang and Pandji created a website, mlkandover.com, to allow students to explore the workshop topics ahead of time and look at student artwork based off of MLK Day themes of identity.\nThe website includes short descriptions of each workshop offered on MLK Day, along with workshop locations and timings.\xa0\n“The workshops are really powerful I think because they can really be the spark that catalyzes [your thoughts], but if you have that catalyst beforehand, it can only elevate what the workshops can do for you,” said Shang.\n\xa0The website exhibits 21 pieces of student artwork, including poetry, sculptures and paintings.\n“I think some of the visual poems… have an underestimated power because it’s easy to flip through [the artwork] and …some of the [other] ones are a little more eye-catching that others but the stories articulated in [the visual poems] are really moving,” said Shang.\nImpressed by the number of submissions they received for their art section of the website, Shang and Pandji are optimistic that even more artwork will be submitted in future years.\xa0\n“We had people just respond to general prompts [of] what they thought about identity or all these different factions of race, but next year we might… add different components because I think a barrier for submissions was that the prompts were almost too open ended. People didn’t know what to do. I think what we’re going to do [next year] is almost make even more little pockets of this overall campaign so that people understand a little more specifically what they can do to contribute,” said Shang.\n\xa0“Since this idea has [already] been set down for this year, everyone knows about it, they go on the website and they see the art submissions, [Next year,] people will be more likely to submit. [We’ll] also reach out to more people and maybe different groups and clubs and see if people would like to contribute to the website,” said Pandji.\n\xa0The website also included a music video featuring members of Azure, Keynotes, Yorkies and Gospel Choir singing “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson.\n“We chose ‘Man in the Mirror,’ because the song’s narrative encapsulates both the message we wanted to share with the student body and the purpose of the art campaign. ‘Man in the Mirror’ is about simple observation sparking a need for change in an individual. That was the essence behind the entire campaign.

Amy Patel, Medical Director at Isham, said that this upward trend is not only present here at Andover, but also at schools around the country.\nConcussion diagnosis and awareness have been prioritized at Andover in the past few years, with every new student taking the ImPACT baseline concussion test every two years. Additionally, there have been recent changes to concussion protocol: students may now be kept in Isham for up to 72 hours.\nThe ImPACT testing was first used by the training room for athletes. Eventually, every student was required to undergo testing during the fall of their first year at Andover as a baseline model.\n**Concussion Protocol\xa0(according to Isham)**\nWhen a student is first diagnosed with a concussion, or traumatic brain injury, he or she spends 24-72 hours in Isham, under a strict protocol of complete rest. After leaving Isham, students slowly resume normal activities, starting with academics and progressing towards athletics and other extracurricular activities.\n“The symptoms are self-reported. Students have to share what they’re feeling, and Isham uses the student’s statements to determine when to do a follow up test,” said Marlena Ysalguez, Academic Skills Specialist.\n“Once they are back to their baseline [ImPACT] assessment, they can start integrating back into academics and work with our Athletic Trainers on a ‘Return to Play’ protocol. If they go through all of this without symptoms, then they have the green light to reintegrate completely,” Patel said.\nStudents with traumatic brain injuries can miss anywhere from a few days to several weeks of classes, including major assignments. Patel emphasized that the recovery process is best taken slowly.\n“When I got to Andover I figured out a short-term plan for me to work with the trainers,” said Lila Brady ’18, who suffered from a concussion before the start of her Junior year.\n”I started out doing really low-impact workouts. After two months, I was feeling pretty good, so my parents and I pushed to go to the next step and increase my activity level,” she said.\n“Students can go to class, but they can’t take anything high stakes while they’re symptomatic,” said Patricia Davison, Coordinator of Student Disabilities and Director of the Academic Skills Center.\nIn the case of an elongated recovery, students can seek the assistance of the Academic Skills Center (ASC). The ASC works with students to set a schedule for making up work, and works with teachers to compromise on some assignments.\n“We never compromise the integrity of the course. Anything that’s essential cannot be waived. They have to prove at the end of the term that they’ve done all the essential requirements in the course,” said Davison.\nAlthough Isham and ASC provide support for students, not all faculty members are familiar with concussion procedures.\n**Psychological effects**\n“It’s like telling an opera singer they can’t sing, telling a kid here that they can’t use their brain,” Davison said.\n“One of the worst things about having a concussion here is not knowing how much of it is in your head and how much of it is an actual medical condition. That insecurity was probably the most challenging part of my injury,” said Lucius Xuan ’15, who suffered a concussion during his Junior year.\nThe anxiety often associated with missing work has been proven to exacerbate concussion symptoms, Davison said. In efforts to catch up too quickly, many students end up setting themselves back farther.\n“Sometimes in recovery, you can take a few steps forward and then have a setback, which is really anxiety-inducing for many students,” said Patel.\nRiley Hughes ’17 said, “Even though falling behind is upsetting, they keep telling me it’s all about my health. It gets kind of frustrating, because I want to push myself to just jump back in, and in this case, I can’t.”\nThroughout combating student anxiety and frustration, Andover and Isham continue to support students by prioritizing their health and resuming their normal lives in the most manageable, healthy way possible.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\n!carousel[54c2eada6c6f63336c2f0000, 54c2eb406c6f63336c310000, 54c2ec036c6f63336c330000]\nOn Thursday, January 22, Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty, sent an email to the faculty announcing the appointments of Martha Fenton ’83, David Gardner and Tedd Parker as Cluster Deans of West Quad North, Pine Knoll and Abbot Cluster, respectively. \n Fenton, Gardner and Parker were chosen from a pool of eight applicants.

Accompanied by his boombox and posterboard, Brian Gittens ’89 was perched on the steps to protest what he saw as an inadequate observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Day.\n One by one, students began to join Gittens’s public demonstration. By the time about 30 students had gathered, Gittens was reciting a short speech he had written the night before, encouraging students to stand up for what they believed in just like King had. What had started out as one student’s initiative to spark change soon erupted into a passionate crowd of 100. Gittens’s bold decision to engage in a personal act of civil disobedience would come to establish Andover’s first annual day-long MLK Day celebration a year later.\n As Andover celebrated its 25th annual MLK Day celebration this Monday, Gittens returned to his alma mater to discuss the inspirations that led him to the steps of SamPhil. Speaking to a packed Cochran Chapel during Monday’s All-School Meeting (ASM), Gittens reflected on his successful attempt to fix Andover’s limited recognition of MLK Day as a national holiday. \n “At Andover, we would celebrate the program after the school day was over, and I remember during my Upper year thinking there was something amiss. Not celebrating MLK day as a national holiday and conducting business as usual was symbolic of Andover’s limited commitment to its students of color,” said Gittens during the ASM. \n Gittens grew up in Baltimore, MD., as the son of a nursing assistant and an electrician. “When people ask me where I’m from or how I grew up, I usually provide the HBO series, ‘The Wire,’ as a frame of reference,” said Gittens.\n Gittens recalled the protests during his childhood that advocated MLK Day as a national holiday, in which supporters were encouraged to boycott business and schools. Growing up at the center of social activism, in addition to mainstream media, Gittens learned about King and his impact as a civil rights leader at a young age. \n “I was often reminded by teachers and mentors of our indebtedness to those who came before us… how we should not take for granted the freedoms and the paths to success that were carved by the courage, blood, sweat and tears of those who came before us,” said Gittens. \n Although he immediately fell in love with the place that was nothing like “The Wire,” Gittens described his relationship with Andover as a complicated one. \n “[At Andover], I struggled with finding a self that I could be here and take home. I struggled finding my voice among the noise of who I was supposed to be or expected to act. While I discovered many beautiful things at Andover, I also discovered the depths of my differences from those around me,” said Gittens.\n Gittens said that, although Andover had been focusing on getting more minority students on campus, the notion of inclusiveness was still a work in progress at that time. However, over the course of the next two years, Gittens said that he finally discovered and became comfortable with his own self.\n Gittens said that he finally found his voice on the day he decided to lead the student protest 25 years ago. \n “This only became possible when I stopped caring so much about the opinions of others and focused rather on being the best me that I could be. I also learned to love Andover, and it became my school — my Andover,” he said. \n Gittens added that his actions were not only his protest but, rather, a movement shared by many in the Andover community. \n “Your takeaways, reflection, critical thinking and developing a genuine concern for others is your challenge as emerging leaders. There will be a time when you will have your critical moment… My hope for you is that in that critical moment when you are called upon to make a stand, that you show courage in the face of adversity, that you will not take the easy way out, but rather find your true voice and exercise authentic leadership,” he said. \n Upon graduating from Andover, Gittens served in the Marine Core for 13 years and earned a Bachelor’s in Communication as well as a Master’s in Public Administration from Virginia Tech. Gittens earned his doctorate in Higher Education Administration from George Washington University.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nWith the puck in Exeter’s defensive zone, Collin Nugent ’16 whipped a pass across the ice to find Kenny Griffin ’17, who fired a shot that slipped past multiple defenders and the goalie for his first goal of the season.\n “I basically just made myself available for a sweetheart pass from Nugent,” said Griffin after the game. “It was a great feeling to not only get my first goal but to also help swing the momentum of the game.” \n Cutting down a 2-0 deficit early in the second period, Griffin’s goal sparked an Andover comeback that led to a 3-3 score at the end of the second period. Jack Cusack ’18 followed Griffin’s effort with a tipped shot exactly two minutes later, and Jake Tomsik ’17 contributed a goal later in the period.\n Despite the mini-comeback in the second period, Andover remained scoreless in the final period of regulation and eventually fell to Exeter 4-3 in overtime.\n Andover, which boasted a 5-5-2 record before the game, was the underdog against an undefeated Exeter team. An exceptional team performance, however, kept the team in contention until the final minutes of overtime.\n “We did a great job of coming out with intensity,” Griffin added. “We were all there to play a solid 54 minutes.”\n Strong performances from young members of the team showed promise for seasons to come. Griffin and Cusack are both new players, while Tomsik is currently playing in his second season for Andover.\n Starting Right Wing Tyler Levin ’16 said, “Our young guys stepped up and made a difference in a game where we really needed it. Everyone played hard, and, although there were some lapses, I thought our [defensive] core played especially well.”\n The offensive partnership between Levine and Nugent has been productive for Andover this season. The pair has produced 15 goals and 17 assists thus far. \n “I would have to say around eight of my assists were to Nugent. Nugent has [ten] goals and six assists, and I would have to say five or so of his assists were to me,” continued Levine.\n Boys Varsity Hockey lost its next game 4-2 against St. Sebastian’s on Wednesday, bringing its record to 5-7-2. Defenseman and Assistant Captain Kyle Moss ’15 and Levine tallied goals for the team. \n Andover has recently struggled with its power play and in its last three games, the team has been unable to find the net on eight power play opportunities.\n Andover looks to return to its winning ways against Thayer on Saturday.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\n_Point guard Eric Alperin ’15 controls the pace of Andover Boys Basketball. A two-year Senior, Alperin has proven to be a significant asset to the team the past two seasons. An unquestioned leader and well-rounded player, Alperin not only scores skilfully, but also delivers the ball to his teammates all over the court. Alperin has hit ten three-pointers in his last three games. Over the same stretch of time, he has averaged 14 points and five assists per game. _\n**What game have you been most proud of, both individually and team wise?**\nA lot of my stronger individual performances don’t equate to the team winning the game, which is frustrating. It only matters if we win though. I played pretty efficiently against Avon, and we won. I think that I missed one shot that game. I shot the ball well against Tabor, so that was a good performance. As a team, we played so much better than we had been. A lot of the time this year, we have been off and on rhythm wise. There are some games that I have been in rhythm and others when I have not. I need to be more consistent and play with a better throughout the entire game, not just bits and pieces of it.\n**What are your biggest strengths, not only as a player, but as a leader?**\nAs a point guard, I’m starting to do a better job of managing not only what I have to do, but manage everybody on the team. I have struggled with that this year at times, but I’m starting to get better at it. Being a leader, a lot of it is not how good I am [on the court], it’s more about the intangibles. Am I going to talk the most when no one else wants to talk? Communication is huge. I’m improving in that area. Being engaged in the game for the entire 48 minutes and not just being in it some of the time. My goal is to be engaged throughout the whole game.\n**Being an impact player, what steps have you taken to be even better this year than last?**\nWell, it all starts with my workouts at six in the morning. I go through basketball workouts before school a lot of days. Last year, we had a different team. We had a lot of guys who could score the ball. I would fill in wherever they needed me. I’ve really spent a lot of time in the gym working on my game. I’ve gotten a lot stronger and have done better at picking my spots: knowing when I can go and take over and when I can’t. Last year I struggled with timing. Sometimes, I would take ill-advised shots or become selfish. I didn’t always make the right plays for the team. Now I’m doing a better job at navigating between when to take the pedal off and let it come to me.\n**What are your goals for the team as a whole?**\nOur goal has always been to make the playoffs. If we make the playoffs, we feel that anything can happen. My personal goal for the team is to win a championship. I think that we can do that, and that it should never be waved off as something that we can’t accomplish. We have improved so much in the last three games. We are on the right track. We just need to start winning close games. That starts with me making the right amount of plays and making the right adjustments to close games.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nTransplanted from a low-income neighborhood in West Philadelphia, PA., to St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH., Lorene Cary struggled to overcome the prejudice that she encountered as a female, African-American student during the second year of coeducation at St. Paul’s. \n “Once, my English teacher exclaimed, ‘Class! Guess who wrote a high honors [essay]!’ You don’t say that unless you expect it to be a surprise, and the surprise was that the person who had come from public school had written a better paper than those who had been prepared by private school,” said Cary, a social activist and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, during her presentation in Kemper Auditorium last Friday.\n In her presentation, she shared her experience of race, class and gender first growing up in Philadelphia, then attending St. Paul’s. She also spoke about “Black Ice,” a memoir and reflection on her own time at St. Paul’s. \n “Coming to St. Paul’s gave me an extraordinary luxury. It was a glorious look at what fabulous education could look like. It was an American secret. I didn’t know it was possible. Writing this memoir gave me a chance that I needed to talk about that,” said Cary in her presentation.\n Cary, however, said that prejudices exist everywhere, including institutions like St. Paul’s, and her experience at the St. Paul’s was affected by her race, class and gender. \n “Coming to St. Paul’s, for example, meant I began to think about what my relationship to wealth was, and made me realize that I don’t want things, so much as I want the freedom,” said Cary in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Cary also emphasized in her presentation how the lessons can be ingrained not only into the minds of the students but also in their bodies. \n “When two teachers [in my public school] made boys stand in the back of the room and hold their arms out until their muscles failed, and then shamed them for it, all of us understood that we were being told we were not worthy of a full education,” said Cary.\n From these physically painful or uncomfortable experiences, Cary said that her body learned lessons about what she called the criteria for success for black people in America and strategies on how to counter negative expectations of her. \n “One of the criteria is that you have to make the ‘mainstream’ feel less nervous around you. You have to notice — and I noticed — when people thought that I was likely to be inferior… I had to figure out strategies. First, I would bury my own rage about the trivial expectations of me, then [I had] to become what was necessary to counter the impression,” said Cary.\n The challenges that Cary faced due to her race and class at St. Paul’s as well as within the Philadelphia public school system influenced her writing of “Black Ice” and inspired her to start participating in social activism.\n Cary said that the assassinations of prominent figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X and John F. Kennedy also influenced her to become a social activist in order to better a world riddled with injustice.\n “These were people I looked up to, and particularly Martin [Luther] King, [Jr.], who was coming up with ways to move us forward past social constructs that were once thought impenetrable. He was finding ways to do it and [it was crazy how] he could just be shot and done,” said Cary in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Cary is currently working on writing future books and launching a website which will publish weekly posts about what keeps kids safe, starting with urban kids in Philadelphia. The website is set to launch in September 2015.\n Cary’s visit was sponsored by the Community and Multicultural Development Office and funded by the Elizabeth Rogers Fund and the John H. Hosch Memorial Fund.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nRelentless effort from Sam Glazer ’15 and Eric Alperin ’15 brought Andover Boys Basketball to tight games against Milton, Tabor and Governor’s last week, but lost all three contests.\n Last Friday at Milton, a swish from Glazer cut the Milton lead to two in the waning minutes, but the strong comeback attempt was not enough as Andover fell 73-68.\n Robby Cerulle ’17 said, “We put good shots up and played well on defense, but their three-point shooting kept them ahead. We just couldn’t stop them.”\n Andover’s 68 points in the loss was its highest point tally of the season. Three Andover players put up double-digit scores: Glazer and Alperin had 15 and 14 respectively. Nick Forti ’15 put up 15.\n Andover faced Tabor at home on Saturday. The team pushed aside the loss from the previous day and entered the Tabor game with optimism. Electric play from guard Alperin, who made six of eight shots from three-point range, boosted the team.\n Kurtis Weber ’15 said, “This year, I like how we’ve played together as a team through hardship, under the great leadership of our top players Glazer and Alperin.”\n Cerulle added, “[Alperin] went off and really carried us with incredible three-point shooting.”\n While Alperin had a great shooting day, Andover struggled to contain Tabor’s big men in the paint as it played without starting power forward Jake Nelson ’15, who is nursing an ankle injury. Andover ultimately lost 59-53. \n “In my mind, both these games went well. We were good and we played hard. However, in these close games, we still could have much better effort and we really should have won them. Both were within our reach, but we just couldn’t pull it out. We need to dive for loose balls, rebound harder, and then I think we can pull out some wins,” said forward Taylor Beckett ’17.\n On Wednesday, Andover played Governor’s at home where threes from Alperin and Glazer helped the team out to a quick first-half lead.\n Struck with fatigue towards the end of the first half, the team called on Glazer to step up, and he delivered, scoring 17 points in the contest.\n The game came down to the final minute with Governor’s leading by three. Andover nearly pulled out the comeback when its press defense forced a turnover, but the team failed to recover the ball and get off a final shot. The game ended in a 54-51 loss.\n Andrew Reavis ’17 said, “We didn’t compete and we are, myself especially, playing like we don’t have any passion for what we are doing, and that has to be fixed for us to be successful.”\n Andover is now 2-10 on the season and will play against Deerfield this Saturday at home.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nWith one second left on the clock, shooting guard Emma Kelley ’17 crossed her defender and hit a jump shot from the left elbow to secure a 44-18 lead against Milton at halftime. Spurred by Kelley’s 20-point contribution, Andover Girls Basketball went on to earn a 70-46 victory in front of a packed crowd at home on Saturday. \n Andover entered the game roaring with energy and confidence after three consecutive wins. \n “We came in off a great win on Wednesday and wanted to continue our win streak, and it helped to have a lot of fans cheering us on,” said forward Courtney Erickson ’15.\n The team maintained control of the ball and secured a comfortable lead for the entire game, but Milton combated Andover’s momentum and emerged with a vengeance at the beginning of the second half.\n “In the second half, [Milton] came out pretty strong and played a tough man-to-man press, and we struggled to rebound well,” said Assistant Coach Christopher Jones.\n Kelley added, “We kind of thought we were going to have the second half in the bag, which didn’t end up happening, but we stayed ahead of them and were confident in the end that we were going to take the win.”\n Andover focused on mastering its full court 2-2-1 press to shut Milton out offensively. This, in turn, translated to Andover’s best offensive performance of the season. \n “The 2-2-1 press was much more efficient than in the Brewster game. We got a lot of steals off of it in the first half, and overall, it led us into a better 2-3 defense,” said Kelley.\n Jones added, “We played particularly well with our press, which allowed us to score a lot in the first half.”\n Andover greatly reduced its number of turnovers by making smarter passes.\n “We didn’t turn the ball over very much compared to other games, so that was really crucial,” said Jones.\n On Wednesday, Andover’s four game winning streak fell short by a single point to Thayer at 39-38, bringing its record to 4-6.\n The team struggled to match Thayer’s deluge of three-point baskets in the first half because of slow switches between the guards and forwards in the 2-3 zone defense. \n “Our switches were slow around the perimeter of the defense. 18 of their 24 points in the first half were three-pointers, so that speaks to how much they beat us behind the arc,” said guard Gadson Lefft ’15.\n “We didn’t get as many steals off of our press as we did against Milton,” added point guard Sarah Humes ’16.\n Ultimately, Andover shifted to a man-to-man defense in the second half to combat Thayer’s offense.\n “The man-to-man defense helped shut them down a lot. We were faster to the ball and always made sure that someone was guarding their shooters,” said Humes.\n On offense, Andover struggled to find the basket and scored fewer three-point baskets relative to its other performances this season.\n Lefft said, “We took good shots, but they just didn’t fall like usual.”\n Andover entered the game low on energy, which contributed to its sluggish start.\n “We came out slow and didn’t bring a lot of intensity,” said Lefft.\n Laura Bilal ’17 added, “We lacked energy on defense and couldn’t find our rhythm as a team.”\n Despite the close loss, Andover remains positive and is determined to win its game against Deerfield on Saturday.\n “We are going to use it as motivation and come out strong,” said Bilal.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nOn Wednesday at 6:15 p.m., Head of School John Palfrey raised his iconic blue squash racquet above the crowd in Lower Right of Paresky Commons.\n Head of School Day is an annual event in Winter Term in which students get a day to rest and catch up on work in the midst of a hectic week. It has been a tradition since 1991, after an overflow of students in Isham led Head of School Donald McNemar, who served as Head from 1981 to 1994, to cancel classes, so students could enjoy a day for “health and recovery.”\n “I decide Head of School Day mostly based on gut feel,” said Palfrey in an email to The Phillipian. “When do our beloved students need that unexpected break most?”\n This year’s Head of School Day will push Thursday’s class schedule to Friday. All classes and sports will be canceled, with the exception of Boys Varsity Hockey, Boys Varsity Squash and Boys Junior Varsity Two Squash.\n The timing of the day has always been purposefully ambiguous and at the discretion of the Head of School.

The distance running duo of Gorton and Ralph Skinner ’16 claimed second and third place behind an Andover High runner in the Two-Mile. Skinner finished with a time of 10.54.32.\n Although this meet was Andover Boys Track’s first loss of the season, the team remains optimistic and eager to improve. \n Gorton said, “You can’t win these things every time. It feels great to win, but what really gets a team fired up and excited about improvement are those times when it doesn’t go 100 percent your way.

They don’t really think about it. They don’t process it like adults. They don’t have that kind of situation where they’re getting nervous in quite the same way.… They’re not set in their ways so much; they can sometimes respond in performance.”\n In addition to the choir, the concert also featured ninth-grader and St. Paul’s Choir alumnus Forrest Eimold, a talented organist. He played a piece entitled “Livre du Saint Sacrement: XIII. Les deux murailles d’eau,” or “The Two Walls of Water,” by Olivier Messian, a contemporary French composer. \n The piece began with a series of loud, dissonant chords that ascended and descended through consecutive notes. These jarring yet flowing movements mimicked the sound of a waterfall, true to the title of the piece.\n “[Eimold] is fantastic.… Normally people in college [or] graduate school would be playing pieces of that caliber, and he’s in ninth grade. He’s very mature in his ability to interpret really complex music,” said Dr. Abbey Siegfried, Organist and Instructor in Music.\n The singers concluded the program with “A Song of Wisdom” by Charles Villiers Stanford. Light organ accompaniment introduced the melody while the boys sang softly. Later, the piece sped up and increased dramatically in volume and energy, transforming into a march that exhibited the singers’ vocal range and ability to transition between high and low notes. \n “[A Song of Wisdom] was kind of inspiring in a way. The song and how the choir sounded just awoke some emotions in me,” said audience member Lara Guvelioglu ’16. “The song’s rhythm was very inspiring and hopeful.… I felt a good kind of sadness, bliss, determination and hope.”\n After the concert, Robinson hosted a workshop for interested students, teaching them how to read a Gregorian chant called “Dominica II.

It was really cool, and you saw the freedom that came once you reached that level,” said Michaela Barczak ’15, who participated in the workshop. \n The concert was funded by an Abbot Academy Association grant that was initiated by Tom Burnett ’15. \n “I graduated from the St. Paul’s Choir School in 2011, and it was a really big part of my childhood, a big part of who I am and really important to me. I wanted to share that with the Andover community.

Kang held the key in the air slightly above the table and asked Alice Lu ’17 to shine a flashlight on the key so that Kang could trace its shadow onto the paper.\n Kang’s sketch was part of the “Collaborative Mural” activity at addiSUNDAY, an event last Sunday afternoon at the Addison Gallery of American Art. addiSUNDAY included three art activities inspired by the Addison’s new exhibit, “Light/Dark, White/Black,” which features works of art in shades of black and white. The event was planned and hosted by the Addison Community Ambassadors, a group of students who work with the Addison’s education department to learn more about the museum and brainstorm activities for Addison visitors.\n “Earlier in the fall, our Addison Community Ambassadors were talking about how they wanted a day of activities in the galleries for [Andover] students. The Addison Community Ambassadors were talking about what a good de\xadstresser it is to just do hands on art-making stuff, and they wanted for [Andover] students to have that same chance to play with materials and have it be non-stressful – no art experience required,” said Jamie Kaplowitz, Education Associate and Museum Learning Specialist at the Addison.\n In “Naming Black and White,” another activity at addiSUNDAY, students scrutinized an assortment of paint samples in various shades of black and white in order to name the samples as if they were a paint company. Some of the responses included “burnt toast,” “meringue on a bright yellow lemon pie” and “needs-a-fresh-coat white.”\n Claire Park ’16, an Addison Community Ambassador, said, “The ‘Naming Black and White’ activity was intended for visitors to interpret the artwork linguistically — through renaming shades of white and black. It was a way for them to take personal ownership of a nuance that they captured and write down for others to see and recognize… Since people were bound to both disagree and agree with each other, the sharing portion of the activity was intended to encourage the usage of other interpretations as launching points for one’s own.”\n The third activity was titled “Black and White Collage.” Visitors were invited to cut, layer and glue pieces of black, white and gray paper together to make collages. The limited color palette encouraged students to think about texture and patterns in their collages.\n “The aim of the activity was for students to get away from the idea that black and white are two, unchanging things. It got students to layer shades of black and white materials to create depth and convey messages and themes,” said Lu, an Addison Community Ambassador. “I saw a few of the collages before I left, and I loved the use of texture and shade. There was one collage that from far away looked like a blank, white box. However, as one got closer, one could see that there were in fact letters cut out of white packaging foam.”\n Harriet Chiu ’15, who attended addiSUNDAY, said “I mainly come to [addiSUNDAY] for a break. [The Addison] has such a different atmosphere from the rest of the school. It’s nice to get away from everything else that is going on.”\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nSeeing images of American politicians on television, Kailash Sundaram ’15, an Indian American, wondered why so few of them looked like himself. \n Indian Americans, although they comprise around one percent of the American population, lack involvement in United States politics, said Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar Sundaram in his presentation “The Fight to be American: Indian-American Political Activism” on Monday in Kemper Auditorium.\n Sundaram this is primarily due to a lack of recognition that Indian-Americans are American. \n Since the advent of mass Indian immigration into the United States, Indian-American political progress has been hindered by the perpetual foreigner syndrome. In reaction to this, Indian Americans have struggled to be recognized as true Americans. In his presentation, Sundaram explored the history of this Indian-American activism in five stages, starting from the 1900s to present day America.\n Sundaram said Punjabi Sikh British men travelled to America to work in lumber mills at the start of the 20th century, becoming the first Indian immigrants in America. They brought a new and distinct look to America by wearing their turbans and manifesting their religion. The newcomers faced racism and prejudice in response to both their culture and the threat they posed against white, middle-class American men for jobs, Sundaram said.\n Indians in America soon evolved to find themselves more American and decided to fight for their citizenship. Through lobbying, Indian Americans worked to pass the Luce-Celler Act of 1946, which allowed them to be naturalized as citizens. \n In the 1960s, following the Immigration Act of 1965, a large number of well-educated Indians immigrated to America. The Indian-Americans, soon attaining what they considered the American Dream of economic and social success, were relegated to model minority status.\n “The problem remains; Indian Americans were laborers and not leaders. Indian Americans have never fought a serious political struggle, and they believed in working with the system they’ve found,” Sundaram said. \n To be considered by the general populace as more American, Indian Americans began to separate themselves from their Indian identities and promote their American ones.\n “Is there a need for successful Indian Americans in politics to assimilate and hide their characters? Probably,” Sundaram said.\n To combat the lack of Indian-American political power, Sundaram said that a fight against the negative media portrayals of Indian Americans would discourage the idea that Indian Americans are not truly American.\n “As America moves forward, immigrants should not be thought of as hyphenated Americans but, rather, as one single entity — American,” Sundaram said.\n Two guest speakers, Sonali Lappin and Saatvik Ahluwalia, whom Sundaram chose himself, presented afterwards on the importance of racial diversity in politics.\n Lappin, the vice president of the Indian American Forum for Political Education, supported Sundaram’s idea that Indian Americans’ lack of political representation is due to their lack of recognition as Americans and added that the process of legislation and lobbying is often confusing and convoluted. \n Ahluwalia, a Boston native who ran for the Lexington, Mass., board of selectmen, presented his perspective as an Indian American running for a political position. \n Sundaram believes that the topic of activism can apply to on-campus clubs, especially those representing the minority groups. \n “[Andover students] can be civically engaged. When they see people of color, they can not think of them as different from themselves. We’re all in this together,” Sundaram said during an interview with The Phillipian.\n “My hope is that someday people from [immigrant] communities can be recognized as Americans,” said Sundaram.\n “I thought [Sundaram] did a great job of giving us the historical context, so we can understand the roots of the lack of Indian-American political activity right now. I thought he did a great job with the visuals too,” said Theodore Parker, Instructor in History and Sundaram’s faculty advisor.\n “The best part [of working] with [Sundaram was how he] proved his independence and his ability to take feedback and incorporate that not only in his research but in his writing as well,” continued Parker.\n Sundaram’s presentation was third of a series of CAMD Scholar presentations this year.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nOver the last year, many significant world events have resulted in intense global discussion and debate: the annexation of Crimea by Russia, the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions, Boko Haram’s presence in Nigeria, the rise of Islamic State, Occupy Central, the reemergence of Ebola and, more recently, the attacks in Paris. Recently, the Senior Administrative Council (SAC) has asked how should the school, faculty and administration should respond to such events. \n The SAC held an open discussion last Monday on the school’s responsibility to respond to major world events. The meeting, not intended to produce any resolutions, focused instead on trading ideas between members of the administration about how the school can deal with these controversial happenings. \n According to “The Andover Gazette,” “The SAC discussed the challenge of properly recognizing significant events that are occurring not only locally but also around the nation and the world. We strive to be responsive to the requests and needs of students as they learn about and grapple with ongoing national and international news.”\n Generally, the school has no typical response for major world event, and each event is talked about on a case-by-case basis. A number of factors affect the level of involvement the school has in facilitating discussion on campus, said Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life. \n “Sometimes, it’s the Head of School writing. Sometimes, there could be a student protest or a student-initiated thing. If Ferguson had happened while we were here, I’m sure there would have a been a student event of some sort,” Murphy said.\n One of these world events — the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson by police — sparked nationwide protests against the failure of a grand jury to indict the officer involved.\n On account of the shooting, Head of School John Palfrey, Murphy and Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, wrote a school-wide email addressing the situation on November 26.\n “It was affecting the faculty quite a lot, and the students started writing to the faculty… It just felt like the right thing to do,” said Murphy.\n This type of response realistically will not be able to happen each time something happens, Murphy said. The school has many options for corresponding with the students and facilitating discussion, but a large part of their decision is based on the context and timing of the controversial event in relation to other world news. \n “A number of years ago when we had a lot of natural disasters that happened, when the first one happened, we did a big fundraiser, and we sent money. Then, the next one happened, and there was fatigue about the event. [Students and faculty were thinking,] ‘I can’t care about all these things on the same level,’” said Murphy.\n In the past few weeks, two other major international events have transpired, seemingly without much fanfare among the administration. Although the massacre in Nigeria by Boko Haram and the attacks on Charlie Hebdo have roused much debate worldwide, the school did not take a stance on the events or send emails to the student body to promote discussion.\n “You know, we aren’t a political body. People aren’t watching to see what our reaction to so and so is. On the flip side, when there are world events that are applicable to the learning environment, we should reach out the students, because they will reach out to us anyways,” Murphy said.\n Another major factor in their decision process is the relevance of events to the student body, said Murphy. \n With Charlie Hebdo, there was not as much of a response as there had been for the situation in Ferguson. The reason for that might have been simply that, since Brown was a student, his story was more relatable to the student body, said Murphy.\n “[The Charlie Hebdo attack] may feel like just another terrorist attack, and that’s an adult thing, not a kid thing, whereas Ferguson involved a kid, a young person, and it was a different topic. It’s a police officer doing something versus a terrorist doing something,” said Murphy.\n The SAC consists of Stephen Carter, Patrick Farrell, Linda Griffith, Sean Logan, Thom Lockerby, Paul Murphy ’84, John Palfrey, Patricia Russell, Rachel Skiffer, Tracy Sweet and Jim Ventre ’79.\n\n', 'Jan 22, 2015'), ('\nFrank Tipton, Dean of West Quad North Cluster, Jennifer Elliott, Dean of Abbot Cluster, and Raj Mundra, Dean of Pine Knoll Cluster, will all be leaving their positions at the end of this school year, prompting a search for three new Cluster Deans.\nThe candidates for the three vacant Cluster Dean positions are as follows:\nChris Capano:\n_Director of Student Activities, House Counselor in Burtt House, Started at Andover in 2000_\nDebbie Chase:\n_Instructor in English, House Counselor in Hearsey House, Started at Andover in 2007_\nBrian Faulk ’00:\n_Instructor in Chemistry, House Counselor in Taylor Hall, Started at Andover in 2006_\nMartha Fenton ’83:\n_Instructor in Athletics, House Counselor in Johnson Hall, Started at Andover in 1994_\nDavid Gardner:\n_Instructor in English, House Counselor in Draper Cottage, Started at Andover in 2013_\nDale Hurley:\n_Instructor in Mathematics, House Counselor in Pease House, Started at Andover in 2006_\nTheodore Parker:\n_Instructor in History, House Counselor in Samaritan House, Started at Andover in 2012_\nWill Orben:\n_Instructor in Mathematics, Former House Counselor in Taylor Hall, currently lives in Paul Revere Hall, Started at Andover in 2013_\nElliott and Mundra will become Dean of Students and Associate Dean of Students respectively beginning this July.\nTipton will leave Andover to assume the position Assistant Head of School of Gann Academy in Waltham, Mass.\n\n', 'Jan 21, 2015'), ('\nOn Wednesday, January 21 at 6:15 pm, Head of School John Palfrey raised his iconic blue squash racquet above the crowd in Lower Right of Paresky Commons.\nHead of School Day is an annual event in winter term in which students get a day to rest and catch up on work in the midst of a hectic week.

By the end of the day, students and faculty had joined Gittens in protesting Andover’s lack of recognition of MLK Day.\nThanks to Gittens’s bravery and perseverance, Andover has since cancelled class on MLK Day in favor of organizing workshops for the student body. This year, instead of relaxing in bed like the majority of high school students across the nation, Andover students will engage in discussion on gender, race, class and sexuality, as well as welcome Gittens back to campus as the keynote speaker at Monday’s All-School Meeting (ASM).\n“[Gittens] was chosen because [this year is] the 25th anniversary. The timing, though, has been a phenomenon. [Given] the fact that Ferguson had occurred and Garner and there is so much talk about activism… I thought [it was] a perfect time to bring back Dr. Gittens,” said Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development.\nGittens will reflect on the motivations that drove him to protest the school’s not acknowledging MLK Day, as well as discuss the importance of developing a personal value system.\n“I think what you are going to learn from Dr. Gittens is that what might motivate one individual is not the same thing that might motivate another individual… There were many other black students on campus, [but] no one else led the boycott,” said Griffith.\n“He had to because of his history: who he was where he grew up. Dr. King meant something to him, and the holiday meant something to him. My hope is that individuals are going to hear that,” she continued.\nFollowing the ASM, students will attend various workshops chosen by the student- and faculty-led MLK Jr. Day Planning Committee.\nWhile Juniors will attend a workshop featuring performances from “Out of the Blue,” Lowers will attend a presentation on the events in Ferguson, MO., by David Canton, an Associate Professor of History at Connecticut College. Canton visited campus in December to discuss the events in Ferguson. Since most Lowers did not attend his talk in December, he will present similar materials to the previous one, Griffith said.\nGriffith said that the Uppers and Seniors were given the option to choose from a wide variety of topics, as they have a deeper understanding of race and the history behind it.\nMeanwhile, Debby Irving, the author of “Waking Up White and Finding Myself in the Story of Race,” will host a faculty and staff only workshop to discuss her book.\n“[Others and I] had read her book this summer, and we felt as though the conversation about race should never be one-sided… When we talk about race, people think it’s about the non-white people. [But] white people are as much a part of a conversation about race as anybody else. So I was very excited about her book, which is a personal memoir, but which really talks about her own awakening,” said Griffith.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n', 'Jan 17, 2015'), ('\nAfter suffering a severe injury in a water polo game, a Senior is now legally blind in his left eye. Facing five courses’ worth of homework, tests and papers, he often finds himself dizzy and nauseous when he exceeds his safe 30-minute period of focus. \n “This physical disability has had profound impact on me in the classroom. Now, reading or simply focusing on homework assignments have become difficult, and I need to make sure that I am sleeping and getting the rest I need,” he said. \n Andover currently accommodates 22 students with physical or medical disabilities. According to Patricia Davison, Coordinator of Student Disabilities, there are two main kinds of physical disability: acute, temporary impairments, and chronic, long term impairments. Acute impairments include injuries such as broken limbs, while chronic impairments can include disabilities such as deafness or blindness.\n “We work…with the students on a case by case basis. Students with long standing chronic impairments, such as somebody who is confined to a wheelchair or somebody who lacks a hand, require ongoing accommodations. The most important thing is finding accommodations that are designed to work for that student,” said Davison in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Each type of disability has its own accommodations of various time spans and natures, and accommodations last the length of the impairment. The amount of students receiving accommodations fluctuates every day, but as of January 15, Andover accommodates 14 students with disclosed chronic medical disabilities, 7 students with disclosed temporary physical disabilities and 1 student with a disclosed chronic physical disability. \n “With such an expansive campus, it was quite a challenge getting around on crutches. Elevators tend to be difficult to access and the campus isn’t really built for people with mobility issues,” Harper North ’16, who had foot surgery earlier this year. \n On campus, six of 40 dorms are wheelchair accessible: Adams Hall, Bartlet Hall, Isham, Paul Revere Hall, Rockwell House and E.H. Stuart House. Additionally, there are seven academic buildings that are accessible: Bulfinch Hall, Gelb Science Center, Graves Hall, OWH Library, Morse Hall, the Ice Arena and the Smith Center. Three buildings, Borden and Memorial Gym, Samuel Phillips Hall and Pearson Hall, are partially accessible.\n As a result of back injuries, Carrie Ingerman ’15 receives accommodations from the school so that she does not have to carry all her textbooks to every class.\n “I particularly have struggled with the expectation to carry around big, heavy textbooks to all of my classes. After my back surgeries, I had a 5-pound weight limit. I was allowed to keep a book in the classroom that I was able to have access to. Even now, I still have that accommodation because I cannot carry heavy objects,” said Ingerman.\n Although Andover tries to accommodate students as well as possible, Davison said that there are limitations to the accommodation program. \n “There are reasonable accommodations, and the operative word is ‘reasonable.’ There is nothing we are going to be able to do about the fact that it is five hundred acre plus campus, in New England, on a hill, with a major road way in between. There are things about this campus that make it very difficult if you’re not able bodied,” said Davison.\n Andover has also looked to technology to help accommodate students with disabilities. \n “Taking tests with written expressions in mathematics is important, and you can’t really answer questions orally in Math. There is software like Goodnotes, which is an application for the iPad that allows a student with a stylus to write very easily with the non dominant hand,” said Davison.\n In cases of more complicated disabilities, Andover hopes to continue use technology to help accommodate students. Davison pointed specifically to the Kurzweil Machine, a machine capable of scanning books and converting them from text to speech. According to Davison, it would be helpful for a large range of students, from those that are blind to those affected by dyslexia.\n Andover took a leading role in accommodating students with physical disabilities since the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In 2001, Andover founded its Student Disability Services department, and was, according to Davison, the “first of like schools to do so.”\n Students with physical disabilities at Andover face a particularly hard challenge keeping up with the pace of life, according to Davison.\n “It’s really hard if you have any kind of a physical limitation to keep up around here. If you’re able minded, able bodied, completely intact in all ways, it’s still very challenging. So then just add to that some pretty significant load and it’s just like taking seven classes,” said Davison.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nDanny Shleifer ’15 has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but he does not consider it a cognitive disability. \n “Andover has been pretty helpful about ADHD and tried its best to support me, but at the end of the day, a big part of what a good school does is help kids with different learning styles learn in the best way for them, and I think I just fall under that category,” he said. \n Forty-six Andover students diagnosed with cognitive disabilities, such as ADHD and dyslexia, currently receive assistance from Andover, said Patricia Davison, Coordinator of Student Disabilities.\n “There aren’t too many positions beyond Andover where you will need to have rapid, instant, thoughtful and spot-on answers. Andover sometimes works at such an unrelenting pace that someone with a slightly slower processing speed — not less intelligent — might need accommodations,” said Davison.\n Andover provides accommodations such as extra time on timed assignments such as tests or having teachers deliberately wait a few seconds before calling on someone in class. The maximum amount of extra time a teacher is permitted to issue for in-class assessments is one-and-a-half times more than what is normally allowed. \n “One of the most fundamental principles behind my work is making sure that I am giving people equal access to the playing field. I am not trying to advantage students with cognitive disabilities and hopefully, I’m not disadvantaging them. The lens through which we look at each student is equity and whether or not we’re making the playing field equal,” said Davison.\n Students with cognitive disabilities do not receive extra time outside the classroom with homework assignments, said Davison. They are expected to manage their time appropriately such that they can turn in daily assignments, as well as long-term papers, on time. \n “If someone were disabled in a lot of other ways, this would be a really tough school for them to manage. If somebody was a quadriplegic, for example, we would not discriminate against them, but you’d have to think about how feasible and practical it would be to have them going around campus on an icy day in January,” said Davison. \n “If you do the math… doing everything 50 percent slower is about the slowest someone could go and still manage at Andover. If, for example, a student took two times as long to do everything, he or she probably couldn’t manage five classes and a sport and all the homework,” she continued.\n The 46 students who receive special assistance are not the only students at Andover with learning disabilities, but they are the only ones who have disclosed their disability to the school.\n “A student could have ADHD and take medication for it, and the medication mitigates the symptoms, so they don’t need to tell anyone about it and they don’t need additional accommodations from the school,” said Davison.\n Accommodations for cognitive disabilities are evaluated on a case by case basis. For example, a student who receives extra time in math class will not necessarily receive accommodations in English class. A student’s cognitive disability is recognized by the school and by Davison through a series of tests, which occur after the student has disclosed his or her disability to the school.. After receiving recognition from the school, everyone on the student’s “team” is notified, and Davison will recommend appropriate accommodations to each team member. A student’s team consists of teachers, coaches and house counselors.\n Davison sometimes works in conjunction with Isham and Graham House to help a student in other aspects of his or her daily life.\n “There is often crossover between a cognitive disability and needing emotional or physical support,” said Davison.\n “Sometimes our office, [Isham and Graham House] work in triangulation to provide a student the necessary help.”\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nJames Towne ’15 will pit his debate skills against internationally-acclaimed speakers in the World Individual Debating & Public Speaking Championship in Hong Kong this April.\n Towne qualified for the tournament by winning third place in Advanced Speaker at The Hotchkiss School Parliamentary Extemporaneous Debate Competition last Sunday.

The 30 Under 30 list is comprised of 600 young “game-changers, movers and makers” under 30 years old in 20 different fields, including sports, finance, music and healthcare, according to the magazine’s website.\n**Krishna Gupta ’05**\nInstead of interning for a big venture capital firm while studying for his undergraduate degree at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Krishna Gupta ’05 started his own venture capital firm, Romulus Capital, from his dorm room in 2008.\nRomulus Capital has since expanded, and Gupta, Founder and General Partner, now leads a team of nine associates to invest in early-stage companies that specialize in innovative science and technology.\n“I just wanted to build a foundation of interesting businesses. I stumbled onto the idea in the sense that there was a clear need in the market. Large venture firms were really betting instead of building, and the angel investors, who are individuals investing in companies, were just kind of doing it as a hobby or not adding specific values,” said Gupta.\nGupta cites influences from Andover, especially time spent at the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology, on his work as a venture capitalist.\n“I think a lot of the fundamentals that I’ve learned at Andover continue to apply. My interest has always been to build something that will stand the test of time and will be around when I’m gone,” said Gupta.\n“I’m a big fan of history and archeology,” he continued. “It’s always great to look at artifacts and see things that played a role thousands of thousands of years ago, if not longer, and see how civilizations came up and stayed for a long time. I think all of that plays into the foundational ‘DNA’ of Romulus.”\nAccording to Gupta, Andover also helped him develop his love for the humanities. He had always been passionate about history, math and science, even taking chemistry every trimester of his four-year Andover career, but his most memorable class was the English class he took his Lower year.\n“I would say that [Lower year] was the time when I really figured out who I was. I really felt that I did some introspection and read a lot of philosophical works. It really allowed me to explore myself. I would say from that point on, I haven’t really changed in terms of my thinking and outlook on the world,” said Gupta.\nRomulus Capital helped raise $13.5 million for E la Carte, a company that develops tableside tablets for food and hospitality industries last year. After raising $1 million for the firm’s first fund in 2009, Romulus Capital closed its second fund of $50 million last May with the help of investors from all over the world. Gupta plans to invest in 20 to 25 new businesses with this fund.\n**Abigail Seldin ’05**\nConfused and overwhelmed college applicants no longer have to navigate the labyrinth of different kinds of financial aid for various potential schools on their own, thanks to College Abacus. Designed by Abigail Seldin ’05, College Abacus is a free online tool that allows users to calculate their projected financial aid and compare it to that of other colleges and universities.\nSeldin realized the need to simplify the process of determining financial aid when her mother-in-law, president of Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, described the complicated and stressful process that many families have to undergo when calculating the price of a college education.\n“These days you can comparison-shop for just about anything online, from plane tickets to hotel rooms. With something as expensive as college, you should be able to compare prices. Given the size of many financial aid packages, students need to access college-supported estimates when evaluating the cost of different college options,” wrote Seldin in an email to The Phillipian.\nUnlike other sites, College Abacus generates the same estimates for an individual school that would appear on that school’s website. Other calculators have their own algorithms that do not match the colleges’ own prices.\n“To make a difference in any field, you first need to identify the problem you want to solve. Find a problem that matters to you, research current approaches and create new ways to improve the situation. In starting College Abacus, the problem I addressed was the opacity of the college financial aid system,” said Seldin.\nDuring her time at Andover, Seldin graduated “cum laude,” curated the “Pecos Pueblo: Crossroads of Culture” exhibit at the Peabody Museum as an independent project and spent the majority of her free time working as a producer in the Theatre Department.\n“At Andover, I acquired many skills [including] historical research, showering in sandals [and] stage-management, but personal discipline and ‘Non Sibi’ stand out as the most important lessons,” Seldin said.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nRajesh Mundra, Dean of Pine Knoll Cluster and Instructor in Biology, will assume the role of Associate Dean of Students starting in the 2015-2016 school year.

The commercial, which was met with sharp criticism in countless racist and hateful online messages, provided a basis for students to reflect on reasons why so many people had been affronted by the appearance of a mixed-race family on television during Sunday’s forum.\n The forum was held by MOSAIC, a campus affinity group for students who identify as mixed heritage, biracial, multicultural or multiethnic. \n “One thing that I learned at [David] Canton’s talk [in December] was that a large majority of white people aren’t friends with or have never met a black person. And so I feel like the commercial of a really well-known brand like Cheerios really shook those people in that majority,” said Ashley Scott ’16, who participated in the event. \n Students considered how reactions to the video would have differed if the mother were black and the father white, as well as the history of black men being stereotyped as predatory toward white women. \n The group also viewed a second Cheerios commercial, which featured a gay couple and their adopted black daughter but did not receive such an unfavorable response. Some students in the audience asked where the distinction lay and why such different reactions occurred, but ultimately did not arrive at a conclusion. \n Nicole Navarrete ’15, a board member of MOSAIC, said that it is necessary for students of all different identities to partake in the discussion of why the appearance of a mixed family in a Cheerios advertisement can still spark so much anger. \n The audience commended Cheerios for its commitment to reflecting a progressive and diverse America.\n “[The discussion was open to the public] because it was meant to be an eye-opening experience for some of the issues that we as mixed-heritage students face on a day-to-day basis. From these commercials, the overall idea that Cheerios is trying to give [is] that all that really matters in a family is love,” said Navarrete. \n “It’s really important to show [to those who are not mixed race] how important it is for students of mixed race to have a safe space and to be able to have these conversations,” she continued. \n The Cheerios discussion was preceded by a screening of the film “Little White Lie” on Friday night in Kemper Auditorium as part of MOSAIC’s Mixed-Heritage Awareness Week.\n “We tried to find something that was current and interesting. In last year’s screening, we showed ‘The Loving Story,’ which was a historical documentary, much like this one was, which was based on the history of mixed race marriages in this country,” said Aya Murata, Faculty Advisor to MOSAIC. \n “Little White Lie” explores themes of racial identity.\n The group decided to begin the week with a film because it is often a user-friendly way to introduce a topic or a conversation to a broader audience, Murata said.\n Mixed-Heritage Awareness Week concluded on Thursday with a special dinner hosted by MOSAIC in Paresky Commons, featuring multicultural and multiethnic food.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nRandy Pierce climbed all 48 peaks of the White Mountains in New Hampshire twice in two years. He is the first blind hiker to complete this foreboding task and will speak at Andover in January in a talk hosted by the Disability Rights, Education, Activism and Mentoring (DREAM) club. \n DREAM, a student-run organization created last spring, seeks to raise awareness about mental and physical disabilities at Andover by inviting speakers such as Pierce. The club aims to eliminate negative connotations surrounding the word “disability” on campus, said Carrie Ingerman ’15, President of DREAM. \n Ingerman founded the organization last spring, in reaction to the lack of ableism discussions in the midst of pervasive campus conversations about forms of identity such as race and gender.\n “I saw a need on campus for awareness about disabilities and ableism. ‘Out of the Blue’ had disabilities as a section, but we hadn’t talked about [them], so what I was hoping to do was bring awareness and discussion around the issue,” said Ingerman in an interview with The Phillipian.\n “Students, in general, don’t understand what disabilities are, especially learning disabilities. [They] think it’s unfair that another student gets extra time, or they think, ‘They’re stupid.’ There’s a negative connotation with disabilities,” she continued. \n As an organization, DREAM hopes to debunk these stereotypes through events such as No Shame in the Name (NSITN), a week-long celebration of mental and physical disabilities. Last May’s NSITN featured various events to promote discussion of ableism.\n “We share stories from individuals with disabilities. We show films that either are about the person with a disability or feature a person with disability. We also try to explain able bodied privilege as well as neurotic privilege,” wrote Ingerman in an email to The Phillipian.\n The organization is currently focusing on reforming school policies that assist students whose students whose disabilities require certain accommodations, such as extended time on examinations. While the policies attempt to guarantee equal treatment and protection of disabled students, she feels that they are problematic because teachers often lack the education necessary to properly abide by them. She hopes that her endeavors through DREAM will mobilize teachers to be more active in creating a supportive community.\n “Teachers either give too much time or too little time, making scheduling extended time or other time accommodations more difficult. I’ve had a few students who have dyslexia tell me that teachers, in the middle of class, will say, ‘Oops! Sorry, I had a dyslexic moment.’ Those types of comments are extremely offensive and hurtful. By raising awareness, I hope to stop that behavior and create a better support and a better community for students with disabilities,” said Ingerman.\n “It doesn’t matter how much money you have or what religion you are, you can have a disability. I think it’s really important that we celebrate it as a form of identity, especially since we are a community that values diversity,” she continued.\n During its weekly club meetings, DREAM holds discussions on topics including building accessibility and disability pride. \n “For a meeting about companies [that sell assistive devices], we hosted James Tilghman ’89, whose company, Granny Jo Products, sells additive devices that cater to individuals with physical disabilities,” said Ingerman.\n Pierce will be a part of the upcoming NSITN celebration. His non-profit organization, 2020 Vision Quest, serves to inspire others to overcome adversity, educate communities about blindness and raise money for the New Hampshire Association for the Blind and Guiding Eyes for the Blind, two charities that support visually impaired individuals.\n Ingerman will also present her CAMD Scholar paper, entitled “Educational Rights of Students with Disabilities: An Analysis of the Past, Present and Future of Overcoming Ableism in Independent New England Boarding Schools,” during this January’s NSITN. DREAM will host additional events such as an ice cream social and a movie showing to gather allies of those with disabilities in a relaxed and comfortable setting to discuss the issue and how to go about solving it.\n “I want attention on this issue. I want people to be aware. I want people to start talking about it. We are young, healthy adolescents now, but many people end up having a disability by the end of their lives. For individuals who have a disability earlier in their lives, we should support them, just as we would want to be supported when we’re old and need help in ways that we don’t currently know,” said Ingerman.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nDiners in Paresky Commons on Tuesday night witnessed a peculiar sight: many students sitting in the dining hall had placed their phones in little baskets on every table. \n Student Council announced the placement of small baskets for cellphones on Commons tables to promote technology-free meals last Tuesday in an email to the Andover community.\n Student Council believes that cellphones have taken over a significant portion of student life on campus, preventing the growth of meaningful student relationships, and often serving as distractions. \n “In our lives, we waste too much time on our phones. It prevents us from talking to people. I hate how [when] you’re walking on the path, and it’s you and one other person, alone at a random hour… you’ll wait and see if you make eye contact with the person, and 80 percent of the time, they grab their phones and look down,” said Rebecca Somer ’15, Student Body Co-President.\n In an email to the student body, Student Council members wrote, “Our mealtimes are some of the few moments we have an opportunity to truly let go of our work and unwind.

Part of the Organic Turf Pilot Program established by Andover’s Sustainability Office and planned to be completed this spring, the initiation will aid research for a more sustainable method of maintenance for Andover’s lawns. \n Using organic chemistry to determine the specific needs of Abbot’s soil in order to produce specialized compost for optimum health of the lawn, the pilot program may provide a more environmentally-friendly solution that is less costly than current methods of grass maintenance, said Paul Wolff, Sustainability Coordinator. The current grass at Andover is not sustainable and requires considerable resources for maintenance. \n “Organic turf care allows the lawn to grow deeper roots, to have fewer weeds and requires less water and maintenance,” Wolff wrote in an email to The Phillipian. “The integration of soil chemistry creates a healthier ecosystem and reduces the impacts of our landscaping operations.”\n The compost is entirely organic and provides little risk of environmental harm, said Wolff. He and Russell Stott, Grounds Manager, are leading the efforts in conjunction with PJC Organics, a Massachusetts based family-run company specializing in environmentally-friendly lawn solutions. \n At the end of the pilot program, the Sustainability Office will present the data collected to the community and the Board of Trustees. In presenting its report, the Sustainability Office will consider the cost, aesthetics and viability of the project’s implementation on a larger scale. \n “If all goes as we hope, we would like to look towards implementing the program campus-wide,” said Wolff. “In the long term, we hope to be one of the first of our peer institutions to implement a system of sustainable turf across many acres of manicured lawns.” \n The vastness of campus and numerous lawns pose a challenge for implementing the system on a large scale. Each lawn will likely need its own specialized compost to meet its specific needs. \n The Abbot Campus, specifically the lawn in front of Draper Hall, was chosen for the project because the smaller area is manageable to monitor and assess in great detail. \n “Another benefit of Abbot is that it isn’t right in the middle of campus,” said Wolff. “If the project does not meet expectations, it won’t be as out in the open.” \n On the ultimate goal of the program, Wolff said, “We want to improve landscaping and introduce a brand new way of thinking about the lawns.”\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\nCynthia Eaton Bing AA ’61, Trustee Emerita, peacefully passed away on Friday, December 12, 2014, after a long illness.\n After graduating from Abbot Academy, Bing contributed to the Andover community in multiple ways. She served as an Alumni Council member from 1982-1986, Alumni Council President from 1984-1986, Alumni Trustee and Class Agent. Much of Bing’s volunteer work for Andover helped foster a strong sense of community for generations of Abbot graduates. She often organized and hosted luncheons in New York City for Abbot alumnae of all ages.\n “People like [Bing] are particularly vital for Abbot women because when we first started these Abbot gatherings … there wasn’t much emphasis on Abbot. The fact that we got the community together here in New York City was a way of saying ‘Hey, our school is gone but we’re still a part of Andover.’ I think that was really good for keeping the Abbot lifeline going,” said Marcia McCabe AA ’73.\n Bing worked to keep the spirit of Abbot alive on the Andover campus as well during her time as a Trustee. She actively participated in the effort to name the entrance of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library “The Abbot Academy Entrance and Lobby.”\n “Abbot wanted to have its name part of and central to the school, and [Bing] and I and several others worked very hard to raise money for that… We thought it was very important to have the Abbot name and we’re very happy that we raised the money to do that,” said Betsy Powell AA ’56, Trustee Emerita. \n Bing’s passion for education was evident in her lifelong commitment to Andover and the many other school boards and committees that she volunteered for. \n “[Bing] had knowledge of how other boards of trustees worked, how they maneuvered, how they raised money, how they dealt with parents, and she brought that type of knowledge to [The Andover Board of Trustees],” said Powell. \n “If there were two points of view, or three points of view, or many points of view, [Bing] was good at bringing those points of views together so the school could decide on one thing and move forward,” she continued. \n Bing was the President Emerita of the Board of Trustees at The Trevor Day School in New York, NY. She also participated on the board of Early Steps, a program that helps students of color apply to independent schools, Search and Care, a service program for the elderly, and the New York League of Conservation Voters.\n “I remember when I was navigating the wonderful world of getting [kids] into a kindergarten and I called upon [Bing] for advice about what schools she recommended. Education and particularly educating young people was something that she cared about and gave a lot of time and treasure to,” said McCabe.\n Through all of her interests and contributions to Andover and organizations in New York, NY., Bing’s warm personality remained her greatest attribute, McCabe said.\n “What I admired about [Bing] was that she had a tremendous vitality to her. Any time that you were in her air space there was this energy, this vitality,” McCabe added. \n “And her passion! She was not quietly passionate about stuff, she was very open. She had a great joie de vivre. She was a lot of fun and had a great laugh. She definitely commanded the room. She was a really strong, happy, upbeat person. I’ll always remember that about her,” she continued. \n Born on April 6, 1942 in Belfast, ME., Bing came to Andover as an Abbot student in 1957.

Some of these resources evolve into project ideas, and different departments across campus collaborate to learn something new, Jamie Kaplowitz, Education Associate and Museum Learning Specialist at the Addison, said. This was the fifth LAMs lunch of the year.\n The ceramics exhibit at the lunch was a collaboration between the Peabody Museum and the Math Department. The goal of the project was to find out which of the three locations had a higher proportion of ceramics that were black on red, black on white, or other. \n “The black on red sherds are the newest, and the black on white ones are the oldest. Students in the statistics class counted all of the sherds at the different sites and ran an analysis,” said Marla Taylor, Collections Manager of the Peabody Museum.\n Another table at the lunch on Tuesday had financial information that Andover has been collecting for over 75 years. \n “There are teacher receipts, and even the salaries teachers got. Look here. It says John Adams was paid $30 in 1810. It is interesting to see how the salaries changed over the years,” said Paige Roberts, Director of the Archives. Roberts digitizes these archival items, which come from both the old Abbot Campus and Phillips Academy.\n “I learned that I can participate in classes with the Peabody that intertwine trigonometry and archeology. My favorite part was learning what John Adams earned… when he worked here,” said Emma Murphy ’17. \n Another one of the tables showed the correlation and connection between math and music by presenting several “mathematical” compositions, or songs that are composed using mathematical concepts. According to Carl Johnson, the W.B. Clift Head Music Librarian, “music has been fundamentally interrelated with mathematical concepts throughout history.”\n “In the time of the Greeks, music was one of the sciences like math. It was not really considered an art at the time. In the earlier 20th century in Austria, rows of pitches would correspond to numbers,” said Johnson. “If you graph a parabola, that can even translate into music.”\n One of the LAMs collective’s goals is to show how the different collections across campus connect thematically, as shown by collaborations such as that between the Peabody Museum and Math Department. \n As of now, there are no concrete plans for the future, but the LAMs contributors are very open to working with teachers.

Inequity is a real threat to stability,” said Albright.\n Albright advocated for quality education and health services, which she said would increase the rate of children living until adulthood in low-income countries and increase human capital. Additionally, increasing access to education would create a growing body of adults with the tools necessary to combat climate change.\n Albright is the daughter of Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State for the United States, and served as Chief Financial and Investment Officer for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations from 2001 to 2009.\n\n', 'Jan 15, 2015'), ('\n“Please raise your hands if you like this planet as a place to be,” asked Ana Paula Tavares, Executive Vice President of the Rainforest Alliance, at the beginning of her talk on Wednesday in Kemper Auditorium. After a moment of surprised silence, nearly all the audience members raised their hands. “I thought so,” said Tavares. \n This opening set the tone for Tavares’s presentation about the importance of sustainability and the work of the Rainforest Alliance. According to its mission statement, the Alliance “works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior.” \n It attempts to do so by working with businesses, nonprofit organizations, governments and farmers under an environmentally friendly umbrella, said Tavares.\n Tavares added that pressure to switch to sustainable and ethical practices can come from exposure from environmental organizations, as well as from consumers. \n Using the example of the cocoa industry, Tavares highlighted the difficulties of ensuring fair trade while being sustainable. African cocoa farmers only earn $1 each day on average and often lack access to education and healthcare. \n Addressing issues of fair trade is part of the Rainforest Alliance’s mission, so Alliance-regulated farmers typically benefit from higher crop yields, greater incomes and increased access to healthcare and education, according to Tavares. \n Providing an example of a collaboration between people and nature, Tavares also presented a case study that the Rainforest Alliance had conducted in Guatemala. In 1990, the Guatemalan government gave portions of the Maya Biosphere Reserve to indigenous groups where people could live, as long as they followed certain sustainability regulations, said Tavares.\n The results of the study proved that the local nature had not been detrimentally affected by the legalized presence of humans by 2007; in fact, portions of the forest where human existence was outlawed experienced around 20 times more deforestation. The study went against the classical approach to forest conservation, where human use is banned in portions of land, and instead suggested a potential method where humans and nature live in congruity.\n To demonstrate the benefits of working with the Rainforest Alliance beyond the ethical and ecological responsibilities, Tavares related the anecdote of Chiquita Bananas, a corporation with which the Rainforest Alliance partnered when the company was facing bankruptcy. \n “European supermarkets were boycotting their bananas because of the environmental and social concerns they were having in Latin America,” she said in an interview with The Phillipian. \n “We partnered with [Chiquita Bananas] for nine years; they invested $20 million in the program… in order to become [Alliance-certified]…. They say that they gained $250 million in business just during that period of time… specifically because they were working with us and changing their practices,” she continued. \n In some industries, the solution offering the greatest short-term economic growth is sometimes unsustainable and unethical, according to Tavares. Addressing these situations can be difficult, as involvement with the Rainforest Alliance by the part of companies is voluntary.\n “We just work with people who want to work with us…. But more often than not, [irresponsible companies] will get … in trouble, and then they come looking for us, and they say, ‘Can you help us do the right thing?’” said Tavares. \n Tavares added that pressure to switch to sustainable and ethical practices can come from exposure from environmental organizations, as well as from consumers. \n “I think [issues regarding sustainability] are critical, and, if not solved, we’re going to have a real tough time, and we have right now a window of opportunity that is becoming shorter and shorter. I think that we need brilliant minds, young, brilliant new minds to come up with new solutions to some of these global challenges,” she said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nA new policy on domestic violence has been added to the faculty handbook, in accordance with recently passed Massachusetts legislation. Following the legislation, Andover is providing faculty up to 15 days of leave per year if they or their family members are subject to domestic violence. The policy change was drafted by Andover’s Human Resources office during Fall Term and proposed to the Senior Administrator Council (SAC), comprised of faculty who report directly to the Head of School for final approval. “Human Resources are the people who watch out for legal notices, and they make sure that our handbooks actually comply with [them],” said Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nIn accordance with recent trends, the number of Seniors that applied early to college increased to 87 percent, up from last year’s 80 percent, said Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling. Logan speculates that this continued rise is due to an increased awareness of the possible admission benefits that early application programs offer, the earlier availability of financial aid data for parents and the continued effort on behalf of the College Counseling Office (CCO) in preparing students for college decisions as early as possible. With some decisions still pending and many unreported decisions, the CCO has not yet been able to determine a final percentage of students admitted early. Although the school has seen an upwards trend in early applications for the past few years, Logan does not expect the number of early applicants to significantly increase in the future. Logan said that students do not apply early for a variety of reasons and that a large portion of the Post-Graduate population at Andover does not apply early to colleges. “I think there are reasons that students don’t apply early that are perfectly legitimate and fine…. I don’t see the number jumping another ten points,” he said. There are three different types of early application programs: early decision, restrictive early action and early action. Acceptances from early decision programs result in a binding agreement to enroll at the school. Restrictive early action, a program used by schools including Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford, according to Logan, allows the applicant to apply to other schools as long as those schools are public. Early action programs do not restrict applicants in any way. According to Logan, the majority of early applicants from Andover apply to early action schools. Students have many more options when they apply to early action schools because of the non-binding nature of the application, Logan explained. With this comes an incentive to apply early to multiple unlikely or reach schools, as students attempt to increase their acceptance chances by applying to multiple schools instead of one. Last year, the average early action applicant from Andover applied to three schools. “There are more opportunities to be had in the [early action application] process…. In general, it’s an opportunity for kids to get going,” said Logan. Early decision schools use the early application process to fill up large portions of the incoming class. Logan said, “Certainly, you can find a bit of a boost for kids who do the [early decision] route with [those programs,] because [schools] know that they are going to get the student.” He continued that, in early decision cases, it is critical that students have done extensive research on the school of their choice. “You really have to know that that’s the place you want to be,” said Logan. An important aspect of early action is the impact that it has on the second round of applications. Early acceptance into early action schools can help streamline the college application process: students may choose to rescind their applications from other colleges, ending the college application process months in advance, said Logan. Logan said, “[In] the big-picture research that we have done, every category improves applying early. But it varies, so if you are applying early to an unlikely school, it goes up a little bit but not a lot.” Another advantage of early action is that many schools offer merit-based scholarships in the process. The majority of early application schools are still highly competitive, and early application does not significantly help an applicant’s chance of acceptance, said Logan.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nThe number of students caught using e-cigarettes on campus has increased from zero last year to five this year, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, prompting the concern of Isham Health Center staff and cluster deans about substance abuse on campus.

Matthew Hession, Dean of Flagstaff Cluster, reminded students at his cluster meeting of the multiple on campus support systems available for students who may be struggling with these substances. According to Andrea Orben, health educator, the lack of research concerning e-cigarettes is particularly alarming. Although they do not produce smoke, they still contain nicotine, wrote Orben in an email to The Phillipian. “E-cigarettes use a battery powered heating element (not fire) as a mechanism to create an aerosol to deliver nicotine (not tobacco) to the user. E-cigs do not pose the risk of second-hand smoke to others but…one of the greatest known risks though is that e-cigarettes increases a user’s risk of nicotine addiction and hence their potential future exposure and/or usage of harmful tobacco products,” said Orben. “Since nicotine is addictive, [the school has], for years, provided help to students who wish to seek help from addiction,” said Murphy in an email to The Phillipian. Sarah Robinson, a Nurse Practitioner at Isham, said in an interview with The Phillipian, “Graham House does a lot of counseling and we do a lot of the medical assessment and prescribing if the level of usage is problematic enough to warrant medical treatment.” The use of tobacco and e-cigarettes can lead to impaired judgement and possibly cancer. Robinson said tobacco use can also be a gateway to the use of other drugs. “We [Isham Health Center] do a fair amount of assessing how much risk — if it’s just kind of casual use or if it is becoming more of a problematic addiction —and [we] can offer a variety of counseling support to try and get them to decrease their usage, and sometimes that involves medication like a nicotine patch or other medications that can help decrease cravings for nicotine,” said Robinson. Orben said that in addition to being detrimental to health, “nicotine and tobacco use (including the use of cigarettes, dip and e-cigarettes) is a major offense at Andover.” The Isham team hopes to broaden the health education regarding tobacco and e-cigarettes on campus. Although “Wellness Week” talks briefly about substance abuse, the staff at Isham to provide more opportunities to talk about substance abuse throughout all four years. A few of Andover’s peer schools have had cases of students being caught using e-cigarettes last year, unlike Andover, Murphy said.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nThe “triple threat” faculty workload system may be replaced by a new, more flexible, point-based system that is currently being trialled for the 2014-2015 school year. Unlike the previous system of a “triple threat” structure that requires teaching, coaching and residential involvement such as house counseling or chaperoning a dance, the new system will provide a flexible structure that allows for more freedom in faculty jobs. According to Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty, each faculty member must fulfill the same number of points in the new system, with each duty being equivalent to one point. For example, a faculty member interested in coaching a math team could do so instead of having to coach a sport. Previously, he or she would have had to coach a sport in addition to teaching and being involved in residential activities; coaching math would therefore have been a fourth duty. With the exception of the Admissions and College Counseling Departments, all faculty members have been trialling the system since this September and will continue to until June. The new system was put in place in response to faculty sentiment that the previous system of accomplishing three tasks was unfair and unbalanced, due to considerable discrepancies in time consumption, said Farrell. Additionally, this new system provides faculty with the freedom to prioritize their commitments, giving them the opportunity to focus their duties on their areas of interest and expertise, Farrell said. Farrell noted, however, that the new point system did not work well for people in the College Counseling, Admissions and Theatre Departments. “Those things become a little bit more difficult to calculate out accurately,” he said. Farrell said he hopes to have all faculty members in those three departments who are not currently trialing the program try out the new model by the 2015-2016 year. The new system was proposed last year by the Distribution of Faculty Workload Committee, consisting of five elected faculty members: Kathryn McQuade, Instructor in English, Fernando Alonso, Director of Outreach and Summer Session, Clyfe Beckwith, Instructor in Physics, Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics, and Daniel Schneider, Instructor in Mathematics. The policy has been added to the “Faculty/Administrator Supplement” that was published this month. The supplement, which is updated and released annually, is a Blue Book equivalent for faculty and staff that is part of the “General Policies Handbook,” Farrell said.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nConcluding a decade of teaching and mentoring, Frank Tipton will be leaving Andover at the end of the current academic year to become the Assistant Head of School of Gann Academy in Waltham, Mass. Tipton said, “I really hope to celebrate the good work of that school. It’s a Jewish school that is hoping to be both a source of pride for the Jewish community, as well as a progressive school.” In particular, Tipton, Dean of West Quad North Cluster and Instructor in History, said he was drawn to the school’s mantra of “tikkun olam,” a Hebrew expression meaning “repairing the world.” “[‘Tikkun olam’] is about making the world a better place, thinking about social justice, thinking about human dignity. Those are important elements of this school’s philosophy. I think that philosophy is also present here at Andover, but there’s an opportunity to work at [Gann Academy] as Assistant Head [of School] and be part of the vision and help to shape that vision,” said Tipton. Tipton said he greatly enjoyed his work as a teacher at Andover, citing his fondness for his History 100 and 200 classes. He said he would in all likelihood continue teaching history at Gann Academy. “History is a unique lens into the human condition…. I think we learn about ourselves when we learn about others, and I think history is one critical way to ultimately learn about ourselves through understanding the lives of others. History also to me is a development of ideas on the way the world works and the way human beings connect with each other, and to be able to understand how those ideas and relationships develop over time is especially enriching to us in the 21st century,” said Tipton. For the past six years, Tipton has immersed himself in the Andover community as an advisor to LGBTQ students at Andover, one of his many campus roles. Additionally, Tipton has had extensive experience with connections with diversity as an advisor to LGBTQ students, as a staff member and as a Cluster Dean. “I really think we have promoted profound conversations on [Andover’s] campus connected to gender, race and ethnicity, and I want to bring the spirit of those conversations to everywhere I’m going to be working in the future. Gann is my next stage, and I am excited to bring some of those ideas there,” said Tipton. Tipton said that his ten years at Andover have significantly shaped him into a more empathetic person, becoming more attuned to the psychological, emotional and the intellectual needs of the people in the community. “I’ve become more attuned to the physiological, emotional, as well as intellectual needs of the people in the community. I have also been humbled by the amount of talent that is in this community, and I enjoy attending performances and presentations by people in the community… because I really enjoy the opportunity to see other people’s knowledge and talents expressed,” said Tipton. He will replace current Assistant Head of School Ralph Van Inwagen at Gann Academy starting fall 2015. Before arriving at Andover, Tipton completed his Bachelor’s in Middle East Languages and Cultures at Columbia University and his Master’s in Arab Studies at Georgetown University. He has pursued his academic interests across the globe, having researched in the Middle East, Africa and China. Notably, he spent six months in Yemen studying the seaport of Aden. He first joined Andover as an Instructor in History in 2005.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nFor one month during her summer vacation as an 11th-grader, Willa Abel, Instructor in Biology, trekked through the muggy Sri Lankan rainforest with a scientist, tracking a single monkey and recording its actions every 30 seconds.\n Abel said, “For the longest time, living abroad was all I wanted to do.”\n Returning from maternity leave this term for her third year as a Biology 100 teacher at Andover, Abel recounted how her passions for travel and teaching tie together.\n “It’s simply a curiosity about the world. I would say that underlies everything I do. Just wanting to discover everything, whether that’s the genetics of a fruit fly or the different cultures of people around the world,” said Abel.\n According to Abel, her travels allow her to be a better teacher by giving her a “database of experiences” from all around the world that allow her to interact more personally with her students.\n Abel said, “I feel like I have a large sample size in terms of interactions that I’ve had with people around the world, and that helps me a lot with students because it has really enabled me to see people as individuals without getting too hung up on certain ways of thinking or doing things.”\n While growing up on the coast of Maine, Abel said that she had always felt different from her peers, so traveling became her solace.\n “When I was abroad, it finally felt normal to be different. I found that really, really liberating because suddenly [I] could just be [myself,]” said Abel.\n After visiting Sri Lanka, Abel took advantage of every spring break and summer vacation to wander the world. Since, Abel has ventured to France, India and Ecuador, spending three months in each. She then spent two years in each South Africa and Slovakia.\n “I love it when everyday you have all these little adventures,” said Abel. “[When I was in South Africa,] I’d have to lug my laundry to the ramshackle stall in the dodgy part of town and interact with the local guys. Every part of your day was fun.”\n According to Abel, despite her long-standing passion for travel, her love for Charlotte, her seven-month-old daughter, now trumps everything else. “It was the first time in my life I had to actually put someone else first, and it surprised me how much I didn’t mind,” said Abel.\n Abel said her favorite thing about Charlotte is her smile. “Whenever she sees someone new, she’ll smile,” she said. \n According to Abel, adjusting to motherhood was difficult at first. Being with her family in Maine over the summer helped ease her into maternity, but it was those first few weeks back at Andover alone with Charlotte that were hardest on Abel. \n “That was quite an adjustment because I was spending the whole day alone, at home. I would get to 4 [p.m.] and be fine and then I’d still have to wait a couple hours before I had any help,” said Abel. “It was just a long day. Little things you never thought about before, like taking a shower or even going to the bathroom, suddenly, those things were much harder.”\n Abel said she often daydreamed about work while on her maternity leave. “You find when you’re on maternity leave you have lots and lots of time to think about things but no time to actually do them,” she continued.\n She said that the time commitment required to be a parent has forced her to be more efficient with her work as a teacher.\n “I was always the first one in the office and I would log huge amounts of hours preparing for classes and grading. Now I discover that I have an hour a day maybe to both grade and prepare. It’s made me much smarter about how I use my time,” said Abel.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nAndover donated $500,000 to the Andover Youth Foundation (AYF) in support of the Town of Andover’s Cormier Youth Center, according to an email Head of School John Palfrey sent to the Andover community on December 16. The gift will fund the completion of the center’s multi-purpose room. Although the building itself has already been constructed, Palfrey hopes that the school’s gift will serve as an incentive for others in the community to help raise the additional $500,000 necessary to complete all the interior elements. “We’re thrilled to be able to support the youth center and to see the school’s founding principle of ‘non sibi’ (‘not for self’) animated in the energy and dedication of those behind this important project,” said Palfrey, according to the Andover website. After years of discussion on creating a town youth center, a series of town meeting approvals led to a groundbreaking behind Doherty Middle School last summer, and the 21,000-square-foot-building is now scheduled to open in late spring of 2015. The building’s facilities will include a gymnasium, classrooms, video lab, fitness room, multi-purpose room, kitchen and the offices of the town’s Youth Services Department. In an email to the Andover community, Palfrey gave special thanks to Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, and the Trustees for their effort in developing the facility. In his email, Palfrey addressed the importance of giving back to the community. According to Palfrey, Andover donates hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the Town of Andover. “We believe it is essential that we do our part as a community to support the town in which we live. We make a higher payment [to the Town of Andover], and do so more consistently, than any other school of our kind that we know of in the state. We will continue to seek to find ways to support the schools, public services and youth services of the Town of Andover — to do our part as an institution,” said Palfrey in his email.\n\n', 'Jan 8, 2015'), ('\nCalmly walking up and down the stage in Kemper Auditorium last Thursday, Professor David Canton discussed the history of racial and sexual violence in America to help give perspective to the events in Ferguson and across America. Canton said, “There is something much deeper than just Darren Wilson, Zimmerman and Pantaleo… It’s culture… We kill each other over our culture.”\n According to Canton, racism did not exist for ancient civilizations, even those that employed the use of slavery. Racism, a social construct, he reiterated, came after slavery, as a means of slavery’s justification. \n “[Ancient] people knew differences, but there wasn’t a system with advantages based on race. The Greeks enslaved everybody. Africans enslaved folks not in their ethnic group. So we’re black that didn’t matter. The Ashantians enslaved Non-Ashanti. The Arabs enslaved everybody– they didn’t care,” said Canton. \n “Stereotypes were constructed to rationalize hierarchies, to rationalize inequality, to justify superiority. I have to justify why I’m dominating somebody. If I see you as my equal, it’s hard for me to stab a knife in your face, ” continued Canton. \n Racism against black people, he said, arose after the institution of African slavery in the Americas. \n “The criminalization of Black men started in 1790. As the free black population expanded in the north black men became criminalized by elite white men. [White men] saw these guys as a threat to their economic security and privilege… So [they] constructed a criminal… the black beast rapist,” said Canton.\n This is reflected now in the recent discussions about race resulting from the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of white police officers, said Canton.\n “Darren Wilson. Mike Brown. White police officers, big black hulks. They aren’t human beings, [people think.] They are animals. Black guys are strong, they’re fast, they are known for their physical prowess… They’re not thinkers. They’re not smart… We are in a rigidly segregated nation,” said Canton.\n Canton said that the task of correcting the racist and sexist systems that reside in America lies on the shoulders of younger generations. He pushed students to read books and educate themselves on the history of racism and its profound and subtle effects on society, and create counternarratives about minorities to those portrayed in media. \n “It’s really the millennials, folks 14 to 21 that are the future. [They] can do better, but it takes sacrifice,” said Canton, “[Students should begin] building a counter-narrative, a counter discourse, which explains how these things originated, how they reproduced and how they prevent this country from being what it is supposed to be.”\n Canton is an associate professor at Connecticut College with a PhD in history from Temple University and a MA in black studies from Ohio State. Canton authored Raymond Pace Alexander: A New Negro Lawyer Fights for Civil Rights in Philadelphia, a winner of the 2011 W.E.B. DuBois book award, and is currently working on a new book project titled What Are You Going to Do About It.\n He has recently released written an article in Building Knowledge (BK) Nation titled “We are Not Brutus Jones: Confronting Stereotypes and Eradicating White Police Violence against Black Men” discussing the criminalization of black men in detail.

They are currently looking for applicants to join the project.\n “We believe this service will provide students with an accessible resource that will eliminate the social stigma around getting help at Andover. The issues on our campus are real: sleep deprivation, anxiety, stress, eating disorders, drugs, alcohol, racism, sexual assault, sexism, depression, and homesickness are present and detrimental to the health of our students,” wrote Cortner and Skrivanos in the email. \n “This online service will provide students with a trustworthy and beneficial resource surrounding questions and concerns pertaining to the issues above,” they continued.\n The announcement was forwarded via email to the student body by Carol Israel, Director of Graham House Counseling Center.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2014'), ('\nUpon learning of her appointment as the new Dean of Students, Jennifer Elliott, Instructor in History and Social Sciences, was overcome with mixed emotions of excitement and nervousness, anticipating the challenges offered by her new position.\n “I would say that other feelings that quickly followed were real gratitude and humility in terms of just the emails from colleagues and students who gave me their best wishes. I felt so grateful for their support. I’ve created a little file in my mailbox so that hopefully, in the harder moments, I can go back to those things and remember that people have faith in me right now,” said Elliott. \n Head of School John Palfrey announced Elliott’s appointment as Dean of Students in an email to the Andover community on Friday, November 21. \n In her new role as Dean of Students, Elliott hopes to tackle the issue of “well-being” on campus.\n “Well-being speaks a lot to stress management and thinking about how to manage the really high expectations that we impose on ourselves. [I want] to think through how we can use that [stress] in a more productive way,” she said. \n Elliott hopes to partner with the Wellness and Empathy Committee of the Strategic Plan, who is also focusing on issues of stress and well-being of Andover students. \n “I’m ready and eager to hear specific recommendations that [the Wellness and Empathy Committee] has for the Dean of Students Office, so I’m just getting myself in position to be pretty flexible, responsive and adaptive to those recommendations,” Elliott said.\n In particular, Elliott looks to work with Amy Patel, Medical Director, and Carol Israel, Director of Counseling at Graham House, to draft a program that educates students about health and wellness in order to combat the pressure and stress placed on students.\n By analyzing, adopting and adapting models of health programs at peer schools, Elliott hopes to create an alternative to the current Personal & Community Education (PACE) course. \n “There are so many qualities of PACE and so many topics that get addressed that are super important and worthwhile, and I would just say that I want more. I want more regular interaction, and I want more teachers and faculty involved, if possible,” said Elliott. \n “I think [teaching students about wellness] is at the center of being able to do anything else that we want to do. It’s like basic maintenance, and I want to prioritize that and give more time to it,” she continued. \n Elliott said her biggest concern in transitioning from being a teacher to the Dean of Students is becoming disconnected from students. \n “To lose that access and that interaction with kids would not only be really hard on a personal level for me, but I also think it would be hard to do a good job [as Dean of Students] without it,” said Elliott.\n Elliott aims to maintain a sense of accessibility and comfort with students by hosting munches at the Dean of Students’s house or even opening up the Dean of Students Office to students during conference.\n “I try to be a pretty accessible person in general in terms of feeling friendly and someone kids feel comfortable talking to. Part of that I hope is instinctive, and kids will feel like I’m an adult on campus that they can come talk to,” said Elliott.\n Looking ahead, Elliott expressed concerns about not having enough time to devote to her many passions on campus, including teaching history, coaching Girls Varsity Squash and working with the Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP).\n “For me, trying to maintain my role in the classroom is going to be really important, in terms of just being able to have contact with students on a regular basis. I know for my health and well-being, getting regular exercise and being able to teach are two things that really keep me going,” said Elliott.\n “I think, more than anything, [I’m] trying to figure out what to give up… I would love to be able to maintain both [teaching and coaching]. Mr. Murphy’s given me good advice that it doesn’t make sense to coach and teach at the same time, so perhaps I’ll end up coaching in the winter and teaching in the fall and spring,” she continued.\n Elliott said that while it will be difficult to balance teaching and coaching with her responsibilities as Dean of Students, she hopes to continue to do both. She also hopes to continue to work with GLP. According to Elliott, spending time with the girls in the mentorship program is crucial to her.\n “My work with [GLP] is at the core of what I think about all the time. I’m trying to figure out how to partner with other faculty members to share in the fun there … I love being able to work with the girls, so I wanted to make sure that I still have access and time with them,” said Elliott.\n Until she assumes the new position on July 1, 2015, Elliott will continue to be the House Counselor of Stowe House, to teach History and Social Sciences, to coach the Girls Varsity Squash Team and to serve as the Dean of Abbot Cluster.\n\n', 'Dec 11, 2014'), ('\nIn continuation of community-wide conversations following recent events in Ferguson, MO., David Canton, Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at Connecticut College, explored America’s history of racial and sexual violence in Kemper Auditorium on Thursday night. “[Canton] is coming to give historical context to the Ferguson and [Staten Island] situations and why there is such a strong and momentous response to the deaths of these two men,” wrote Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, in an email to The Phillipian. Canton’s lecture was followed by a Q&A session. “[Canton] will answer even your most difficult questions,” said Griffith, before the presentation. “We have a lot to learn from our history — these deaths of Brown and Garner are not isolated, and students should have information to help them have conversations about these difficult topics. We owe it to the community to provide opportunities for education and dialogue in these challenging times in our nation. You must understand the history that has led us to this moment,” continued Griffith. Canton’s presentation is a part of a series of programs at Andover initiated to address issues of race in the United States. The programs will be developed further over the course of the year.

After explaining her problem, her teacher returned to class the next day with a different way to teach her.\n “[This experience] taught me two things: it’s okay to look through a different lens. Having a different perspective on things will teach you so much about who you are as a person. Secondly, it taught me to find someone who can act has your lighthouse…find mentors,” said Chin.\n Chin also described her experience coming out via Facebook. “Even though I already told so many of the people I was closest to, [coming out on Facebook] unlocked all these things for people that are the next level of people I was connected to,” said Chin.\n In the Facebook post, Chin offered words of encouragement to those going through similar struggles. \n “First, don’t let fear be the better of you, don’t let anyone or anything hold you back from who you can become. Second, give all of yourself, your life will be better. Third, be kind to yourself. Fourth, you are strong enough. God created you to be strong enough. Finally, you will survive this. You are loved.

As a result of the meeting, Carter has become a mentor to Chin, and after leaving Facebook in April 2014, Carter offered Chin a position as a CEO of a new media company.\n “[Meeting Carter] is an illustration of a time when I manifested something for myself through hard work and lots of courage. I always wonder what people do when they have three minutes of someone’s time,” said Chin.\n Chin discussed being biracial. For Chin, being half Chinese and half white meant that she was never fully Asian or fully a part of the “white community.”\n “Being half Chinese is another lens that I get to look through.

Students also had the opportunity to explore the history of music at Andover.\n The event contained resources from the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), the Robert S. Peabody Museum, the W.B. Clift Music Library and the Addison Gallery of American Art. Each institution offered a different perspective on music in our community.\n “Music is a theme that actually runs through all of the different institutions [of LAMs],” said Carl Johnson, a Music Librarian in the W.B.

The archives also include music concert programs from the 1800s. \n Additionally, the archives own copies of “The Andover Song Book,” a collection of cheers and songs Andover students used to shout in support of the football team.\n “Someone could easily write a research paper on any one of these topics,” said Roberts as she described the massive collection to a group of students.\n The Peabody has a collection of musical instruments discovered underground in Pecos, NM., and even has a guide to creating a bone flute. The Peabody searches for musical artifacts in addition to all the artwork it collects.\n “Music is not just used for enjoyment purposes, but also for ceremonial purposes,” said Bonnie Sousa, Senior Collections Manager at the Peabody.\n The OWHL also runs a music streaming service on their website that allows students to listen to various genres of music from a variety of decades in addition to their collection of e-books about music and music history.\n The Addison hosted an exhibit called “Colorsound,” a project created by an artist to convey the sound of colors by taking any color terms found in scores of music and combining them to create a unique concoction of artistic representation.\n The W.B. Clift Music Library hosts a collection of music that most students do not take advantage of. Anybody can go into the library and take out CDs or even borrow a guitar or record player.\n “These resources prove you can think outside the box when it comes to music,” said Emily Goss, Circulation Assistant at the OWHL.\n The school offers such resources to students at any given time.

The granted projects, which received partial or full funding, ranged from upgrading the fitness center to inviting a mental health speaker to campus. Jair Kornegay ’15, AJ Augustin ’15 and Hanover Vale ’15 were awarded $4,588 to install gender inclusive bathroom signs in 51 single-stalled bathrooms all over campus. According to Vale, the project began as a “brainchild of the [Gender and Sexuality Alliance]” starting with discussions of accommodating open-gender, non-binary students. “[On current single-stalled bathroom signs] you have a clear representation of male and then a clear representation of female, with one figure in a dress and the other [not in a dress]. That sort of reinforces a binary that we don’t want to have here,” said Vale. Vale said that had the group not been awarded the grant money, their project would still have been completely funded by the Dean of Students Office who supports the initiative. The new bathroom signs are to be installed around campus by next year. One of the larger grants awarded was to establish a Social Justice Leadership Institute, led by Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator, and Thea Rossman ’15. The group will be working with Boston Mobilization to coordinate a group of Andover students and selected students from other schools who will participate in social justice and leadership education one weekend in the spring, according to Abbey Siegfried, the Andover liaison for the Abbot Academy Association and Instructor in Music. This coordination will become an annual event. Rebecca Somer ’15, Claire Jacobson ’15 and Nathaniel Redding ’16 were awarded $4,930 to invite a specialist from “Active Minds,” a group of ten professional mental health speakers, to present on campus. “We wanted to continue the [mental health] discussion and bring a professional speaker to come talk about what mental health means, what it means to have good well-being and a healthy mind,” said Somer. “Also, [we want to] start the conversation on campus because [mental health is] a slightly ‘taboo’ topic because kids are afraid of showing any signs of weakness,” she continued. The group has yet to determine who the actual speaker will be; however, they hope to invite the speaker around late February, according to Somer. Similarly, Whit Findlay ’16, the head and founder of Explorer’s Club, which was created this year, received $800 to bring Jon Turk ’63, environmental scientist and adventurer. Turk will come to campus in early April to speak about some of his adventures, including kayaking across the Pacific Ocean and around Cape Horn, living with Siberian reindeer herders and skiing some of the first slopes in Kyrgyzstan. “In an age of digital technology we can look back into discovering in essence. [Turk] is all about finding unseen and unknown cultures. We are so about diversity, but we forget about our exploratory nature just because we think that everything is on campus,” said Findlay. Sina Golkari ’15 and EJ Kim ’15 received a fund of $1,800 for the genetic testing of the skeleton of a Prussian mercenary in the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archeology. In the fall, the pair’s independent project identified the sex, age, pathologies and stature of the Prussian mercenary using traditional forensic anthropological methods.

According to Siegfried, every application is thoroughly read by the board, followed by a two minute presentation given by applicants describing their proposal at the Abbot Academy Association Dinner. “Awarded grants truly permeate every aspect of life at Andover, and grants that are very well thought-out, well-written and proposed are always seriously considered,” said Siegfried.\n\n', 'Dec 11, 2014'), ('\nSpeaking about his latest work to develop fully automated smart kitchens and phones that only need to be charged once a week, Dr. Paul Berger ’81, brought to life the career of an electrical engineer during his talk to the Physics and Robotics Club on Monday night.\n Berger, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University, said “How cool would it be to have a cellphone that you only have to charge once a week? We’re trying to make the circuits more energy thrifty because battery scientists aren’t really doing their job.”\n Berger also detailed his latest project in which he hopes to reduce power consumption in phones. He is developing more efficient transistors and memory in microprocessor chips, the technology used in phone circuits. \n Berger was honored last year with the “Outstanding Engineering Educator Award” from Franklin County Chapter of the Ohio Society of Professional Engineers.\n His teaching method is rather unusual, Berger said. “I really try to pin what we’re learning in class to the real world. I will try to join the dots and relate it to a device that you use everyday, it’s the charging circuitry in your cell phone, this is why it matters,” he said.\n “I tend to throw my undergraduates in the lake and see if they swim. They either quit or they thrive. I told them one day, build me a graphene reactor, they went and built an entire delivery system, [one that produces and ejects single sheets of carbon], winning the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum twice,” he continued.\n Berger’s teaching style shifts the educational focus away from number crunching and towards communicating. \n “If you can’t communicate, your brilliant ideas have no value. I actually am notorious for giving essay questions. I want to make sure you get the big pictures,” he said.\n After graduating from Andover in 1981, Berger went on to the University of Michigan and earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. Since then, Berger has worked across the globe, teaching at University of Delaware and doing research projects in Germany, England and Belgium.\n “When I was [at Andover], engineering was not thought of as a career… what I would like to advocate is that engineering really makes the world work. Engineers are the ones who makes the trains and cars run, everything you take you granted in society I argue comes from engineers,” said Berger.\n “We need innovators. Engineering is really the driver, you need to have the innovators creating those if you don’t have a core of really good engineers developing then your company is doomed. We need young professionals to consider these disciplines, continued Berger.\n Carson Wardell ’16, Co-head of the Physics club, said,“I better understood the trials and tribulations of research I didn’t understand how much work and failure went into technological advances.”\n\n', 'Dec 11, 2014'), ('\nStanding silently in the chilled air on the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall last Friday night, students lifted up candles in memory of those of the black community who lost their lives due to police brutality. The four-and-a-half minutes of silence reflected the four-and-a-half hours that Michael Brown’s body lay on the streets of Ferguson, MO., this past August. \n The candlelight vigil followed an hour-long community forum facilitated by students and faculty in Kemper Auditorium. The forum focused on the racial issues facing America in light of the grand jury decisions to not indict the police officers who killed Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Over 300 students attended the forum, according to Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development. \n “The goal [of the forum] was not to achieve uniformity but to enable reflection and initiate a set of conversations that will continue,” said Thomas Kane, Instructor in English. \n Although the subjects of conversation at the forum varied, discussions were primarily based on an exchange of perspectives and ideas. \n “I think for me it was also important that people came with open minds and were willing to hear different perspectives. [It was also important] that they were able to consider perspectives that were different from their own and try to understand why the things that they may be thinking are different from their peers and why that might be,” said Carrie Ingerman ’15, a discussion moderator. \n Several groups focused on how students could advocate and assist in changes they believed were necessary in response to the cases. Some suggestions included advocating against specific, racially slanted laws or reforming the prosecutorial system.\n “You look at the way the prosecutor in the Michael Brown case worked, and [then] you think about the way the prosecutor typically works with the police to get evidence to prosecute criminals. But when you have a prosecutor who has to prosecute a police officer, that presents itself as a conflict of interest automatically,” said Devontae Freeland ’15, another discussion moderator. \n Other discussions focused on more practical concepts, talking about the possible integration of such discussions of race into a classroom setting and the extension of conversation beyond forums. \n “I think that we should talk about race in all different kinds of places. It can’t just be at these forums. I think that with these forums, it’s hard to delve deep into these topics … I think these topics would be a lot more easily discussed in the dorm and classrooms,” said Fiona Yonkman ’16.\n Several groups also discussed the Ferguson case itself and grappled with the trial’s outcomes and the events surrounding it. The conversation included the emotional responses and experiences of Andover students to the events.\n “I was not surprised [by the non-indictment] because I expected that, but I was shocked as well because I feel like we’ve gone through so much as a country as a whole and it was like ‘Wow, this can happen again.’ … I’m still working on getting the whole story because I don’t think I can make a just opinion from what I’ve been hearing,” said Justice Robinson ’18.\n After the non-indictments that resulted from both the Brown and Garner cases, both students and teachers alike felt the necessity for discussion both on the physical events and emotional responses.\n “I think a huge part of the problem with events like the tragedy in Ferguson [and] Eric Garner’s death is you only have certain pockets of people … grieving …. It was so important to have all of Andover realize that this was an important event,” said Jaleel Williams ’15, a moderator. \n “The Ferguson case brought up many questions and emotions for many students like me… For me, the forum provided both answers to my questions and a safe space to work through emotions and feelings related to the events of Ferguson,” said Akhil Rajan ’17.\n\n', 'Dec 11, 2014'), ('\nIn January, the faculty will vote whether to retain the room visiting rules passed last spring, or implement a new alternative policy.\nThe alternative policy will be revised beginning this Monday when faculty members vote on amendments to the the alternative proposal.

The Sykes Center will have two floors, with medical services occupying the second floor and the Graham House Counseling Center occupying the lower level.\nAdditionally, the Sykes Center will rely on geothermal energy for heating and cooling. According to Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, the energy will be supplied from 19 500-foot-deep wells. This will be the first geothermal system on campus.\nThe Sykes Center will feature two “Community Wellness Activity Rooms.”\n“These rooms are going to be for all sorts of activities.

McCaffrey served in the U.S. Army, as well as in the federal government as the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) from 1996 to 2001. \n “Right now we’re in the midst of a period in Washington when people are saying, ‘We’ve seen the end of warfare.’ Foot warfare, tank warfare, warfare at sea, that’s all past, [they say,] and what we’re going to think about [for the future] is small unit operations. Nation building. Counterterrorism. Counterinsurgency. And I would say that’s short-sighted,’ said McCaffrey.\n “At the end of the day, the Andover boys and girls in the room today, before their age of 50, will see all forms of threats to our allies or the American people. And we’ve got to be prepared,” he continued.\n According to McCaffrey, there is currently a sense of apathy in regards to defense against weapons of mass destruction. “Very few people talk about them. We have no champions in uniform or in Congress about maintaining America’s nuclear deterrence capability,” said McCaffrey. \n The dinner, hosted by Andover in the Military, an Andover’s veteran alumni affinity group, was attended by Andover alumni, veterans, faculty and trustees.\n Paresky Commons served around 500 red, blue and white cupcakes this past Tuesday to commemorate Veterans Day. The cupcakes were arranged in the Paresky lobby to resemble the American flag. \n Flags were placed on the headstone of the 49 veterans which are buried in the campus cemetery. \n Students signed letters to Alexi Bell ’13, Taylor Perkins ’12 and Christopher Kent ’11, alumni currently enrolled in one of the nation’s military academies. \n Andover and the Military met on November 6 to discuss the publication of the next edition of the “Blue Guidon,” the organization’s newsletter.

Wagner said that good teaching in school will require change in the traditional educational constructs and rethink what it means to make a change in the learning process. \n According to Wagner, the competition to acquire knowledge has been replaced by the last-minute Google search. “Students no longer demonstrate the patience and time dedication necessary to finding answers,” he said. \n Wagner said that innovation demands risk and failure, but he noted that students are not willing to fail in order to grow from their mistakes.\n “The fear of failure completely countered the equation as penalty, and instead discouraged experimentation,” said Wagner.\n Wagner said he believes that if more group projects were to be incorporated into the curriculum, it would increase the possibility of innovation amongst students in classes. \n This move has already been executed in the workforce environment; many jobs are now towards moving team-based projects, as they have proven to yield results that could often not be met through isolated work, said Wagner. \n In addition, Wagner emphasized the importance of collaboration and the essentiality of growth in education. “Teach collaboration instead of competing so often, as students do in any boarding school,” he said. \n Acknowledging the essential role time for reflection and innovation allows for growth, Wagner presented the concept known as “Google Time,” which is currently being implemented at Google’s Mountain View campus. The system allots 20 percent of Google employees’ time towards a project of their own choice. \n According to Wagner, the advisors that oversee the progress help avoid the project from turning into free time. Wagner said that this approach could be successfully implemented at Andover, since, as Wagner said, the main inhibitor of innovation is the lack of time cut out for its creation.\n Furthermore, Wagner introduced High Tech High, a public school in San Diego, CA, where project-based learning is the main focus of the curriculum. According to Wagner, the school’s methodology revolves around group projects that allow students to collaborate in group projects where they work solely with other students in order to better understand the topic. \n Wagner showed an example of student groups recreating their own working renditions of the Mayan architecture and comparing their results to those of Mayan history. The results showed that students had similar constructions to those used in ancient Mayan civilization. Wagner said that this form of innovation allowed the students to learn in a completely new way of thinking.\n Wagner has recently written two books on education, “Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change the World” and “The Global Achievement Gap: Why Even Our Best Schools Don’t Teach the New Survival Skills Our Children Need — and What We Can Do About It.”\n\n', 'Nov 13, 2014'), ('\nRobin Crawford, former Instructor in History, passed away at age 76 on October 22 after a long battle with leukemia. In 1971, Crawford arrived on campus to serve as Dean and Director of Admission for Summer Session and as an Instructor in History. During his 32-year-long tenure at Andover, Crawford also served as Director of the College Counseling Office and faculty advisor to the Philomathean Society. Marcelle Doheny, Instructor in History, said, “He was a very good colleague to me, but more importantly, he was my friend. We just met over the summer and had coffee, and I’m so glad we did. He was still recommending books to me [after he retired], talking to me about ideas, talking to me about politics and school and history. It was the same Robin. I will miss him very, very much.” Dr. Carol Israel, a Graham House Counselor and Instructor in Psychology, said, “He taught me the word ‘curmudgeon.’ Before I came to Andover, I had never heard of that word. Who uses that word? And I didn’t know what it meant until I came here, and that was him. He was a curmudgeon: cranky, stern, firm, but with an absolute heart of gold.” Elisabeth Tully, Director of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), who worked with Crawford as an advisor to the Philomathean Society, said that, despite Crawford’s “gruff” approach to teaching, he inspired and connected with students. “He could be scary… but he could do it in such a way that kids would not feel devastated when he yelled at them. They would feel like, ‘I [have] to do better than this,’” said Tully. “He walked that fine line between being harsh but ultimately supportive at the same time, saying, ‘I believe in you. I know that you can get this. You just have [to] work a little harder.’ That’s really excellent teaching,” she continued. Doheny said she best remembers Crawford’s sense of humor, his big personality and the way he laughed out loud with his whole body. She also recalled Crawford’s passion for the subject of history, saying that he influenced his students through his own great enthusiasm. “He was one of those guys who had a great passion for history — just loved the subject. He had very high standards for the students and for himself, and he had a real following [of students]. Many students just really clicked with him and loved his class,” said Doheny. “When he died, I realized that there are only maybe four of us [currently] in the [Department of History] that worked with him, which really struck me quite forcibly because he was so larger than life. It seems so strange to me that so many of my colleagues don’t know who he was. He was such a force of nature that it seemed odd that other people wouldn’t remember that,” she continued. Israel said that, although she and Crawford taught in vastly different fields of history and psychology, Crawford’s passion for ideas drew them together. “He was one of the smartest people that I knew. He loved ideas, so he was wonderful to talk to. He was like an intellectual’s intellectual. He loved ideas in all sorts of fields. He was in history, I’m in psychology, and he was just as interested in the ideas in my field as he was in his,” Israel said. In addition to maintaining deep connections with his students, Mary Mulligan, Instructor in History and a former colleague of Crawford, said that Crawford was deeply devoted to his family, calling him a “family man.” “Anytime we’d get talking about his children or my children, he was just transformed. He loved family. He kept that gruff exterior, but what anyone who knew him realized pretty early on was that, inside, he was a very sensitive, loving guy,” Mulligan said. After retiring, Crawford briefly moved to Maine before moving to Portland, OR, where he lived with his daughter, Elizabeth, and his grandson, Kai Gilmore. According to Tully, Crawford became a main caretaker of Gilmore, and the two spent much of their time together. During Crawford’s last year at Andover, his wife, Katie Crawford, was diagnosed with cancer. She died shortly after he retired, and he endowed a fund in her honor at the OWHL to purchase children’s books, according to Tully. “We continue to buy books that are for Katie Crawford. That was a fund that he set up because both of them loved libraries, reading and the life of the mind,” said Tully. According to an obituary published on the website of Holman’s Funeral Service, memorial donations in honor of Crawford may be made to the Kathryn S. Crawford fund for children’s books at the OWHL.

Her article “Illicit Traffic of Pre-Columbian Antiquities,” published in a 1969 issue of “Art Journal,” came at a time when many archaeologists were ignoring the unethical trade of antiquities. The article detailed the illicit exportation of artifacts from Guatemala and Mexico.\n“I had no idea I was going to do the things I did. I was drawn into it by the horrible situation: somebody had to make a fuss and point out to people [to] look [at] what’s going on,” she said.\nBy 1983, Congress passed the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, which stopped the illegal trafficking of cultural and archaeological artifacts.\n“Occasionally… [the artifacts] were turning up in museums and collections in the United States and in Europe… We could demonstrate where they came from and that it was against the laws of those countries and destructive,” said Coggins in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAfter graduating from Abbot Academy, Coggins went on to Wellesley College where she discovered her passion for art history. However, it was while attending Harvard for graduate school that a professor inspired her to work in Central America at the site of Tikal.\n“It’s immensely satisfying to work on collections of objects and working out for oneself what they reveal. They are puzzles, interesting historical puzzles that can be demonstrated on the basis of what you are looking at,” said Coggins in an interview with The Phillipian.\nCoggins credited her Abbot education for broadening her horizons. Before attending Abbot, Coggins attended a progressive school, she said.\n“Abbot was a classically strict girls boarding school and an excellent one. The teaching was superb, and the teachers I knew [were] especially supportive and encouraging,” said Coggins during her ASM speech.\n“If I have any message learned from the trajectory of my career, it is that, since I ended up working in many directions I had never foreseen, one must always keep open to unimagined possibilities,” she continued.\nNow retired, Coggins plans to complete publications on both Yucatan, Mexico, and Tikal, Guatemala.

What was previously a democratic state was now governed under General Wojciech Jaruzelski’s martial law. On December 13, five copies of Darnton’s article that would alert the world of Poland’s new government were smuggled to America in the boot of an American hippie and a cigarette box, among other methods.\nIn 1982, Darnton accepted the Pulitzer Prize for attempting to deliver the truth to the public in the face of violent punishment from General Jaruzelski’s regime. It was with this dedication to delivering the truth that Danton would approach his future articles, being jailed in some cases for his work.\nInitially a copyboy for the New York “Times,” Darnton said that he entered journalism because previous family members had written for the “Times.” Yet despite this history, Darnton did not do any journalism while at Andover or college.\n“The first couple of years that I worked… I always felt like I was trying to catch up… so I was consequently nervous a lot of the time at the beginning. Then I remember a period in which I just kind of felt more at ease with it… and then I loved it,” said Darnton in an interview with The Phillipian.\nBefore his 40-year career at the “Times,” however, Darnton was a student at Andover. During his speech at this week’s ASM, Darnton recalled his character back at Andover as a rebel and said that, although the consequence he faced was harsh, it was not malevolent. After escaping the confines of his room to grab a beer in Lowell, Mass., Darnton was expelled only three months before graduation.\n“Even if things look dark, it doesn’t mean they… will always be dark. Be ready to go with changes, not just freeze, paralyze and panic if something goes wrong. Life is very long, and life has a way of ironing out some of these problems,” Darnton said.\n“Life is serendipitous, and the events that may seem insupportable at the time may turn out to have positive results. Don’t despair, never despair,” he continued.\nWhile at Andover, Darnton was the editor of “The Mirror,” a creative writing literary publication, served as a Blue Key Head and participated in the Philomathean Society and Boys Varsity Soccer.\nDarnton has also written several books, including three science adventure novels, two satire novels and a memoir about his father.\nAfter working for the New York “Times” for over 40 years, Darnton retired in 2005. He is now the curator of the George Polk Awards in Journalism.\n“We give annual awards to the best reporters who have undertaken intrepid assignments or investigations, and we’ve been expanding on that program to give grants to reporters who want to investigate things,” said Darnton.\n“[Darnton] has an incredibly strong ethic about true beat reporting, covering the day to day stuff but then also an exploratory journalist. So he’s sort of digging deep to find the real truth of the story,” said Jennifer Savino, Associate Director of Alumni Engagement.\n**Susan Stedman\xa0AA ’59**\nA year after graduating from Stanford University, Susan Stedman AA ’59 found herself in Mississippi, working in the midst of a massive campaign to register African-American voters and to repress violence by white supremacists.\nWhile at Abbot Academy, Stedman served as Student Body Vice President and was a dedicated member of both Fidelio and an a capella group called the Silk Stockings.\n“I came to Abbot as a sanctuary from the chaotic jungle that my high school had become,” Stedman said.\nWhile the academic rigor of Abbot inspired Stedman to push herself, it was the way the school embraced skills of all types that she loved most, she said.\n“I thought all the girls [here] would be prim and proper. My god, they were Amazons! I mean, lacrosse and hockey, and all this stuff I’d never played. But it didn’t matter! Because I was valued for other things,” said Stedman in her ASM address.\nAfter graduating from Abbot, Stedman studied French at Stanford, then traveled to West Africa just two weeks after graduating college, where she discovered her interest in race relations.\n“I found a dog-eared copy of ‘Time’ magazine [there] about the Martin Luther King, Jr. March on Washington. I had grown up in a [predominately] white community, but I thought, ‘This is a terrible problem, and I want to be part of the solution.’ And so I decided to come home and get involved with the Civil Rights Movement,” said Stedman.\nStedman regards her gender as the biggest obstacle during her career, recalling her experience of interviewing with the Ford Foundation for a job position overseas in 1963 while earning her master’s degree.\n“I went in, and the woman who was interviewing said, ‘Oh my dear, you must be mistaken. These are overseas positions.’ [I replied] ‘Right, I’m getting my master’s degree in international relations.’ [She replied] ‘We don’t take women.’ I mean, you can’t believe this was legal,” said Stedman.\nShe served as the Executive Assistant to Dorothy Height, President of the National Council of Negro Women.\nAdditionally, Stedman has held various positions that involved working in West Africa. Stedman served as the second-in-command for the West Africa branch of the Ford Foundation. While working with the Ford Foundation, Stedman launched a program in Burkina Faso that is still running today.\nStedman also became the first Executive Director of Refugees International, an independent organization that works to provide assistance and protection for displaced people and solve displacement crises, according to the Refugees International website.\nIn her speech, Stedman challenged students to take advantage of all Andover has to offer.\n“Here you are, in the beautiful Andover bubble, a world full of opportunities. Don’t let it go to your heads. You know the real world is a very different place. Let Andover nurture, inspire, challenge and equip you to take your many gifts in to the world beyond, to lead, to help [and] to inspire others,” said Stedman.\nStedman now lives in Maine, where she serves as the Co-Chair of the Juniper Hill School, a Pre-K to fourth-grade school that uses place-based education to teach young children.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nElijah Aladin ’15 was hit by a car late Tuesday evening as he crossed Main Street on the way back to Taylor Hall from main campus.

During the month-long trial period, students will have free and unlimited access to approximately 143 magazines and periodicals for recreational reading via iOS-equipped technology, according to Stephanie Aude, Instructional Librarian. The trial has already begun and will last for about another month. “There are many advantages to using Flipster. Once [OWHL] decides to subscribe to a magazine or a periodical on Flipster, students [can] download the application on their iPads or iPhones and get access to the magazine digitally wherever they are, without paying for the subscriptions. Also, the digital subscriptions are available to multiple students at once, unlike the paperback subscriptions in the Freeman Room,” said Aude. “The collection on Flipster isn’t as extensive as [Andover] wants it to be… There is another popular digital magazine program called Zinio, which has a much bigger collection than Flipster, but we decided to look at other products because Zinio does a lot of upselling,” she continued. Flipster was first introduced to Andover by EBSCO, a company from which the school currently purchases all of its paperback magazines. Although Flipster is not the first mobile application created to provide digital subscriptions to magazines and periodicals, the OWHL found the product easily accessible and user-friendly for students, according to Aude. While Flipster is currently only accessible to iOS users, the EBSCO development team is also working to add Android and Windows accessibility, according to Aude. “EBSCO is a company that we already have a big relationship with; they are local and we feel that they are not going to upsell to our students… we feel that they are more geared towards working with students in a non-profitable way,” said Aude. According to Aude, whether or not OWHL will continue using Flipster will highly rely on student feedback. “OWHL is looking for suggestions on what types of magazines and periodicals students want to read and whether or not they find Flipster useful to have,” said Aude. “We really want to hear that people want to use this… The collection is relevant. It is a great, easy-to-use product. With so many people travelling during the holidays and kids taking long bus rides, this is a great way for kids to keep up with the current events and supplement their research materials in a very friendly, easy-to-use way,” she continued. Students can access Flipster through the website on any device, where they can download the application.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nThe construction of the first solar panels on campus is currently in the planning and is set to begin mid-Winter Term.

Along the way, too many of our students resort to unhealthy, unsustainable and/or unwise coping strategies when they feel particularly stretched. Too often, Andover students struggle to take care of themselves and each other with kindness, generosity and thoughtfulness. I have always felt that the greatest part being a member of this community is that you are surrounded by peers and mentors who inspire you to be and do better. While I hope that this striving for progress remains constant, I feel strongly that the health and well-being of our community and each individual must always come first. I think that the Dean of Students is uniquely positioned to tap into and coordinate the talents, energies and hard work of the deans, the residential faculty, day student advisors, the Graham House team and the Isham team to care for our students deliberately, carefully and effectively.\n**Q: What do you think is the most important quality of Dean of Students?**\nA: The Dean of Students needs to enjoy our students, have faith in our students and have high expectations for our students. The Dean of Students must protect the integrity of our community’s rules and expectations, cannot be afraid to hold students accountable for their actions and care for our students with compassion.

That’s part of the problem. I can’t imagine being a student in this day and age, considering all of the white noise that [they] all have. It seems to me that it’s hard to gain clarity when there’s so many distractions. I don’t know if that’s the biggest challenge, but it’s certainly a major one.\nI think it’s hard to think about ways of communication when the means of communication are so stunted, and I mean that in terms of not simply communicating with adults, but communicating with each other. I think there’s very little space for that.\n**Q: What do you think the most important quality of a Dean of Students\xa0is?**\nA: It seems a pretty thankless job. I imagine, for example, that the things that you get right, people aren’t necessarily going to know, but the things that you get wrong, those are the things that people are going to remember. There’s a kind of “thick-skinned-ness” that I think one has to have [while] at the same time being sensitive to the needs of all the people that you’re trying to serve. Also, it’s not just students that you’re trying to serve, but trying to ensure that the people who are in places that they need to be in are also supported. So, that we’re all working on this common goal which is to care for [the students] all in the best way that we can.\n**Q: Why do you want to be Dean of Students?**\nA: I think in all of my roles, I have established relationships with kids and have had opportunities in the trenches, if you will, that gives me a different kind of perspective on kids. There’s a way in which sometimes people can talk about students as if they’re the only ones who know kids, and who know them really well, and that kind of language and that kind of rhetoric is a little dangerous.\xa0But I do think that I have a lot to give in having served in multiple roles and in different kinds of roles and roles that are directly linked to kids.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nWalking around campus with their hosts on Wednesday, 20 prospective students from the Prep 9 program had the chance to experience a day in the life of an Andover student. Prep 9, a program under the Prep for Prep umbrella, prepares students for placement and future success at independent schools, according to the Prep for Prep website. The program targets students coming from public schools or low socioeconomic backgrounds who wish to attend a boarding school, according to Terrell Ivory, Assistant Dean of Admission. “The main reason why we have had a great relationship with Prep is [because] they are interested in recruiting the best and brightest students… which is similar to what Andover is looking for,” said Emilyn Sosa, Assistant Dean of Admission and Coordinator of Diversity Outreach. When the students visit campus, they partake in a two-day program organized by Andover. During the visit, Prep 9 students are assigned a host student and get the chance to stay overnight in their host student’s dorm. The students participate in classes with their host and have the opportunity to meet faculty members, as well as go on tours of the campus and have an interview, according to Sosa. Starting in the sixth and seventh grades, students who want to apply to boarding schools must complete a 14-month course to prepare them for success at independent schools, according to the Prep for Prep website. “While [the] program’s goal is placing high-achieving leaders in boarding school, arriving at the decision to go away to boarding schools is many times a process. Students and families buy into the program at different times, and Prep will work with them to understand boarding as an option,” wrote Sosa in an email to The Phillipian. Last year, 15 prospective students visited campus, and seven were accepted to Andover. “Not every student is the best fit for Andover. [Prep 9] does a good job of looking at their pool of students and helping us recruit the ones they think would fit in our community,” said Sosa. Nicole Rodriguez ’17, member of Prep 9 Contingent XXVI, visited campus for the first time in November 2012 to decide if Andover was the right fit for her. “My favorite part of my visit was going to the library with my brother during study hours. It all felt so natural to me, and I could see myself doing that for the next couple of years,” said Rodriguez. When students are accepted to Andover, they are assigned a coordinator from Prep 9 that works to support the students by checking in with them regularly to make sure they are enjoying their experience and doing well academically, Sosa said. “In the past, Prep students have performed very well and we want to continue our relationship with the program because we believe students [who come] through our doors are students who deserve to be here and have taken full advantage of the opportunity,” said Sosa. Along with Andover, Prep 9 is affiliated with Choate, Deerfield, Phillips Exeter Academy, Hill, Hotchkiss, Lawrenceville, Loomis Chaffee, Middlesex, Milton, St. Andrew’s, Taft, Groton and Tabor.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nDemocrat Seth Moulton ’97 won the congressional seat in Massachusetts’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday evening.\n Moulton defeated Republican candidate Richard Tisei of Lynnfield, Mass., in the general election.

Hale Sturges joined the French Department in 1965 and taught until his retirement in 2004. During his 39 years at Andover, Sturges served as an Instructor and Chair in French and later Chair of the Language Division, Coach of Varsity Baseball and House Counselor for 22 years in Fuess House and French House. “After being a house counselor for 22 years, my dad became a surrogate father to so many boys living in the dorm… I received numerous letters and emails from former students in the past couple of weeks that really struck me his depth of influence,” said Anne Gatewood, daughter of Hale Sturges, in an interview with The Phillipian. “It was really obvious in one level that he made a difference to all these kids, but I really didn’t understand how deeply and I didn’t realize that because he never put me or my sister as anything but his first priority,” she continued. Gatewood said that family and friendship and having fun with people he loved meant the world to Sturges. “He was a really, really fun dad: he was always playing games, from scrabble to croquet to catching balls. In the classroom, he always managed to make class fun: he would jump up and down and act out things…he was some sort of a looney tune… there was always a big laugh in every class,” said Gatewood. In addition to being family-oriented, Gatewood said that her father was always a student, rather than only being a teacher. She said that his curiosity for the world inspired him to travel all over the world. “He would always try to go to new places and learn about different people and the way different people lived their lives and have an appreciation for that,” said Gatewood. “Hale Sturges was an outstanding teacher and colleague. He was always interested and caring in what other people were doing and their ideas. He also really thought about what he was doing and his philosophy in teaching,” said Natalie Schorr, former Instructor in French, in an interview with The Phillipian. During his time as the Chair of the Language Division, Sturges was a strong advocate of teaching all levels of classes entirely in the target language, creating a total immersion experience for the students, said Schorr. “Essentially the reason why he did that was because he felt that he didn’t want students to think that English was more important than other languages and wanted students to have empathy for other languages and cultures,” Schorr said. “For [Sturges], it wasn’t just about teaching the language itself. It was teaching the history, the literature, and the culture of another language,” she continued. In addition, Sturges developed the Chinese Department back when only a couple of classes were offered, by hiring more teachers and leading the first faculty trip to China. Schorr added that he even tried to learn the language himself. Outside of his teaching career, Sturges held the Beinecke Foundation Faculty Chair for 21 years and also served as President of the Cum Laude Society. He also served on the boards of the American Memorial Hospital in Reims, France. Sturges also published two French textbooks, titled “Une Fois Pour Toutes, Encore Une Fois,” and “Par Tout Le Monde Francophone,” and wrote a sociological study titled “The People of Pleure: Portrait of a French Village.” “At Andover, he cared about others and this continued during his retirement in his work with outreach programs,” said Schorr. After retiring from Andover, Sturges continued to share his love of the French language and literature through teaching at Beacon Hill Seminars, where he taught courses in French and English, in addition to serving as Vice President of the board. Furthermore, Sturges taught English as a second language to recent immigrants. Jacques Hugon, Instructor in Math, first met Sturges while staying in Andover as a Post-Graduate international exchange student. He lived with Sturges and his family in their faculty housing apartment in Fuess House for part of the year. “[Sturges] became a mentor and a friend to me ever since we met in 1978,” said Hugon in an email to The Phillipian. “He and his wife opened their home to me on countless occasions, be it Thanksgiving, Christmas or just offering friendship and support at every moment of my adult life.” Hugon said that, with his cheerful and infectious laugh, Sturges had a wonderful ability to connect with everyone around him, adults and students alike. “He was passionate about teaching and a passionate Francophile who took great pleasure in his craft, as well as the daily contact with students. He loved the classroom experience, and it showed in the enthusiasm he showed for teaching French every day. He is truly a wonderful human being, friend, and mentor. I will miss him dearly,” Hugon wrote. Sturges graduated from Milton Academy in 1956, and received his Bachelor’s from Harvard College in 1960. He began his teaching career at Middlesex School in 1960, teaching French and Latin and continued teaching French at Andover. Sturges is survived by his wife and two daughters.

If we are going to make decisions about what is best for the school, we need [students] to be involved in that,” said Terrell Ivory, Assistant Dean of Admission.\n Students and faculty were randomly assigned to classrooms, where they participated in group discussions, co-facilitated by a member of student government and a faculty member.\n A recurring suggestion was to move class start-times back. Some proposed that conference period be moved to the beginning of the day, giving students the opportunity to meet with a teacher before class or to sleep in, Gutierrez said.\n “It was important that students finally make their own concerns heard… It will help improve other aspects for our community if this schedule gets fixed or tweaked,” said Gutierrez.\n Another idea that was repeated many times was to lengthen classes or even adopt a block schedule where each class met every other day for longer blocks of time, allowing teachers to go further in-depth during class time, according to Ivory.\n “I think the main problem right now with the schedule is just that so much is crammed into so little time. I think if we tried to have less classes in the days or tried to do the block schedules, that it would really help with the homework load and help with the crazy feel of a typical day,” Bilal said.\n School Congress also focused on potential changes to the yearly calendar, especially regarding the two-week period between Thanksgiving Vacation and Winter Vacation that kicks off Winter Term.\n Students and faculty were encouraged to write down their ideas on sticky notes.

If you truly believe that, you have to go into every situation, into every meeting, assuming that while you may have some truth, there might be some other truth out there that will be shown to you as you are having this conversation. You have to be able to be open to listening to that [other truth].\n**Q: Why do you want to be Dean of Students?**\nA: I want to do the job because we are at a time at Andover in which the next five years are going to define what the next 30 [years] will look like. That is very exciting… I really do believe that at its core, the Dean of Students office involves everything that happens on this campus because, without the students, we don’t have a school. That doesn’t mean students always get what they want, just like it doesn’t mean faculty doesn’t always get what they want. I want to be in a place in which we can have those conversations with students and adults and then figure out where we want this place to be together.\nJennifer Elliott\n\n[[{“fid”:”3869″,”view_mode”:”default”,”fields”:{“format”:”default”,”field_image[und][0][_weight]”:”0″,”field_image[und][0][fid]”:”0″,”field_image[und][0][display]”:”1″,”field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]”:””,”field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]”:””,”field_image_credit[und][0][value]”:””,”field_image_caption[und][0][value]”:””},”type”:”media”,”attributes”:{“height”:425,”width”:300,”class”:”media-element file-default”},”link_text”:null}]]\nA.WESTFALL/THE PHILLIPIAN\n**Q: For those who don’t know you, what are five adjectives to describe you?**\nA: Energetic, curious, committed, collaborative and optimistic.\n**Q: What do you think is the greatest challenge Andover students currently face, and how would you seek to remedy that?**\nA: Students face an exciting, challenging, stressful and, at times, daunting set of opportunities as they navigate their Andover experience. Along the way, too many of our students resort to unhealthy, unsustainable and/or unwise coping strategies when they feel particularly stretched. Too often, Andover students struggle to take care of themselves and each other with kindness, generosity and thoughtfulness. I have always felt that the greatest part being a member of this community is that you are surrounded by peers and mentors who inspire you to be and do better. While I hope that this striving for progress remains constant, I feel strongly that the health and well-being of our community and each individual must always come first. I think that the Dean of Students is uniquely positioned to tap into and coordinate the talents, energies and hard work of the deans, the residential faculty, day student advisors, the Graham House team and the Isham team to care for our students deliberately, carefully and effectively.\n**Q: What do you think is the most important quality of Dean of Students?**\nA: The Dean of Students needs to enjoy our students, have faith in our students and have high expectations for our students. The Dean of Students must protect the integrity of our community’s rules and expectations, cannot be afraid to hold students accountable for their actions and care for our students with compassion. The Dean of Students cannot shy away from hard conversations, and he or she must seek opportunities to find and celebrate the good in our students.\n**Q: Why do you want to be Dean of Students?**\nA: As we work to implement the goals of our strategic plan in the next few years, I think this is an exciting and prime opportunity to help shape and improve our school community. My favorite part of my work as [Dean of Abbot Cluster] is getting to know, working with, supporting and celebrating my Abbot students. I care deeply about their progress, health, and well-being. I see the role of the Dean of Students as a way to do similar work with the entire Andover student body.\nTasha Hawthorne\n\n[[{“fid”:”3910″,”view_mode”:”default”,”fields”:{“format”:”default”,”field_image[und][0][_weight]”:”0″,”field_image[und][0][fid]”:”0″,”field_image[und][0][display]”:”1″,”field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]”:””,”field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]”:””,”field_image_credit[und][0][value]”:””,”field_image_caption[und][0][value]”:””},”type”:”media”,”attributes”:{“height”:450,”width”:300,”class”:”media-element file-default”},”link_text”:null}]]\nJ.WOLFE/THE PHILLIPIAN\n**Q: What are five adjectives to describe you?**\nA: Vivacious, direct, honest, thoughtful and thick-skinned.\n**Q: What do you think is the greatest challenge Andover students currently face, and how would you seek to remedy it?**\nA: I don’t think there’s just one. That’s part of the problem. I can’t imagine being a student in this day and age, considering all of the white noise that [they] all have. It seems to me that it’s hard to gain clarity when there’s so many distractions. I don’t know if that’s the biggest challenge, but it’s certainly a major one.\nI think it’s hard to think about ways of communication when the means of communication are so stunted, and I mean that in terms of not simply communicating with adults, but communicating with each other. I think there’s very little space for that.\n**Q: What do you think the most important quality of a Dean of Students\xa0is?**\nA: It seems a pretty thankless job. I imagine, for example, that the things that you get right, people aren’t necessarily going to know, but the things that you get wrong, those are the things that people are going to remember. There’s a kind of “thick-skinned-ness” that I think one has to have [while] at the same time being sensitive to the needs of all the people that you’re trying to serve. Also, it’s not just students that you’re trying to serve, but trying to ensure that the people who are in places that they need to be in are also supported. So, that we’re all working on this common goal which is to care for [the students] all in the best way that we can.\n**Q: Why do you want to be Dean of Students?**\nA: I think in all of my roles, I have established relationships with kids and have had opportunities in the trenches, if you will, that gives me a different kind of perspective on kids. There’s a way in which sometimes people can talk about students as if they’re the only ones who know kids, and who know them really well, and that kind of language and that kind of rhetoric is a little dangerous.\xa0But I do think that I have a lot to give in having served in multiple roles and in different kinds of roles and roles that are directly linked to kids.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nWalking around campus with their hosts on Wednesday, 20 prospective students from the Prep 9 program had the chance to experience a day in the life of an Andover student. Prep 9, a program under the Prep for Prep umbrella, prepares students for placement and future success at independent schools, according to the Prep for Prep website. The program targets students coming from public schools or low socioeconomic backgrounds who wish to attend a boarding school, according to Terrell Ivory, Assistant Dean of Admission. “The main reason why we have had a great relationship with Prep is [because] they are interested in recruiting the best and brightest students… which is similar to what Andover is looking for,” said Emilyn Sosa, Assistant Dean of Admission and Coordinator of Diversity Outreach. When the students visit campus, they partake in a two-day program organized by Andover. During the visit, Prep 9 students are assigned a host student and get the chance to stay overnight in their host student’s dorm. The students participate in classes with their host and have the opportunity to meet faculty members, as well as go on tours of the campus and have an interview, according to Sosa. Starting in the sixth and seventh grades, students who want to apply to boarding schools must complete a 14-month course to prepare them for success at independent schools, according to the Prep for Prep website. “While [the] program’s goal is placing high-achieving leaders in boarding school, arriving at the decision to go away to boarding schools is many times a process. Students and families buy into the program at different times, and Prep will work with them to understand boarding as an option,” wrote Sosa in an email to The Phillipian. Last year, 15 prospective students visited campus, and seven were accepted to Andover. “Not every student is the best fit for Andover. [Prep 9] does a good job of looking at their pool of students and helping us recruit the ones they think would fit in our community,” said Sosa. Nicole Rodriguez ’17, member of Prep 9 Contingent XXVI, visited campus for the first time in November 2012 to decide if Andover was the right fit for her. “My favorite part of my visit was going to the library with my brother during study hours. It all felt so natural to me, and I could see myself doing that for the next couple of years,” said Rodriguez. When students are accepted to Andover, they are assigned a coordinator from Prep 9 that works to support the students by checking in with them regularly to make sure they are enjoying their experience and doing well academically, Sosa said. “In the past, Prep students have performed very well and we want to continue our relationship with the program because we believe students [who come] through our doors are students who deserve to be here and have taken full advantage of the opportunity,” said Sosa. Along with Andover, Prep 9 is affiliated with Choate, Deerfield, Phillips Exeter Academy, Hill, Hotchkiss, Lawrenceville, Loomis Chaffee, Middlesex, Milton, St. Andrew’s, Taft, Groton and Tabor.\n\n', 'Nov 6, 2014'), ('\nDemocrat Seth Moulton ’97 won the congressional seat in Massachusetts’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday evening.\n Moulton defeated Republican candidate Richard Tisei of Lynnfield, Mass., in the general election.

Hale Sturges joined the French Department in 1965 and taught until his retirement in 2004. During his 39 years at Andover, Sturges served as an Instructor and Chair in French and later Chair of the Language Division, Coach of Varsity Baseball and House Counselor for 22 years in Fuess House and French House. “After being a house counselor for 22 years, my dad became a surrogate father to so many boys living in the dorm… I received numerous letters and emails from former students in the past couple of weeks that really struck me his depth of influence,” said Anne Gatewood, daughter of Hale Sturges, in an interview with The Phillipian. “It was really obvious in one level that he made a difference to all these kids, but I really didn’t understand how deeply and I didn’t realize that because he never put me or my sister as anything but his first priority,” she continued. Gatewood said that family and friendship and having fun with people he loved meant the world to Sturges. “He was a really, really fun dad: he was always playing games, from scrabble to croquet to catching balls. In the classroom, he always managed to make class fun: he would jump up and down and act out things…he was some sort of a looney tune… there was always a big laugh in every class,” said Gatewood. In addition to being family-oriented, Gatewood said that her father was always a student, rather than only being a teacher. She said that his curiosity for the world inspired him to travel all over the world. “He would always try to go to new places and learn about different people and the way different people lived their lives and have an appreciation for that,” said Gatewood. “Hale Sturges was an outstanding teacher and colleague. He was always interested and caring in what other people were doing and their ideas. He also really thought about what he was doing and his philosophy in teaching,” said Natalie Schorr, former Instructor in French, in an interview with The Phillipian. During his time as the Chair of the Language Division, Sturges was a strong advocate of teaching all levels of classes entirely in the target language, creating a total immersion experience for the students, said Schorr. “Essentially the reason why he did that was because he felt that he didn’t want students to think that English was more important than other languages and wanted students to have empathy for other languages and cultures,” Schorr said. “For [Sturges], it wasn’t just about teaching the language itself. It was teaching the history, the literature, and the culture of another language,” she continued. In addition, Sturges developed the Chinese Department back when only a couple of classes were offered, by hiring more teachers and leading the first faculty trip to China. Schorr added that he even tried to learn the language himself. Outside of his teaching career, Sturges held the Beinecke Foundation Faculty Chair for 21 years and also served as President of the Cum Laude Society. He also served on the boards of the American Memorial Hospital in Reims, France. Sturges also published two French textbooks, titled “Une Fois Pour Toutes, Encore Une Fois,” and “Par Tout Le Monde Francophone,” and wrote a sociological study titled “The People of Pleure: Portrait of a French Village.” “At Andover, he cared about others and this continued during his retirement in his work with outreach programs,” said Schorr. After retiring from Andover, Sturges continued to share his love of the French language and literature through teaching at Beacon Hill Seminars, where he taught courses in French and English, in addition to serving as Vice President of the board. Furthermore, Sturges taught English as a second language to recent immigrants. Jacques Hugon, Instructor in Math, first met Sturges while staying in Andover as a Post-Graduate international exchange student. He lived with Sturges and his family in their faculty housing apartment in Fuess House for part of the year. “[Sturges] became a mentor and a friend to me ever since we met in 1978,” said Hugon in an email to The Phillipian. “He and his wife opened their home to me on countless occasions, be it Thanksgiving, Christmas or just offering friendship and support at every moment of my adult life.” Hugon said that, with his cheerful and infectious laugh, Sturges had a wonderful ability to connect with everyone around him, adults and students alike. “He was passionate about teaching and a passionate Francophile who took great pleasure in his craft, as well as the daily contact with students. He loved the classroom experience, and it showed in the enthusiasm he showed for teaching French every day. He is truly a wonderful human being, friend, and mentor. I will miss him dearly,” Hugon wrote. Sturges graduated from Milton Academy in 1956, and received his Bachelor’s from Harvard College in 1960. He began his teaching career at Middlesex School in 1960, teaching French and Latin and continued teaching French at Andover. Sturges is survived by his wife and two daughters.

He worked very hard, but you never saw it.

It requires individual precision and discipline, but it’s the type of instrument that leads everyone in a chapel or concert hall. Organists are rarely stars or virtuosos, and they have a very attuned spirituality, which in a way, may reflect something about [Moulton’s] character,” Balamaci added.\nHis former organ instructor, Carolyn Skelton, said, “[Moulton] was very thorough in his practicing and was interested in learning as much new repertoire as his time would allow.” As a final project for his AP Music Theory course, Moulton composed a set of variations on the piece “Amazing Grace.” Skelton says she has performed his composition.\nAfter graduating from Andover, Moulton received a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics at Harvard College in 2001.

She encouraged students to stand up in situations where they felt something was wrong and, by explaining the “rules of hooking up,” also laid down basic guidelines for social conduct, including the necessity of privacy in sexual relationships.\n According to Wiseman, silence can be both a good and bad thing, depending on the situation. While in some cases, silence is used to defend the privacy of relationships, in other cases it can be used to diminish others, said Wiseman. \n Wiseman cited the “Bro Code” as an example of a potentially negative form of silence. According to Wiseman, men living in cultures that encourage male impassivity often find themselves silenced.\n “‘Bro Code,’ which is supposed to be like loyalty, is actually compliance and silence… You don’t have the right to complain about things that are wrong,” said Wiseman.\n She also said that silence inhibits girls who hit puberty early. Girls who experience puberty early are often uncomfortably objectified by older boys, forcing them to cover themselves, said Wiseman.\n “The problem with girls who go through puberty earlier is that it’s really tough for them, but for boys, in some ways it can be easier… It is one of the first times that girls at early ages learn that they have to hide themselves or not be clear about what they want and what they don’t want,” she said. \n Using anecdotes involving race and ethnicity, Wiseman demonstrated how minorities can be silenced. In one example, Wiseman discussed a student who was taunted for appearing to be Jewish, but who was in fact not Jewish. \n “Boys and girls, men and women, are really good at silencing each other. But this is also where gender really comes together, because it is amazing how much we can silence boys and girls by saying certain words…. When people say, ‘Relax,’ ‘Don’t worry about it,’ ‘You’re overreacting,’ [they are using] mechanisms to silence people who have less power,” said Wiseman.\n Wiseman said that the ways in which adults teach young people on topics of relationships and social conflicts are often unrealistic. \n “Are we coming across as patronizing, or are we coming across as if we don’t know what we’re talking about? Are we actually listening to young people so that when we talk to them, we make sense?” said Wiseman in an interview with The Phillipian.\n According to Wiseman, a large problem is that many adults are still uninformed on the social conflicts that young people face on an almost daily basis, and they are unable to help students overcome such issues.\n “I still deal with heads of schools who will value the reputation of the school over the integrity and safety of its students,” she said in her presentation.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\n| \n**Meet Seth Moulton:**\n– Graduated from Harvard College in 2001 with a Bachelor’s in Physics.\n– Joined the Marine Corps and served four tours of duty in Iraq over a five-year period after leaving Harvard.\n– Received the Bronze Star Medal for valor and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal for valor.\n– Received an MPA from the John F.

The decibel levels were measured using “Decibel,” an application available on the iPhone.\n Capano said that if people at dances begin to complain about the music’s volume, the DJ will be asked to turn the music down. Often, because the DJ stands behind the speakers, he or she does not realize the volume of the music.\n “The findings [from the Latin Arts Dance] were useful in that we now have an idea of how loud the dances are as opposed to just a feeling that someone has.

The district is regarded as a battleground district, according to rollcall.com.\nMary McHugh, Instructor in Political Science at Merrimack College, explained to The Phillipian that the Democrats are currently down 34 seats in the House of Representatives, so this election is crucial if they want a chance to make up some of the seats they are missing. Republicans have a strong lead and are favored in several races, so they are less concerned about trying to gain a seat in Massachusetts and are focusing their efforts on other elections.\nThe election is too tight to give one candidate a definite lead, but McHugh said that the Democratic Party is “cautiously optimistic.”\nThe Democrats lost their consistent control of the Sixth District seat after Tierney, long-time district Congressman, became involved in a scandal. Tierney’s wife was incarcerated for one month after receiving money from her brother’s illegal gambling business, according to “The Boston Globe.” The 2012 election between Tierney and Tisei was the closest election since 1996, according to the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tisei won 47.1 percent of the votes, while Tierney won 48.3 percent of the votes, winning the 2012 race by 4,330 votes.\nTisei won by small margins in the majority of the towns in the district and made up the ground with decisive victories in the largest towns, such as Lynn, Peabody and Salem, which have historically favored the Democratic Party. The 18-year incumbent Tierney lost the 2014 Democratic Primary to Moulton, with sizeable victories in only Lynn and Gloucester. Moulton won all but five towns.

According to Elaine Crivelli, Instructor in Art and the future instructor of Art 465, the new course will focus on the modern and contemporary art of the three countries. Students in the class will explore the three cultures through various artistic media including visual art and film. “This course will travel back and forth in time while viewing a selection of artists and filmmakers from each country whose works are inspired by historic roots and cultural traditions or whose works address political unrest, human rights or cultural change,” wrote Crivelli in an email to The Phillipian. Crivelli said that the course focuses specifically on India, China and South Africa because of the significant cultural and economic changes that have recently occurred in these countries. “I was thinking specifically about the economic developments in China moving more towards capitalism and how this has impacted the contemporary art and cultural developments coming out of there. In [South Africa,] we will most likely look at apartheid and other cultural changes and conflicts that occurred and how the work of artists… reflected and addressed these issues. [For] India, we will look at developments in modern and contemporary art,” said Crivelli. “The contemporary art that is currently produced [in India, China and South Africa] reflects these [cultural] developments through bold, provocative, courageous and poetic art forms in various media,” said Crivelli. The opportunity to teach the course is a learning experience for Crivelli as well as her students. She hopes that the course will fill the current gap in the study of non-Western art and culture in the Department of Art. “The preparation for a new course is often exciting and mentally stimulating, especially when I can learn so much about art that I knew little about prior to researching material for this course,” said Crivelli.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\nIn an effort to promote healthy eating, the dining team at Paresky Commons hosted a “Farm to Fork” dinner over Family Weekend.\n The dinner featured food from eight different farms located in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and was held in the Smith Center to accommodate the large number of students and family members in attendance. \n “We knew the parents were coming and that we were going to be in this big building and we would need a streamlined menu… so it was just the perfect night to do [the Farm to Fork dinner],” said Michael Giampa, Food Service Director, who organized the event with Paul Robarge, Senior Director of Aramark, and David Rossetto, Executive Chef at Paresky.\n The menu consisted of turkey, mashed potatoes, butternut squash, pumpkin Thai curry and cranberry sauce.\n According to Giampa, the Farm to Fork initiative benefits local farms.\n “The farms are getting the prices they want to get, so it’s supporting them directly,” said Giampa.\n Andover will continue to source food from local farms such as Mann Orchards in Methuen, Mass. and Crescent Farms in Haverhill, Mass. for the rest of the year, while some of the partnerships, including the partnership with Raymond’s Turkey Farm in Methuen, Mass., were one-time partnerships and will not be continued due to the heightened cost of locally grown food.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\nBecause of cracks and overall deterioration, the Sorota Track, located adjacent to Phelps Stadium, will be resurfaced next spring for the first time since 1995.\n While the cracks in the track do not currently pose a safety hazard, the Athletic Department decided to renovate the facility in order to prevent further degradation and avoid future safety concerns, according to Casey Russo, Capital Project Manager of the Office of the Physical Plant. \n The resurfacing process will involve removing the existing synthetic blue rubber surface and asphalt, draining and soiling underneath the track and backfilling it with a suitable compact material, new asphalt and drainage, said Russo.\n “A new base and surface for the outdoor track [will be] a big boost to our program and the school,” said Corbin Lang, Co-Head Coach of Varsity Track and Field. \n The resurfacing of the track will begin in May, most likely the Monday after the Spring Andover-Exeter Day, when all sports practices and games will have ended for the school year, said Leon Modeste, Instructor and Chair in Physical Education and Athletic Director.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\nBrow furrowed in concentration, Makenna Marshall ’18 dashed three yards to kick the football, sending it flying across the field and towards the goal post. \n With one day left to change sports this fall, Marshall made the last-minute decision to venture into the male-dominated world of football when she heard her friends on the JV Football team saying that they needed a kicker. \n “I guess they were half joking and half not, but it was the last day to switch sports so I just went for it… I wanted to try something new,” Marshall said. \n Despite never having touched a football before arriving on campus, Marshall entertained the idea of playing football while practicing soccer as she saw many of her shots soaring through the football goal posts.\n Marshall’s favorite part about playing football has been the camaraderie of her team.\n “What I like best is hanging out with people who I normally don’t hang out with. After that first [away] game, we came back late, and [Paresky Commons] stayed open for us. We all sat down to eat, and people talked to me. Here I was, part of this team that I wasn’t used to,” said Marshall.\n Marshall said she received an unexpectedly positive response from the Andover community regarding her position on the team.\n “The best part is realizing [that] people will be nice and understanding no matter what you do. No one’s been like, ‘You play football?’ Everyone at Andover [has been] so accepting,” she said.\n Marshall says she hopes that she can break down some barriers concerning the limitations of girls in sports.\n “What can girls do physically? Because girls are differently shaped than guys and there is a point where sports are divided for that reason, I understand it… it all comes [down] to what we can do physically, but we should all get the same chances to try,” said Marshall.\n Marshall is currently following both her newfound interest in football and her old passion for soccer as a member of Girls JV2 Soccer. She alternates between practices for the two sports.\n Marshall hopes that she will not be asked to choose between her commitments to football and soccer, because, although she enjoys being a kicker for Football, soccer is her passion.\n “That’s my scariest thought: that I’d have to stop playing soccer. Soccer is my first true love. I plan to continue playing it. If they let me carry on with football, I will. I’d love to still be on the team,” said Marshall.\n According to Leon Modeste, Athletic Director, this rare allowance for an athlete to play two sports at once would not be possible if either sport were Varsity-level. \n Marshall said one of her funniest experiences on the football team has been accidentally cheering for the wrong team after a touchdown.\n “I forgot we were away and I heard people cheering so I thought it was for my team, so I was like ‘Go, go, touchdown!’ Everyone on my team just turns around and was like, ‘What?’ I felt so embarrassed!” she said.\n She continued, “I pulled a Charlie Brown too. The snapper (the guy who holds the football in place) didn’t pull it away, but it was raining outside. Everyone was chanting, and I slipped. The ball didn’t even go through the field goal. It went the other direction, and I fell on my butt.”\n Having never played football before, Marshall faced her first struggle alone in the girls’ locker room before her first practice. \n “I did not know how to put my helmet on. There were these tin straps prohibiting me from putting it on without snapping it, and a bunch of the guys had to come over to direct me because I didn’t know what to do,” Marshall said.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\nThe Mural Room was filled with students of a variety of ethnicities and cultures as the International Students Club (iClub) hosted a panel discussion, “An International Perspective on Race in The United States,” this past Wednesday. \n The panel featured Reim Hussein, Instructor in Biology, Caitlin Monroe, Teaching Fellow in History, Adrian Khactu, Instructor in English, Elizabeth Monroe, Instructor in History, and faculty advisor to iClub, Alessa Cross ’16, Malika Dia ’17, and Cem Vardar ’15. Each speaker shared his or her perspective on race in the US within a five-minute block, taking questions from the audience throughout.\n During her opening statement, panelist Reem Hussein, Instructor in Biology, remarked on her transition to life in the United States as a college student. \n Dia, a panelist from West Africa, discussed the vast differences between groups of Africans, in addition to differences between Africans and African-Americans, hoping that the audience would leave with more sensitivity towards both groups.\n Kim talked about the challenges of growing up bicultural, citing how he had to choose between his Korean name and his American name. \n “In both instances you speak the language of a land you’re not from,” said Kim during the panel, in describing how he could not identify with one language or culture. “It’s difficult being bicultural, trying to negotiate two different cultural identities.”\n Cross compared her experience as bicultural in Japan to that in the United States. \n “In Japan, I am both exoticized and otherized. The homogenous society back home innocuously admires me, along with many other Japanese-biracial students, for our different looks and ability to speak both English and Japanese… In addition, the perception of Asians [in the US] as some “random,” insignificant collection rather than as individuals is dehumanizing and invalidating. It makes a mixed-race person like me feel some sick form of relief– ‘well thank god I’m half white and not fully Asian,’” said Cross. \n Monroe, represented the domestic viewpoint on the panel. Monroe provided insight into the importance of history in decoding race in America. \n iClub had originally planned to host the discussion within a club meeting, but realized how an outside perspective on race could be beneficial to all students.\n “The past few years we have heard a lot about race and gender on campus, and as an international student, I noticed a disconnect between the international and domestic ??understandings of the issues,” said Emma Kukielski ‘15, Co-President of iClub, “Some [International] students even felt that their experiences weren’t being valued on campus.”\n “I hope that [people] get that [race] is both complicated and important… It takes effort and empathy to start understanding, but it’s worth it and will make everyone happier,” said Monroe in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 30, 2014'), ('\nHindu\xa0Student Union\n**By BENNETT MICHAELS**\nIn addition to celebrating the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Holi on campus, Hindu Student Union (HSU) provides support to Indian students on campus, even if they do not necessarily identify as Hindu, according to Arzu Singh ’16, Co-Head of HSU.\n“[HSU] is not so much necessarily about the faith itself because Indian culture is really heavily tied with religion, especially Hinduism.

The new position, which Griffith will assume on July 1, 2015, was created to fulfill the goals set forth in the 2014 Strategic Plan. \n “[Griffith] is the obvious and perfect person to do the work, in my opinion,” said Head of School John Palfrey. Palfrey affirmed that the previous position of Associate Head of School will not be filled and that the new role will be a hybrid of Griffith’s current responsibilities and the former duties of the Associate Head of School. \n “[The new role] is both explicitly heightening the awareness around equity and inclusion work and the prominence of it in the school, but also reallocating some of the duties among the senior administrative team,” Palfrey said. \n While her current role as Dean of CAMD mostly involves working directly with students and their organizations and clubs, her new position will enable Griffith to work both with and for the entire Andover community. \n “I’ve had a lot of ideas and support on campus for additional initiatives to support faculty, administration and staff and to work with alumni, the Development Office and trustees. The role of [Assistant Head of School for Equity and Inclusion] puts me in a position where there is visibility and the high level of support that I would truly need to work with all of those constituencies equally,” said Griffith.\n “Instead of planning the day-to-day programming, I will be helping administrators, faculty and staff reflect and ask if each aspect of the school — curriculum, athletics, theater — is an inclusive, welcoming environment,” Griffith continued.\n Griffith looks to tackle the task of analyzing the results of the Assessment of Inclusivity and Multiculturalism (AIM) Survey that will come out this spring. With the information from the survey, Griffith said that she would work with others to strategically consider how to move forward and improve Andover in such areas.\n “We are a diverse community, and our school ranks high in our commitment and value in multiculturalism. But where we lose is in inclusivity — how included do various members of the community feel?” said Griffith.\n “There’s often an expression of being invited to a table but wanting to help plan the menu too. It’s a wonderful analogy used in diversity work; people have been invited to the table, but who is planning the menu? We’re hoping to help each member of this community feel like they can put something on that table and help form it,” she continued.\n As a result of Griffith’s new appointment, a new position in the CAMD office, likely to be entitled “Associate Dean of Equity and Inclusion,” will be created. The person in this role will work directly with all student diversity programming as well as support underrepresented students of color, according to Palfrey in an email to the entire Andover community. \n “This person will take on much of the student-centered programs and report directly to me. That being said, I could never give up the intimate interaction with the students completely, so I will still work closely with some of the student organizations,” said Griffith.\n Griffith said that she hopes to work with the future Associate Dean in creating a much more conscientious and sustainable training education to develop student leaders with a lens of diversity and inclusion. Along with the Dean of Students Office, Griffith plans to train proctors and prefects around these issues. \n Although Andover has been at the forefront of initiatives related to diversity and multiculturalism for many years, there is still much work to be done, especially regarding the “Equity and Inclusion” component of the Strategic Plan, said Palfrey. \n “This feels like the right time to have someone at a significantly new level in the administrative position to oversee more or less the aspects of equity and inclusion throughout our entire community,” said Griffith.\n As a member of the Andover community for over 25 years, Griffith has served as an Instructor in English, house counselor and Dean of Pine Knoll Cluster, among other roles.\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nFollowing the lead of Graham House counselors, Reverend Anne Gardner, Director of Religious and Spiritual Life, will visit ninth-grade dorms in the next several weeks to inform Juniors of the various ways that the professional staff in Cochran Chapel can support students.\n“Over the seven years I’ve been at [Andover] as a Chaplain and a house counselor, I see that this place is a tremendous place of value, but also a tremendous place of stress and anxiety. And if there is some way that I, along with many other adults on campus, can provide some kind of support, solace and encouragement, I want to do that for the students, whether or not they are connected with a particular worship or tradition,” said Gardner.\nGardner said that she will inform students who have a particular religious tradition of all the devotional and practical ways that services are held, in addition to the ways that students can observe religious holidays on campus. Furthermore, she plans to introduce all of the different religious clubs on campus with which students can connect, including Culture, Politics, Religion (CPR) club, which is not associated with a particular faith.\nFor non-practicing students, Gardner said that she would discuss the nonreligious aspects of the Chapel.\n“For instance, I’ve been given the charge of acting on the school’s behalf to mark every important secular holiday, such as Veteran’s Day and Memorial Day. It is part of my wider charge to make sure that these moments in the calendar, whether secular or sacred, are [held] in importance and that students have the time to reflect during these moments of gravity,” said Gardner.\nGardner added that she would bring a number of upperclassmen with varying religious backgrounds to visit the ninth-grade dorms with her.\n“I don’t want people to get the notion that I’m coming as a sole representative of my own faith tradition. It’s one of the things I’ve been particularly conscientious of that as a Director. Although I belong to a particular congregation, this is me as a Director telling students the different kinds of roles the Chapel serves in the community,” said Gardner.\n“I hope that every student here can find a place in the community where they can find absolute support, whether it be through proctors, prefects, counselors or other support groups on campus. I just want to make sure that students know that the Chapel is another vehicle in which they could potentially get support,” she continued.\n\xa0\n[Read more about the history of religion at Andover in _The Phillipian_.](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/23/andover-secular-school-protestant-beginnings)\n[Read\xa0_The Phillipian_’s coverage of resources for religious support at Andover](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/24/resources-religious-support-andover), featuring Hindu Student Union, Catholic Student Fellowship, Andover Christian Fellowship, Jewish Student Union, and Muslim Student Association.\n[Also, read last week’s\xa0issue of\xa0_The Phillipian_\xa0for coverage of resources designed specifically to provide mentorship to students.](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/16/support-groups-andover)\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nThe browned sheets of the Constitution of Phillips Academy, signed by Samuel Phillips Jr. and John Phillips in 1778, declare that “the first and principal object of this Institution is the promotion of true Piety and Virtue.”\nWith the words “piety” and “virtue,” Phillips emphasized goodness in accordance with the Bible. In Frederick S. Allis Jr.’s book, “Youth from Every Quarter: A Bicentennial History of Phillips Academy, Andover,” he writes that the longstanding goal of an Andover education is to teach students “the great end and real business of living.” This idea refers in part to Andover’s beginnings as an institution rooted in Protestant ideology and teaching.\n“The object in educating youth ought to be to qualify young persons as ornaments, as blessings and as comforts in the vineyard of the Lord…. All [the instructor’s] views will be to inspire his pupils with that knowledge which will influence them to remember their Creator in the days of their youth,” wrote Phillips in a letter to Eliphalet Pearson, Andover’s first Head of School.\nIn the centuries following the constitution’s ratification, Andover slowly began to move away from its religious grounding. Now, Andover is not affiliated with a specific religion. In The Phillipian’s 2014 “State of the Academy” survey, 41.6 percent of participants identified as agnostic or atheist. Although religion still plays an integral role in campus life for many students, the school’s institutional emphasis on religion is far more relaxed.\n**FOUNDING OF THE SCHOOL**\nDespite its calling for “youth from every quarter,” Andover, referred to as a “seminary” in its constitution, mandated that all instructors, Head of Schools and trustees be Protestant.\nTo prevent the school from becoming too sectarian, the constitution also mandated that the majority of trustees be laymen, according to “An Old New England School” by Claude Moore Fuess, Andover’s tenth Head of School.\nFor students in the late 1700s, school would begin every day with a psalm reading and end every night with a hymn and prayer. On Sundays, the school would travel to the Old South Church, a church in the town of Andover. On Mondays, students would then be quizzed on the sermons they had learned at church that week.\n**ANDOVER\xa0THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY**\nIn 1808, the Andover Theological Seminary was formed to train clergy, occupying parts of what is now Flagstaff Cluster.\nAlthough separate from Andover, Allis Jr. offers a description of the Theological Seminary in “Youth from Every Quarter.”\n“It is not too much to say that the Seminary was the most important single influence on the school,” he writes.\nResponsibility of the Seminary was placed upon the Trustees of Andover, which, writes Allis, “soon began to demand a disproportionate amount of their time and energy, the School and its problems being forced to take a back seat.”\n**RELIGIOUS\xa0REQUIREMENTS\xa0REDUCED**\nReligious requirements began to ease off under Head of School Cecil Bancroft in the late 19th century. By 1876, students were permitted to attend Sunday church services in the town of Andover, as opposed to service at Andover’s chapel. In 1878, to encourage a more genuine interest in religion, Bancroft made Monday, Wednesday and Saturday religious services and meetings voluntary.\nAfter the Theological Seminary moved to Newton, Mass., in 1908, the school hired Reverend Markham Stackpole as the school’s first minister. Once hired, Stackpole introduced a mandatory Bible course for Lowers.\n“In the present generation, it has become increasingly evident that the schools must provide for the study of the Bible as literature. One does not need to argue in these days … [the] Bible is essential to culture,” wrote Stackpole.\nFrom the beginning of his tenure and through the late 1950s, Head of School Dr. Alfred E. Stearns instituted brief chapel services six days a week for students.\n**STUDENTS\xa0QUESTION\xa0OBLIGATION OF DAILY CHAPEL**\nIn 1956, an article appeared inside _The Phillipian _entitled “Student Conference Decides Faith is Necessary for Intellectual Freedom.” The article argued against an article from Exeter’s newspaper, “The Exonian,” which claimed that mandated religious scholarship inhibits intellectual freedom.\n“It would be silly to exclude religion in any interpretation of history, literature and art,” _The Phillipian_ article reads.\nThis article was followed by another in 1959 reporting on a Philomathean Society forum on the idea of enforced religious courses dissuading students from understanding the true meaning of religion.\n“Weekly Poll Finds Students Against Mandatory Chapel,” blared the front page of the October 19, 1960 edition of _The Phillipian_.\n“As a minister in this academic community, I am a bewildered and torn person.… The purpose of worship in its shortest definition is ‘to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.’ This is not happening at [Andover] or at other schools.… Scruff-of-the-neck respect for the sacred or for others is not respect at all,” wrote James R. Whyte, who became a minister at Andover in 1966, in a handout distributed for the faculty before their discussion regarding religious reformations on campus.\n“[Andover] has always declared its concern for the education of the whole men, and thus it would seem that part of its educational program must address itself to questions concerning the realm of spirit,” disagreed another essay in the same paper.\nAfter the removal of Wednesday’s required chapel on May 7, 1971, compulsory Sunday service was abolished.\n\xa0\nTRIPARTITE MINISTRY\nIn recognition of the growing diversity of campus, Head of School Theodore Sizer’s administration instituted a tripartite ministry, encompassing a Protestant chaplain, a Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi, in 1976. The system lasted until 2007, when, under Head of School Barbara Chase, a committee formed again to review the topic of religion at Andover.\nThe committee met to review the present makeup of the chaplaincy and evaluate the larger necessity of support for the spiritual lives of all Andover students.\nReverend Ann Gardner was hired as the inaugural “Director of Spiritual and Religious Life at Phillips Academy” to meet these needs. The title was specifically chosen to include people that fell outside of the tripartite boat.\n“[The committee] realized that not only are there people outside of the judeo-christian model, but there are also people that have no affiliation with any kind of religious tradition. [These people still] struggle with the meta questions. [The committee wanted to] create different kinds of vehicles by which people would be able to… grapple with these larger questions,” said Gardner in an interview with The Phillipian.\n[Read more about the religious support groups at Andover.](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/23/religious-support-andover)\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nDonning a navy suit and an Andover tie, Oscar Tang ’56 took the stage in front of a collection of trustees, faculty, administrators and students at the official launch of the Tang Institute at Andover on Friday in Tang Theatre.\nTang donated $15 million to fund the base grant for the Tang Institute, which addresses issues of access to resources at Andover and how these resources can be made available to students beyond campus.\nOriginally named the Andover Institute, the organization was recently changed to the Tang Institute at Andover as a result of Tang’s financial and personal commitment to the Institute’s goal of educational outreach, according to Peter Currie ’74, President of the Board of Trustees.\n“Given [Tang]’s aspirations for Andover to be the private school with a public purpose and given how neatly that maps to what the Institute is doing, I can’t imagine a more fitting tribute to [Tang] than to put his name on it,” said Currie.\nAccording to Currie, Tang joined the project in the spring of 2014 and helped lift it off the ground. At that point, the Tang Institute had been in the developmental phase for around a year.\n“[Tang] really understood what the goal was. [He] got excited enough to really give it the boost it needed to get off the ground,” said Currie.\nRegarding the goals of the Tang Institute, Currie talked about the constantly developing nature of both the Tang Institute and Andover as a school.\n“I think the goal of the Institute is not an end state — there’s not a thing, there’s not a conquering moment, there’s not a moment of victory. If the Institute can create a culture of experimentation, … that process will be a total victory,” said Currie.\nThe Tang Institute will channel its resources, including the grant from Tang, into a variety of programs that will help facilitate learning and innovation both on and off campus.\nThese programs include the nearly completed Khan Academy BC Calculus course, the development of an astronomy web portal for star discoveries and many other experimental initiatives across campus.\nAlthough Andover plans to launch new initiatives under the umbrella of the Tang Institute, some of the projects affiliated with the Tang Institute have already been in existence for years.\n“[The Tang Institute] is a process of innovation, it’s a process of learning and it’s actually a cultural phenomenon that’s not foreign to the school, but we’re just organizing it a bit differently than it’s been organized before,” said Currie.\n\xa0\n[Read\xa0_The Phillipian_\xa0Q&A with Oscar Tang.](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/23/qa-oscar-tang)\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nDr. Llana Barber, historian and author, stood before the audience in front of a large black and white photo depicting laughing, Latino youth holding a fake television camera.

The photograph set the scene for Barber’s presentation, “Immigration and Urban Crisis in Lawrence.”\n In her presentation, which took place last Friday, Barber painted a picture of a rich and vibrant city marred by an unfortunate history of racial tensions and scarcity of resources. \n “Latinos in Lawrence were blamed for the city’s crisis, even though the roots of the city’s crisis… began decades began before substantial Latino settlement,” said Barber. \n “The two most important developments in the second half of the 20th century were suburbanization — and the impact suburbanization had on urban economies — and immigration from Latin America,” she said.\n After the Great Depression, government initiatives to depopulate the crowded and dirty cities began to move people out of urban areas to buy large, single-family homes in the suburbs. Seeing opportunity in the cheap and plentiful land in the suburbs, cities began to deindustrialize as companies built manufacturing centers in suburban locations, Barber said. \n The deindustrialization of and disinvestment in the city eventually led to an urban crisis. As people began to leave the city, the once prosperous Lawrence stagnated, while the suburbs gained wealth and prosperity, said Barber. \n The next 30 years also saw a sharp increase in the Latino population coming from territories and countries such as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a result of the negative effects of U.S. involvement in their home countries, according to Barber. \n Fleeing the problems of their own countries in search of jobs, many Latinos settled in vacated cities like Lawrence. Their presence brought new life to the city, according to Barber.\n “Latinos filled [Lawrence’s] streets with small business and restaurants and filled its parks with playing chil dren…. It’s a vibrant city now; there’s music, people are laughing, people are talking, people are in the streets, men playing dominos in the commons,” said Barber.\n Due to the disinvestment and economic downturn Lawrence experienced, however, most jobs that Latinos held in Lawrence were short lived. By 1990, 25 percent of Latinos living in Lawrence were unemployed, according to Barber. \n “For those who had jobs, those jobs were generally ones that offered very little social mobility. It wasn’t ‘work’ hard and maybe you’ll become a manager some day’; it was more like ‘work hard and work until you die, and if you’re lucky, they’ll bury you,’” said Barber.\n This lack of social mobility was partially due to an absence of quality education in Lawrence, as schools were underfunded and overcrowded as a result of disinvestment in the city. Classrooms often had leaky roofs and did not have any textbooks. Due to this failure in the public-education system, Lawrence crime rates went up and the city could not offer the opportunities necessary for success in the modern day. \n Barber’s presentation was based on her project, “Latino City: Immigration and Urban Crisis in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1945-2000,” which focuses on suburbanization, urban economic decline and immigration in the city of Lawrence.\n “I became interested in Lawrence when I heard about the riots [of the 1980s], when I had spent some time there and when I saw the kind of racial tension and prejudice that existed in the city,” said Barber. \n Barber’s visit to Andover was organized by Alianza Latina, a Latin-culture club on campus.\n “I hoped that [people] would see Lawrence [through the presentation] as a city that has what every other urban city has. [At the moment], the way that we see Lawrence as a community is not [in] an amazing way. We look at Lawrence as the poor town right next to Andover where we do community service,” said Isabella Oliva ’16, Co-Head of Alianza Latina.\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\n **What prompted you to donate $15 million to the base grant for the Tang Institute?**\nI think that [Andover has] worked a lot on the whole idea of access. The need-blind initiative, where we admit students without regard to their financial need and so forth, is one example. That addresses access to the basic residential program, but we are a very privileged institution in terms of the program we have here and the wealth of intellectual talent that the faculty possesses.\nI think it’s important that we make that available to not only ourselves but to others in the country [and] in the world. And, in so doing, we’ll gain so much back in terms of what we also learn from outside, and I think that will also improve our own program. So it’s a combination of what it will do for us but also the obligation to make what we have available to the rest of the world.\nMany of these ideas have been in the works for many years at Andover, but, until [Head of School] John Palfrey came in, we couldn’t quite get them all put together into this initiative, and so I’m really excited that this is happening now. I think that the changes in technology and in the whole globalization that’s going on provide us with a great opportunity to have really tremendous impact.\n**How will the Tang Institute plan on making what we have available at Andover available to other students?**\nI’ll give you an example of an old outreach program: MS2. [That] is really pedagogy that we have had for a long time, which we have made available to talented students from really disadvantaged schools.\n[Andover is] experimenting with improving the program using technology to stay in touch with these students during the regular school year, as opposed to when they are here for the three summers. We’re also exploring through the Tang Institute whether this can be scaled up in other ways.\nThat’s an old program, but the new ideas — for example, what we’re doing with the Khan Academy, where we’re basically supplying the curriculum and all the exercise problems of the BC Calculus curriculum for Khan Academy, where these are being used by hundreds of thousands of students all over the world — are beginning explorations.\nAnother part of the Tang Institute is really the goal of the school that each student here should have an equal opportunity to participate in one of the “Learning in the World” programs, such as Niswarth or programs in South Africa, Brazil, China, etc.\nThis is a very costly effort because it’s also our philosophy that, if we make this part of the regular curriculum, we must provide the support for many of the students who otherwise would not be able to take advantage of such a program, so that is a goal. I don’t know if we can get there, but that will be part of the Tang Institute as well.\n\xa0\n[Read more on\xa0_The Phillipian_’s coverage of the Tang Institute.](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/10/23/tang-institute-officially-launches)\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nWhen Devontae Freeland ’15 learned of the Spanish gitanos, a nomadic ethnic group from Spain, in his Spanish 400 class, he was struck by the similarities between the experience of the gitanos in Spain and African Americans in the United States, he said.\n “Within the Spanish government, only one gitano has been elected as member of the Parliament since the 1970s,” said Freeland last Friday in his Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar presentation, which was entitled “A Comparative Study of the Socio-Politics of African Americans and Spanish Gitanos during the Post-Civil Rights and Post-Francoist Era.”\n Spanish gitanos, also known as “gypsies” or “Roma,” belong to a nomadic tribe that settled in Barcelona, Spain, 567 years ago as a result of a diaspora extending all throughout Europe following the group’s exodus from the Hindu Kush mountains of India. Currently, 15 percent of gitanos are illiterate and 80 percent drop out of school. Furthermore, gitanos who have attained a decent standard of living have again fallen into poverty and exclusion, according to Freeland.\n “The statistics of African Americans in the United States today are also startling,” said Freeland. African-American infants have the highest mortality rate and are twice as likely to live in poverty as non- African-American families nationwide, according to Freeland. \n Last summer, while traveling in Madrid, Spain, Freeland said he was able to observe public perceptions of gitanos in the community, whom he said are generally seen as nearly invisible and poverty-stricken. Although his main purpose of visit was not to conduct research, Freeland said that he was subconsciously examining and making observations throughout his trip. \n As African Americans lived under severe oppression for first half of the 20th century, the Spanish gitanos also suffered under the rise of antiziganism in Spain, a term that refers to hostility, prejudice and discrimination directed against the Roma people, according to Freeland. \n Freeland said that discrimination against women as another socio-political disparity that further underscored the ties between African Americans and Spanish gitanos. \n “Mainstream depictions serve to promulgate negative stereotypes of gitana women, and African-American women have been subject to similar portrayals as hypersexual. As such, these women of color face both facets of discrimination in their societies, and acknowledgment of their existence at this intersection is all too infrequent,” he said. \n Freeland said he hopes to inform others about the disparities and existence of these minority groups as well as to encourage Andover students to critically look at issues of discrimination in the world through his presentation. \n “[It is important] to be able to look at these things and make opinions about it. Therefore, students can go out into the world with whatever professions they pursue and do something about it,” he said in an interview with The Phillipian. \n “I highlight those who share [the] dream of socio-political equity for all, regardless of race, color or creed. The inalienable rights of humankind are inherent in our human dignity. It’s rare, [and] there’s very little work out there, so I guess it’s my duty to continue working,” he continued.\n Freeland’s presentation was the second of a series of CAMD Scholar presentations this year.\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nContinuing last spring’s conversation surrounding the approval of a new room-visiting policy, Student Council held a panel discussion on Sunday for faculty and students concerning room visiting and sex education at Andover.\n The panel, which took place in the Mural Room of Paresky Commons, focused primarily on the education of teachers and house counselors regarding sex education and talks about room visiting. Student and faculty panelists alike also called for more action concerning the new room-visiting policies.\n In an attempt to bring together faculty and students on the controversial topic of room-visiting policy, both faculty and students participated in the panel.

I feel really strongly… kids need to hold themselves and each other to higher standards in terms of the way that they engage with each other,” said Elliott.\n Some students felt that the room-visiting policy proposed by the faculty did not solve the larger problem of room visiting and sex education as a whole.\n “Changing the policy to an open-door, lights-on policy for the sake of maintaining a comfortable environment for faculty… is ignoring the fact that these faculty members have chosen to work on a residential campus as a house counselor,” said Uria.\n The low faculty turnout at the forum drew criticism from some panelists.\n “I was hoping there would be faculty there so that we could get a sort of dialogue going about how students aren’t going to be comfortable with the ideas of safety, responsibility [and] maturity in terms of sexual intimacy until they can trust their house counselors,” said Tully.\n\n', 'Oct 23, 2014'), ('\nCreated early last Spring, the Sisterhood is a campus group that offers underrepresented women of color mentorship, along with the opportunity to discuss and explore their experiences at Andover.\n“[The Sisterhood] creates a community that caters to the hardships and triumphs of being an underrepresented woman of color at Andover,” said Alex Thomas ’15, a member of the Sisterhood’s board.\n“It’s essential that underrepresented girls of color at Andover have a place to share their experiences with people who can directly relate.

We might go to an athletic event in town, or we might order a particular type of food in order to try a new food experience,” Griffith said.\nEach new book that Outliers reads is given to the members of the club to read on their own time. Once or twice a term, Outliers meets to discuss the books and how they relate to socioeconomic class.\n“We are trying to create affirmation that would help students not have shame. Part of the group is to do some education around class … and it’s to give the students awareness, affirmation and pride in recognizing what they’ve been able to achieve despite coming from meager means,” Griffith said.\nEach year, Outliers sponsors a “Career Exposure Weekend” in the spring, taking club members to New York to visit the offices of big corporations. Alumni also give mock interviews and students prepare resumés to experience the process of applying for jobs, according to Griffith.\n“Cultural capital is what you know. Social capital is who you know.

I know we can control lots of things that we put in front of you and having nice buildings and so on and so forth. The one thing I can’t do for you is make sure you all are getting the help that you need,” said Palfrey. Palfrey said that the effectiveness of Andover’s mental health resources relies upon the community’s willingness and effort to deconstruct the stigma surrounding mental health and make it comfortable for any student to seek help. “I’ve been to see a therapist many times in my life. I think there is a huge sense of stigma that people who are high-functioning don’t actually reach out and get the help that they need,” said Palfrey. Prompted by a recent case of sexual assault at peer school St. Paul’s and the recent adoption of an affirmative consent policy in Stowe House, a dorm on campus, Palfrey then shifted focus to discuss the issue of sexual assault and consent at Andover. “I think it comes down to the question of what consent means. So I would like all of us to think about, and I’m not making this rule here, but just think about what do you mean when two people consent to have some kind of intimate relationship or an intimate moment,” said Palfrey. The residents of Stowe House wrote a Letter to the Editor in last week’s edition of The Phillipian, explaining their new policy and suggesting that the school move forward to adopt an affirmative consent policy similar to the law passed in California. The current Massachusetts legal definition of sexual assault states that “sexual assault is often more broadly defined as any sexual activity that is forced or coerced or unwanted.” The definition does not, however, clarify what constitutes “unwanted” sexual activity. The bill passed in California, SB 967, defines consent as “affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity” by requiring all schools that receive public funding to adopt such a standard, according to an article by NBC. “Whether this is what you might call a hook-up or might be something longer term, I think that the standard that the students who are in Stowe House have set, which is ‘yes means yes,’ is actually a really good idea,” said Palfrey. Palfrey then announced his intent to publish his own sleep statistics online to encourage Andover students to get more sleep. Palfrey hopes to inspire a competition around who can get the most sleep through publishing, data from information gathered by a sleep-tracking band. Students will then have to sleep more than Palfrey to compete for prizes that are yet to be determined. “I work very hard, and I know you work very hard, but I’m hoping that I may encourage some of you to start a good process of focus, even for a short while, on getting more sleep than I do, ” said Palfrey.\n\n', 'Oct 16, 2014'), ('\nAfter ten consecutive summers of immersing students in Indian culture, the Niswarth program will take a hiatus in 2015. Rajesh Mundra, Director of Niswarth, made the decision to cancel the trip for a year in order to reflect on the experiences of previous years in India. No specific incident prompted the suspension of the program for the upcoming summer, according to Mundra. “I want to take some time to document what we have learned. I want to reconnect with Niswarth [alumni], interview Niswarth partners, reflect on what has gone well and our challenges and connect different themes,” Mundra said in an email to The Phillipian. Catherine Tousignant, Instructor in English and a faculty member who has been part of Niswarth for the past four years, said, “It is extremely challenging to work the full-time jobs we have here, and plan next year’s program, and take a breather to reflect on the design of the program. Planning needs to start literally the day we get back. There’s not enough time to kind of think about the program and reflect on its design, if they’re going in six months.” Niswarth is a summer program that takes students to Mumbai for three weeks during the summer to engage in projects that deal with urban development and education in India. According to its mission statement, Niswarth focuses on digging into the complexity of pressing issues within various communities from multiple perspectives. Thea Rossman ’15, who went on the trip for two consecutive years, expressed that the most valuable part of her Niswarth experience was learning to look at issues from multiple perspectives. “One day we would be meeting people in a government school, the next, at the most expensive private school in Mumbai, and, that evening, in a skyscraper at a huge educational consulting firm. I think it’s sad that the opportunity I was lucky enough to have won’t be available for many of this year’s Uppers,” Rossman said.\n\n', 'Oct 16, 2014'), ('\nRiding around Boston in 2011 with a trailer full of food scraps attached to his bicycle, Andy Brooks, Founder of Bootstrap Compost, collected 16 buckets of food waste to be converted into compost. After nearly four years, Brooks and his team now collect over 150 buckets of food waste a day from businesses and homes. The Clutch Collaborative invited Brooks to speak about the process of starting Bootstrap Compost and the effect his work has had on the Boston community Wednesday night. After leaving his previous job of ten years at Harvard University as a sports reporter, Brooks began working in various restaurants, discovering how food scraps were being wasted every day. It was during this time that he conceived the idea of Bootstrap Compost. “To be honest, I wasn’t thinking about the obstacles in front of me, I just started the business, and now it has become something that people rely on, and now I’m in charge of payrolls … All of a sudden I’m the manager. I try to be the best manager I can be,” said Brooks. Founded in 2011, Bootstrap Compost is a residential and commercial service that collects organic waste from homes and corporations, sends it to farms to be turned into compost and returns the compost to the homes and corporations that the waste came from. According to the Bootstrap Compost website, their mission is to harness the potential of organic leftovers and give back to the community what Bootstrap Compost borrows from the community. Not only does Bootstrap Compost keep waste from makings its way into landfills, but it also rewards corporations and families that subscribe to the service by returning to them nutrient-rich compost. “You drop it off at the farm, and then we extract the finished compost and give it back to the subscribers. So as a customer, you are not just getting rid of stuff, you are receiving finished compost after six months,” Brooks said. According to Brooks, although composting may seem like a novel concept, historical evidence of composting can be traced back to Roman civilization. Composting had not lost popularity until recently, and Bootstrap Compost is meant to support and further the compost movement. A benefit of Bootstrap Compost is the fact that farmers can conserve water because compost retains water more efficiently than soil, the impact of food waste on climate change is decreased and landfills are rendered obsolete, according to Brooks. “Compost also helps with the soil structure. Different sized pellets and different sized material gets mixed into the soil and it allows for variation, and it allows for worms to do their thing,” said Brooks.

When people asked me, as adults inexplicably want to do, what I want to be when I grow up, I told them, ‘I want to be a boy,’” said Myers during his presentation.\n Because the term “transgender” was novel in 1995, Myers had to explain repeatedly exactly who he was to his peers at Exeter and Harvard, a process he described as both “exhausting” and “rewarding.”\n He said, however, that these repeated explanations were the things that helped to break down the walls of the preconceived gender binary. He said, “I’m most comfortable when I can be out as transgender.”\n He added that before he began to identify as transgender, he was titled a “pushy” female, a title which would eventually change to a “timid” man.\n “It is really amazing to walk the world as a man after having walked it as a woman. It’s the feeling of getting space around you when you want it, of not necessarily being intimidated or afraid to walk in certain places where I probably wouldn’t have wanted to be when I was a woman,” said Myers.\n “Myers’s talk on Friday was a breath of fresh air for the Andover campus. He managed to weave together insights about identity, institutions and history, all while disarming us with extremely useful information, vocabulary, humor and a vision for the future,” said Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English, in an email to The Phillipian. \n “We put the ‘T’ at the end of ‘LGBT,’ and it often gets ignored. We realize now that the idea of gender fluidity and transgender issues aren’t addressed enough. So we say it’s time for us to bring a speaker who can speak about being transgender,” said Devontae Freeland ’15, board member of the Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), the organization that brought Myers to campus. \n Myers’s new book, “Revolutionary,” about his ancestor Deborah Samson, who disguised herself as a man to fight in the Revolutionary War, was published this past January. \n Discussing issues of sexual identity and acceptance at Andover, students participated in a panel discussion on queer life in the public lens, the second event of GSA Weekend, on Saturday afternoon.\n Alex Myers PEA ’96, David Gardner, Instructor in English and LGBT Advisor, Grace Tully ’15, Jaleel Williams ’15 and AJ Augustin ’15 addressed various campus issues, such as the heteronormativity of the parietal system, through the lense of an LGBT member of the community.\n The idea of making Andover a better environment for members of the LGBTQ community was one of the most recurrent topics throughout the panel. Myers specifically praised organizations like GSA for providing safe places which students can use as resources.\n Panelists also discussed the apparent fetishizing of LGBTQ status on campus.\n “A lot of times for visibly queer people, they stick out in the crowd and there is a notoriety to that. Girls who I’m not really friends with will come up to me and talk to me about clothing and say, ‘Your thigh-highs are so cute’ or ‘I have those shorts,’ and I’m fine with that… but I feel like it’s a big deal to them,” said Williams.\n The panel went on to discuss the Andover community’s response to the LGBTQ community. While the safe and accepting community at Andover was praised, panelists highlighted the faculty’s lack of initiative when it came to LGBTQ acceptance.\n “The house counselors are glad to help facilitate and hold spaces for progression with feminism and queerness, but they themselves don’t really have that agenda all the time. I think what’s really missing is actual initiative,” said Williams.\n “I feel like I’ve found faculty that actually care about [my transgender identity]… [but] I don’t think visible queerness is dealt with very well; I feel like it’s more tolerated than anything,” said Augustin.\n “We’re here, we’re queer, we’re not going anywhere,” chanted the crowd, all clad in rainbow apparel and neon glowsticks. Bearing the LGBTQ pride flag in stride, AJ Augustin ’15 led the way for GSA’s second annual pride parade on Saturday.\n In order to clearly link the parade to the GSA dance held afterwards, the masses of enthusiastic students and faculty made their rounds of campus during the evening, as opposed to last year’s daytime event.\n “[The parade] led into the dance and had people already amped [upon arrival],” said Anna Krakowsky ’15, a board member of GSA. “Last year, the weather was horrible so it was kind of glum during the day, and we had hoped that a nighttime event would increase the likelihood of favorable weather.”\n Nearly 100 students, faculty and guests from Choate participated in the parade. “We’re hoping to get more and more people to join the parade to show that the whole community is behind the group of LGBTQ people,” said Julian Otis ’16, a GSA board member. \n GSA started the parade last year to commemorate the club’s 25th anniversary at Andover. Since then, its mission has been to provide support and enthusiasm for the LGBTQ community.\n “We wanted everyone to know we are out and proud, and we wanted to beckon closeted LGBT members of the community to come out and join the lively queer community we have on campus,” wrote Devontae Freeland ’15, a board member of GSA, in an email to The Phillipian. \n Pierce Bausano, Alice Ballard-Rossiter and Harper North contributed reporting.\n\n', 'Oct 16, 2014'), ('\nPeering over artifacts from Andover’s past, students learned about the history of the Phillips family in a Libraries, Archives, Museums (LAMs) event titled “Meet the Phillipses,” in the Mural Room of Paresky Commons on Tuesday.\n The workshop, contained exhibits from the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Robert S. Peabody Museum, the Archives, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) and the Collection of Arts and Antiques, was intended to introduce students to the historical resources on campus. While the lunch focused mostly on Samuel Phillips and his wife, Phoebe Foxcroft Phillips, students also had the chance to examine artifacts from a recent archaeological dig on campus. \n As part of the workshop, the Archives exhibited construction debris discovered during an archaeological dig at the site of the Phillips Mansion House, located across Main Street from the Memorial Bell Tower. The mansion house burned down in 1887 after serving as an inn and dorm.\n “We were interested in having themes that would highlight as many institutions as possible… and also themes that we thought might be of interest to students and teachers,” said Paige Roberts, Director of the Archives and Special Collections.\n The actual excavation of the mansion was completed by both students and faculty over Grandparent’s Weekend in 2013. The focus was on finding evidence of adjacent buildings in the areas surrounding the Mansion House.\n “The goal of the excavation was to locate the foundation of the house, if possible. Old campus maps gave us an idea of where to look, but the landmarks have changed so much since the house burned down that it was not immediately apparent where the foundation would be,” wrote Marla Taylor, Collections Manager of the Peabody Museum, in an email to The Phillipian. \n The Addison presented an 18th-century teapot owned by the Phillips family, engraved with various elements from the Foxcroft coat of arms. This teapot is said to be the same teapot used to serve George Washington when he had tea with the Phillips family, according to Nile Blunt, Instructor in History and coordinator of Andover’s Collection of Arts and Antiques.\n According to Taylor, LAMs hopes to pool the resources of the Addison, the Peabody, the OWHL and the archives on campus to let students, faculty and staff realize the available resources that can be incorporated into classes.\n “Whether it’s the Collection of Arts and Antiques or the Archives or the OWHL or the [Addison] or the [Peabody], we want to make sure that people can get a sense of the kinds of objects, the kinds of documents that are in these collections and really learn from them, understand them, see them and interact with them in some ways,” said Blunt.\n “I think living [at Andover] is a really extraordinary privilege, and so learning more about it and finding the resources to know more about it is really important… I think education about the history of the school itself and the objects that really tell the story of the school is really important,” he continued.\n\n', 'Oct 16, 2014'), ('\nAfter her friend’s children were injured in a car accident involving a distracted driver, Wendy Cogswell, Community Relations Officer at Phillips Academy Public Service, realized the dangers of distracted driving. In an effort to help Andover students become more aware of this safety risk, Cogswell has organized to bring Distractology, a simulator that teaches the importance of safe driving, to campus from October 13 to October 17. The driving simulation system will be located in a trailer between Samuel Phillips Hall and Morse Hall. The inside of the trailer mimics a car, with a steering wheel in front of the driver and computer screens surrounding the driver. The screens play an interactive video that is similar to a video game. “[Distractology is] a great wake-up call. I’ve taken the program myself and it’s scary. It will wake you up. It will make you understand how texting and driving can hurt you, can hurt your friends and your family,” said Cogswell. Over 500,000 crashes in the United States result from distracted drivers each year, according to the Distractology website. Cogswell worked with Arbella, the insurance company behind Distractology, to create a 30-minute session in which a trainer will guide students through the simulator. The screens will mimic situations that might occur during actual driving, like drifting into different lanes while texting or being unable to come to a sudden stop because of looking down at a cell phone. Students will be told when to use their cell phones and when to resume focus on the road. The point of the planned distraction is to demonstrate how small moments of distraction can lead to great risk. “Being an independent school, our schedule is a little different than a public school. We really had to work together with Arbella to get [Distractology] here, and we’re very lucky we have them here,” said Cogswell.

She will also oversee capital support, used for the renovation and construction of buildings, as well as endowment support.\n In her new position, Cherubini hopes to team up with her colleagues in the Office of Academy Resources (OAR) to better understand what motivates alumni and parents to donate to Andover.\n “I think it will be really [important] to integrate myself into the culture and learn about what it is that keeps alumni connected…. There has to be things about the experience that [alumni] reflect on and are the reasons why they remain involved with the organization,” said Cherubini.\n According to Cherubini, working at both the secondary school level and the college level at Cushing and Boston College has given her a unique understanding of the campus atmosphere, and she hopes that her experience will help her fulfill her duty at Andover.\n “The most critical thing for me about this opportunity was the school is committed to its initiative… its mission, and its students,” said Cherubini.\n The search process to find a new Director of Development began with Thomas Lockerby, Secretary of the Academy. As the Head of the OAR, Lockerby met with members of the faculty and the administration to select someone to fill the position. \n After creating a list of candidates from a pool of people whose work he was familiar with, Lockerby narrowed down the options based on criteria such as leadership, skill and experience.\n “[Cherubini] met all of the criteria in terms of the independent school experience… She’s worked very well directly with donors, who are both alumni and parents, and she is someone who I know to be an excellent strategist as well as leader and manager,” Lockerby said.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2014'), ('\nAfter two years of planning, Head of School John Palfrey and Kevin Graber, Associate Dean of Admission, signed an agreement on October 1 with Keio University in Tokyo, Japan, that will bring one Keio high school student to Andover each year to join the Senior class, beginning in fall 2015. Keio University is the oldest institute of higher education in Japan; it also has affiliated schools from elementary to high school, and graduates of the Keio high schools often attend the university. According to Jim Ventre ’79, Dean of Admission, Andover currently has four students from Japan. Ventre added that, although Andover received applications from students from 86 different countries for admission to the 2014-2015 academic year, the Office of Admission felt that Japan was only mildly represented. “What we had hoped to do with this agreement was to secure a regular cultural addition in our Asian and Asian-American community. There wasn’t representation regularly in our student body from Japan, and that, we felt, was a gap in our opportunities for kids,” said Ventre. As part of the process of finalizing the agreement, members of the Andover and Keio University faculty have visited each other’s campuses to meet with members of their administration. “We would visit [Japan], and students would apply, and we would have no one whom we felt we could admit because their English literacy was not consistent with the demands of our curriculum… the kids were unbelievable, we just don’t have the capacity to offer English as a second language,” said Ventre. The idea for the partnership first came up several years ago. “When Palfrey first became Head of School, a member of our board of trustees named Scott Mead introduced Palfrey to a friend of his who is basically on the board of Keio University,” said Ventre. Ventre said that, because Keio University is a highly regarded institution in Japan, Palfrey thought that the quality of their students could match the value structure of Andover. As part of the partnership, Keio University will encourage three to five students to apply to go to Andover for their Senior year, and Andover will accept one of the students. “So [Keio University] is going to filter [the applicants] for us, which is sort of important because the major obstacle is training in writing and speaking English,” said Ventre. According to Ventre, Andover has the same English literacy standards for international students as Harvard College does for admission to its Freshman class. This literacy standard is defined as a Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score of at least 100 out of 120 points. To help the student acclimate to life at Andover, part of the agreement requires the student to attend Summer Session before starting his or her Senior year. “We have an arrangement with Summer Session to allow for students to enhance their English literacy skills. Its primary purpose is to provide a smooth transition for that student, which we felt was important,” said Ventre. Ventre emphasized that, although Andover hopes to have a long-term partnership with Keio University, the agreement will be evaluated on a year-by-year basis. “Andover actually is not in the business of signing contracts for quotas of students or long term agreements…. It’s important that both the folks at Keio and the folks at Andover are in agreement in order to foster the long term relationship and potential… we’ve agreed that we will hold one spot for a student from Keio for next September,” said Ventre. In an email to The Phillipian, Ventre wrote that Keio University will cover all costs for the student including tuition and travel expenses. This cost will total approximately $50,000 for one year. Andover has already formed partnerships with schools in other countries as well, according to Ventre, including the Kingdom of Bahrain and South Africa.\n\n', 'Oct 9, 2014'), ('\nAfter a summer of studying synthetic biology at the University of Chicago, Emma Taylor-Brill ’16 plans to transfer her enthusiasm to Andover by forming a team this fall to compete in iGEM, a high school competition in the field. Four to six members will form the team that will participate in iGEM, which stands for the “International Genetically Engineered Machine” competition. The team is challenged to use biological parts to design and build biological systems that operate in living cells, according to the competition’s website. Once she gathers enough students to form a small team, Taylor-Brill plans to discuss a project for the group to take on, which they will showcase at the yearly iGEM Jamboree in Cambridge, Mass., next May. “There are so many things that could be done with synthetic biology. For example, a couple of years ago, a team from Cambridge took DNA from a firefly and made it into ‘BioBrick’ that could be used in E.Coli to make them grow,” said Taylor-Brill. Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology, will advise Andover’s iGEM team. “Collaboration is central to success in the sciences, and this new team offers students a chance to work together to produce something new. By working so closely as a team, all the students will improve their understanding of biology while having a blast,” said Marshall-Walker in an email to The Phillipian. Taylor-Brill said that the iGEM team is also looking into the possibility of recruiting students from nearby high schools in Lawrence, Mass., to join the team. “I would really like to get two students from Lawrence on the team because I think they will bring a unique perspective to the team,” said Taylor-Brill. Taylor-Brill said that the team is also seeking members skilled in computer programming, web design or filmmaking. Each team participating in iGEM is required to make a website for their project and an optional video, according to Taylor-Brill. “Synthetic biology is an exciting field that will play a prominent role in our lives, from the creation of new energy sources to the building of new industrial materials and novel immunotherapies.

We were looking at ways to enhance ‘connection’ at school — student-to-student and student-to-faculty [interactions] as well as amongst the faculty — to promote collaboration,” said Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning, at a special luncheon hosted to seek student input on the implementation of the Strategic Plan on Wednesday. The 2014 Strategic Plan has the overarching goal of maximizing the resources at and realizing the potential of Andover. “What has happened with previous strategic shifts with Andover is that first, we’ve taken two fantastic schools, Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy Andover, and merged them. We then committed to need-blind admission, so we’ve created diversity of every kind on campus. What we really need to focus on now is how [to] connect our strengths. How [could] we take the different ideas and experiences that people bring to this community and use those to create a better form of excellence?” said Corinne Field ’83, member of the Strategic Planning Task Force. The faculty will brainstorm possible ways of implementation of the Strategic Plan during the faculty meeting today, according to Skiffer. “The purpose of [the Strategic Plan] is to set a series of questions regarding school priorities. So now [that] we’ve defined the priorities — the areas that the school needs to address — we need to put resources to answering those questions,” said Field. Skiffer said, “The implementation will take place over that three to five year span. So it’s not going to be that, on Monday, you will all be attending a whole new school all of a sudden. This way we will also be able to get more feedback from the students throughout the process.” Two of the most immediate and visible changes brought upon by the Strategic Plan are a new daily class schedule and yearly calendar, according to Catherine Carter, Strategic Planning Task Force Co-Chair and Instructor in Classics. A copy of the finalized plan was sent to the Andover community, and the website is currently being updated accordingly. For each of the three themes highlighted in the Strategic Plan, several more specific initiatives were proposed to further guide the advancement and incorporation of these strategic priorities into the Andover community.? The specific initiatives, taken from the 2014 Strategic Plan website, are listed below. ?? Equity & Inclusion – Create and strengthen support structures so that all students may access the highest levels of our curriculum. – Integrate our advising, house counseling and college counseling programs. – Embed intellectual inquiry related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, faith and sexual orientation in our curriculum and other programming. – Hire and retain diverse, highly qualified faculty, administrators and staff committed to upholding our core values. Christopher Jones, member of the Strategic Planning Task Force and Instructor in History and Social Science, said, “Communities like ours can be limited because of the residues of inequality that existed back in history of the school when women and people of certain color and class were not allowed. So we should make certain that we are looking at these elements that can present inequalities to certain population of students here.”??Creativity & Innovation – Launch the Andover Institute, a collaborative space to assess and share teaching methods and learning tools. – Devote professional development to the exchange of effective pedagogical practices. – Develop more experiential, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary courses. – Support teachers in integrating appropriate technologies as part of their classroom practice. Robert Campbell ’66, Strategic Planning Task Force Co-Chair, said, “With the Andover Institute, I expect it will trickle into a large petri dish of innovation for not only teaching practices, but for learning practices as well. I think it’s going to be a period of very great excitement and change within the Andover community building on what we already think is a great school.” Empathy & Balance – Further incorporate social-emotional learning into our educational program. – Open the Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center for health care and education. – Create a comprehensive, multi-year health curriculum. – Update the scope and philosophy of our athletic program. – Provide an opportunity for every student to study off campus and experience a different culture. Fields said, “I think there’s general agreement that Andover students and faculty try to do too much, and that we’d like to focus more on depth than on quantity. That this is going to be questions of tough trade-off, that we’re going to have to encourage those students and faculty to set priorities, to define what each individual thinks is most important to him or her.”\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\nClad in his brown seersucker jacket, Nile Blunt, Instructor in History, studies Winslow Homer’s “Eight Bells” at the Addison Gallery of American Art. Blunt often strolls through the gallery after the school day ends, gazing at historic works through his thick-rimmed glasses.\n Entering his fourth year of teaching at Andover, Blunt has been very involved in art and history on campus. He has served on a search committee to recruit a new Director of the Addison and has worked as the coordinator for Andover’s collection of art and antiques. In addition to his role as an Instructor in History, he has also coached intramural soccer and Senior tennis and is a house counselor in Taylor Hall. \n He is currently writing a book, entitled “Ceremony, Ritual and King Craft at the Court of King Charles I,” which will explore the dining rituals of nobility in 1600s England through the eyes of politics, religion and culture. \n Largely spurred by his family’s interest in history, Blunt’s own interest in the subject began with frequent visits to museums while growing up in southern New Jersey. \n “Every weekend we would go to museums. We lived about 50 minutes from Philadelphia, so we went to a lot of museums there. We would drive down to D.C. or up to New York doing that kind of thing. Every time we took a vacation, we were going to cities to see the culture and the museums that these cities had,” said Blunt. \n “It is really the stories that draw me to history. When it is done well, history can make stories come alive… As a cultural historian, looking at cultural evidence, being able to piece together these things from the sources that are available and reconstruct stories is exciting because it feels like detective work,” he continued.\n A trip to London helped Blunt narrow his interest in history to a focus on early English history during the 17th century. \n “My real honing in on English history in the 17th century came out of working at the Somerset House museum in London. Having that experience as a historical researcher is really what got me interested in pursuing history and in going to grad school to become a professional historian,” said Blunt.\n Attending American University in Washington, D.C., Blunt originally studied international relations before switching to history during his sophomore year. \n “I switched to history because that was my actual, real interest. [American University] was an amazing place to do a history major,” said Blunt. \n Blunt eventually earned his Ph. D. in Early Modern English History at the University of Illinois, just before his first year as an instructor at Andover. \n Blunt feels that the words “intellectually curious” and “perseverant” would aptly describe his personality. \n “My interests generally, not just in history but in all other things, are very, very broad. I’m a voracious reader, and my bookshelves are filled [with books:] from books about Alexander the Great, to books about Teddy Roosevelt, to books about Walt Whitman. I really value having time to pursue intellectual pursuits in great length,” said Blunt.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\n“Hook Up with Us before You Hook Up with Them,” the first session of the optional sexual education classes given by the Isham Health Center, was held with an audience of just three students in the Freeman Room of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) this Tuesday. “These optional sessions grew out of a desire to provide [Andover] students with access to non-judgmental, credible, interesting information about their body and about intimacy. We think it’s important that students are knowledgeable about healthy relationships, intimacy and sexual health care access,” said Andrea Orben, Health Educator. Although only three students showed up for the pilot session, this is not a reflection of student interest in a sexual education program, but rather an indication that students are not fully aware of the program yet, according to Orben. “If more students start getting exposed to the program and experience it, then I think word of mouth will spread that people actually learned something from the sessions and that it is a good atmosphere to learn and discuss sexual health,” said Orben. The reason so few students showed up may have been due to a stigma attached to attending a talk regarding sexual health, which she hopes will dissipate as more students attend the sessions, according to Orben. According to Sarah Robinson, Nurse Practitioner, the sessions were planned in response to feedback from students, house counselors and the Sexual Education Working Group\xad — a group of faculty members who are working to provide more sex education opportunities for students. “Students told us that they wanted more opportunities with trained adults to learn about sexual health issues. We are excited that the Strategic Plan mentioned improving educational efforts in health and wellness issues, including sexual education topics,” said Robinson. “However, until that becomes formalized, we wanted to offer optional sessions to the student body to learn more about developing healthy relationships, understanding consent and protecting themselves and partners against potential risks,” she continued. The program will address important issues of sexual health in the coming weeks, including birth control and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). According to Orben, one in every two sexually active youths in the United States contracts an STD by the time they reach age 25. “We may think that because of our demographic here at [Andover], those numbers don’t apply to us. But the truth is that, although we might fare a little better than national statistics, we would be remiss to think that our students are immune to STDs or pregnancies.” Currently, Andover’s sexual education program involves a mandatory 75-minute session incorporated into the Physical Education curriculum. There has been acknowledgement among both faculty and students that Andover needs to provide more comprehensive sexual education on campus, according to Orben. “We wanted to provide more comprehensive sessions until [sexual education] was officially incorporated into a program, but the assumption is that sex ed will be required for all students to some degree,” Orben continued. The sessions were designed by Orben, in consultation with Amy Patel, Medical Director, and Robinson.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\n“We are all familiar with our school’s motto, Non Sibi, [meaning] ‘not for self.’ This phrase is not an empty one, but one that carries tremendous value for me and [for] how it manifests itself in the real world. And so, I have a challenge to propose: Be an active and an aware member of the community,” said Alba Disla ’15 during All-School Meeting (ASM) on Wednesday.\n Disla worked alongside administrators of Envision, a London-based, nonprofit organization that helps youth organize community projects to share teenagers’ perspective on community service, as part of her Lorant Fellowship this past summer.\n The Lorant Fellowship is awarded to three Uppers each year who display “earnest endeavor.” One student is granted a fund of up to $6,000 to travel to Europe, Africa or the Middle East during the summer to experience various aspects of unique cultures. The other two nominees were Bryan McGuiggin ’15 and Eun Jae Kim ’15. \n “It took me to go across the Atlantic to see that students our age are doing the same things as we are — using our knowledge to better the world. The challenge of serving the community lies in remembering Andover every step of the way and using what we know and what we’ve been given to enhance the experience of others,” she said.\n While in London, Disla worked in the Envision offices, typically spending her time at a desk inputting data into a computer. Disla recalled visiting a local community service fair on one of the rare occasions when she was not working in the offices.\n “I got to really apply what I was inputting into the computer to the real world, and I was basically selling Envision to other people. The people who went to this community service fair were looking for ways to get involved with their community,” said Disla in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Both Disla’s work with Envision and the visit to the community service fair led her to discover parallels between Envision and Andover.\n “In many ways, the mindset of student members of Envision reflects the mindset of those at Andover. The emergence of [Feminism is Equality] two years ago, the More Than Just a Number campaign and the Phillipian articles show that our community has been more than vocal about topics we are passionate about,” said Disla.\n “I guess just realizing how important it is that people like us recognize the fact that we have voices and our opinions matter, and we have a lot of power even though we don’t think we do. I think that, at places like Andover, we have all of these resources at our fingertips like the financial resources, the human resources, the adults we can rely on and information we have as an institution,” she said in an interview for The Phillipian. \n Along with her job of entering data, Disla had the opportunity to sit in on meetings to help plan outreach programs for local communities.\n “I worked alongside the CEO, the head financing as well as individual project coordinators. Before the summer, I viewed the community service program at Andover from a very naive perspective. I didn’t know there were some people higher up in authority that owned these organizations. The ones actually doing the work, they were the faces of nonprofits,” said Disla.\n After seeing the teenagers go out into their communities with the little resources they had and make a difference, Disla began to see the amount of power each individual had when it came to affecting change.\n “The fact that [Andover] has a platform like The Phillipian and the power to create clubs and organizations about issues important to the students is a huge privilege,” said Disla.\n “If you have something you are passionate about, host a workshop or a forum to teach people about it and them why you’re passionate about it. Tell them why it’s important for others to learn about the issue,” continued Disla.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\nSeven female Andover students sat in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology classroom among 269 other girls from across the country last Saturday, silently awaiting the 20-question math test that would stretch their minds for the next two-and-a-half hours. \n Amy Chou ’16, Diana Ding ’16, Annie Zhu ’17, Jenny Huang ’16, Valerie Zhang ’17, Christine You ’16 and Elizabeth Tso ’18 all participated in the Math Prize for Girls, an invitation-only competition for girls from the U.S. and Canada in the eleventh grade or younger. They were selected based on their American Math Competition (AMC) 10 and AMC 12 scores. \n Zhu and Zhang were the two highest-placing Andover students, placing fifth and receiving an honorable mention, respectively. \n The students spent the day solving math problems, while networking with other high-school girls from around the country. \n The goal of the competition since its inception in 2008 has been to address and take steps to resolve the well-documented issues of gender imbalance in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, according to the Math Prize for Girls’ website. \n “It is true that, most times, when I go to math, after-school classes, that it is almost a boy’s class.… The first impression that you have, might [make you] feel discouraged. But, for the most part, it is fine — you just have to have your own faith and believe that you can also be good at it,” said Tso.\n Statistically, there have been more boys at Andover in higher-level math courses as well as math club and math competitions. There has recently been an increasing trend of girls joining, however, said Khiem DoBa, Instructor in Mathematics and the faculty organizer of the trip.\n As a way to encourage more girls to join math teams at school, as well as push them to enroll in advanced math courses, the faculty try to reflect a gender balance in their own ranks by including both male and female faculty members as coaches for the teams, according to DoBa. \n “Everyone is a unique individual who contributes to the success of the team. As a mentor, I embrace and treasure each individual, whether a girl or boy, a [Junior or Senior], someone newly curious or someone who has had a lot of experience,” he continued.\n Even so, DoBa does recognize the inequality and hopes to see further change in the future. \n “We all know that math is not just for boys. Math is for everyone. It is for any individual who enjoys logical thinking and pursuing their curiosity and creativity,” said DoBa.\n Three of the seven girls who attended the competition — Zhu, Zhang and Chou —have qualified for the Math Prize Olympiad, a test which will be offered at Andover in November. Each student who qualified for the Olympiad will take the test at their school.\n “This year’s problems were actually very inspiring and very [forward] thinking. I like math, and taking part in a competition is a way to prove yourself and also stretch your abilities,” Zhu said. \n “I mainly enjoyed having the opportunity to do really cool math problems. I also liked being able to meet a bunch of awesome people,” said Zhang in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\nBorn and raised in Charlottesville, V.A., Thea Rossman ’15 grew up near the region of the Eastern United States called Appalachia, the focus of her CAMD Scholar presentation.\n Rossman presented her project, “Whiteness, White Supremacy and the Evolution of Appalachia,” this past Tuesday in Kemper Auditorium, discussing the ways in which subtle forms of racism and classism appeared in and are institutionally ingrained in Appalachian society. \n Whites living in the Appalachia region during the 1900s were once considered to be dumb and uncultured, as society characterized them by a primitive, failed whiteness. Even so, Rossman said, they were still considered superior to other races. \n “This is white supremacy. This is the ideology of the superiority of the white race, surviving and changing to fit new circumstances, to abort seeming contradictions,” she said during her presentation. “I used Appalachia as one case study of… [how] race is not made up in stable categories: It’s shifting, it’s defined by power, it changes over time,” she continued. \n In her presentation, Rossman hoped to demonstrate the ways in which apparent reality can be misleading and the ways in which history and narratives are shaped by power.\n “We can think of the stories we use to make sense of the world with race being one of those stories. The ones in power are shaping the dominant narrative and creating the stories that we use to make sense of the world, and then those stories then shape the distribution of resources and power further,” said Rossman in an interview with The Phillipian. \n When aid organizations came to assist the Appalachian people in the 1960s, they focused mainly on the assistance of whites and ignored other racial groups, said Rossman. \n Activists and missionaries devoted to reforming Appalachia were oblivious, however, to the negative effects of their actions. They had good intentions, Rossman said, but they remained ignorant because the effects of the racism they were perpetrating were very subtle.\n “American investment in white supremacy, as shown in Appalachia, shaped the distribution of resources in the Post-Reconstruction Era…. Once removed from the isolation that had arrested their racial development, [Appalachian whites] would move ahead with the rest of the nation because they were white,” she said during the presentation. \n During her research this previous summer, Rossman used the collections of the University of Virginia Library and the internet to find writings on Appalachian studies, primary sources including color pieces, old romance novels and magazines from the time. \n “The interest in the project came from my interest in race and whiteness. I want the main takeaway from my project to be about how whiteness operates in America, not about Appalachia, mainly because so few people here have any connection to Appalachia. ”\n Christopher Jones, Instructor in History and Social Science, was Rossman’s faculty advisor during the project. \n “I thought the presentation was superb — a feeling I believe the audience shared. It is tremendously difficult to take a complex set of subjects, like white supremacy, identity, and Appalachia, and present an argument with such clarity and depth as Thea did. What I read in her paper and heard at her talk was scholarship of a very high order,” said Jones in an email to The Phillipian. \n Rossman’s presentation was the first of the series of CAMD scholar presentation of the year.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\nFreelance journalist and former investment strategist Pamela Ryckman visited campus to speak to female students about the power of forming connections to establish equal rights for women in the workplace.\n The Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP) hosted Ryckman, author of “Stiletto Network,” last Friday night in Kemper Auditorium.\n Drawing upon personal experience and interviews from her book, Ryckman discussed the importance of female networking through so-called “stiletto networks.” \n “Stiletto networks are underground networks … Most of these have no more than ten women but in [total], they [add up to] tens, if not hundreds, of thousands, of women nationwide all at this moment in history all [networking],” said Ryckman.\n According to Ryckman, female networking and collaboration has impacted the growth of businesses established by women. Ryckman cited Gilt Group and LearnVest as examples of successful businesses launched by female partnerships. \n “Because Alexa [Von Tobel, founder and CEO of LearnVest] had all of these powerful women behind her saying, ‘You go girl, you can do it and we believe in you,’ [Von Tobel] is poised to succeed,” said Ryckman.\n “[Within networks there] was this incredible virtuous circle where people were helping each other and leading by giving. They were trying to be helpful and loving in their interactions and finding in this blissful karmic way that it was coming back to them and launching them faster and further than they ever expected,” said Ryckman.\n Ryckman believes that fostering these networks is one of the strongest ways to promote females in positions of leadership.\n “The next decade is going to see an explosion of female wealth and power. Why I am so convinced this is true is because of stiletto networks,” continued Ryckman.\n Mihika Sridhar ’16 attended the presentation and drew parallels between stiletto networks and social movements on campus.\n “I think GLP is very similar to a stiletto network. Meeting other girls and learning about their lives can be in itself a really simple but effective way of networking,” wrote Sridhar in an email to The Phillipian. \n Another attendee of the presentation, Karissa Kang ’17, disagreed with Ryckman’s portrayal of femininity.\n “I didn’t like that the presentation suggested that women who wear suits rather than stilettos are somehow less progressive. I also was disappointed by the general lack of presentation of more masculine women,” wrote Kang in an email to The Phillipian.\n According to Ryckman, connections made through stiletto networks helped her to launch her career as an author. \n “I’m part of the movement because I lived this story as I was writing it… It’s actually a testament to the power of [the importance of female networking] because, as a journalist, I suddenly realized that my career was exploding… So I tell everyone this book is actually built on networks,” said Ryckman.\n Ryckman’s work has been featured in many publications including “The New York Times,” “The Financial Times” and “The New York Observer.” She lives in New York City.\n\n', 'Oct 2, 2014'), ('\nOn September 22, the faculty voted and approved a policy change requiring Seniors to indicate on their college applications their intention to take four courses in the Spring Term. Previously, Seniors had to meet two criteria to approve a four-course load: A student would need approval from both their advisor and their college counselor to take four courses and at least three of the four courses must be deemed “advanced.” With the new policy, Seniors are now obligated to clearly inform colleges that they plan on taking only four classes during the Spring Term, in addition to fulfilling the old criteria. According to Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling, the new rule was added in response to a trend of students taking a less demanding course load after being admitted to college. “We were starting to get some pushback from schools [who were] saying, ‘A lot of your kids are saying they’re going to do this and then they’re changing,’” he said. An advanced course is typically a 500- or 600-level course, although some 400- and 900-level courses are also designated as advanced.

IMPACT, a local non-profit organization that teaches self-defense to youth in Massachusetts, was educating the students in the best ways to fight back against danger.\xa0\nIn the two-hour session, IMPACT taught Andover students the basics of self-defense, instructing them on the effectiveness of vocal aggression as a deterrent, along with various physical maneuvers designed to incapacitate an assailant.\xa0\nAlthough the event was open to all students, only females were in attendance. “People don’t really consider that males can be in danger as well or that males can serve to benefit from something like [the IMPACT program.] I think there’s an expectation that men aren’t going to need to go to these kinds of things,” said Abigail Czito ’15, an organizer of the event. “We wanted to dispel that kind of notion, and we wanted to [say that] anybody can come because we are all potential victims for things like this,” she continued.\xa0\nPaulina Munn ’15, a participant in the program, noted that, despite social stigmas about assault, basic self-defense is important for everyone. She said, “I think it’s such useful information regardless of your gender, sex or height. It’s good to know. I really wish it were part of the curriculum.”\nMeg Stone, Director and Instructor at IMPACT, said, “Whenever I teach a class, I want students to realize that they are powerful and capable in ways that they did not realize. I want them to leave with knowledge about the actual realities about violence, rather than the stereotypes that many of us live with or many of us are surrounded by. And with the knowledge of violence as it actually is, I want them to feel empowered to do something about it.”\xa0\nThe class included several simulations of potential assault situations during which students faced a heavily padded IMPACT instructor acting as an assailant. The students were asked to attempt to escape the situation using tactics they learned from the session.\nMunn said, “It was very nerve-racking, not because I was in the spotlight, but because it got very real. My heart was racing, and I actually had dreams about being attacked and then poking that person’s eyes out.\xa0 But then when I did it, I said to myself, ‘I can do this.’ If I’m being attacked and I’m alone, I will have the skills [acquired through the training] with me.”\nThe organization was brought to campus by an Abbot Academy Association grant written by Czito and Philippine Kugener ’15. They hoped that the class would not only educate students on basic self-defense and personal safety, but that it would also lead to a larger, more extensive self-defense program at Andover.\xa0 “We thought that this is very important for kind of a college campus-esque environment. And because we have such a vast age range and an opportunity to teach people for several years, we should put at least part of that into the Wellness Week curriculum,” said Czito.\xa0\nKugener added, “During Wellness Week you can take Salsa classes.

Starting at 10 p.m, the telescope took photographs for five hours, focusing around the center region of the star system.\nThe 3.5 kilogram new camera has a much bigger chip than one would normally find in a Canon or a Nikon camera, enabling students to take a bigger image of the sky and increase efficiency in their research. It has also doubled sensitivity compared to the old camera by allowing for images of much fainter objects and greatly increasing the range of shooting. “The camera has far exceeded my expectations in terms of sensitivity. Even tonight, we’re seeing images far superior than anything we have ever seen with the previous camera,” said Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics, in regards to the photos taken last Wednesday.\nAlthough the camera will typically be in use from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. every night, the camera can only be used when it is clear outside, according to Odden. The new Andor Ikon DW 436 camera was purchased to upgrade the previous, outdated camera and Odden hopes that some of the features of the new camera will widen the range of possible projects in the Astronomy Research course and the Astronomy club. “I think we’ll be able to take images through color filters. This allows for the possibility of determining the chemical composition for various astronomical objects,” wrote Odden in an email to _The Phillipian_.\nThe use of the new camera will not be limited to students currently taking Astronomy Research class. “The camera will be used also by interested students not in the course.\xa0 It is not the kind of thing that one can use alone without training, but students will be able to take part in the process,” wrote Odden.\nThe camera was purchased with the help of a donation by a family of a student in the Class of 2014, as well an Abbot grant applied for by Odden, Brook Bond ’14 and Laurent Joli-Coeur ’15, President of Astronomy Club.\xa0\n**Haley Suh contributed reporting.**\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nMartha Donovan\n\xa0\n\n\nE.

I am from Sudan, spent 18 years of my life in the Middle East and did some advanced secondary studies in Malaysia before coming to the United States for college.\n* * *\nCatherine Kemp\n\xa0\n\n\nS.RAO/THE PHILLIPIAN\n_Instructor in Biology_\n\xa0\n**What made you want to study and teach biology?**\nTruth: When I went to college, I said, “I don’t know what I want to do but definitely not math or science.” But my freshman summer, I worked in an airplane tire factory as a receptionist, and I swore that I’d find a career that involved neither sitting at a desk nor wearing pantyhose. The course descriptions for ecology were all about chasing frogs around in ponds… and it just went from there.\n**What is your favorite thing to teach in biology?**\nI’m easily excitable about anything, really.

I also have a book called “Alvin Ho: Allergic to Girls, School, and Other Scary Things” by Lenore Look that my nephew gave me to read. We’re in a third-grade book club together.\xa0\n**What are your other campus roles?**\nI’m a [Complementary House Counselor] in Draper Cottage; I’m the faculty advisor for [Southeast Asian] Club; I’ll be coaching Intramural Ultimate Frisbee in the spring and I’m the [Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD)] Program Faculty Fellow, so definitely stop by my office in CAMD and say “hi” if you’re ever around!\n* * *\nKarin Knudson\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nCOURTESY OF KARIN KNUDSON\n_Instructor in Mathematics_\n\xa0\n**What drew you to teaching at Andover?**\nI love teaching math, and I can’t imagine a more exciting place to do that than at Andover. I am inspired by the energy, passion and creativity of the students and my fellow faculty members.\xa0\n**When did you become interested in math, and why do you like it?**\nI love how elegant math problems can be and the satisfaction of working through a challenging one. More recently, I’ve learned to appreciate how useful math can be in different areas. Right now, I’m working on a project in computational neuroscience, and it is so exciting to be using math to understand parts of how the brain works!\n**What is your favorite area in math to teach?\xa0**\nCalculus is probably my favorite area of math to teach because students get to dig so deeply into understanding functions in new ways.\xa0\n* * *\nBrendan Mackinson\n\xa0\n\n\nJ.SCHMITT/THE PHILLIPIAN\n_Instructor in Chemistry_\n\xa0\n**When did you become interested in chemistry, and why do you like it?**\nI became interested in chemistry in my tenth-grade chemistry class — I had a great teacher! Chemistry provides scientists with powerful tools to explore complex, multidisciplinary problems, and, in that way, it can be a key that unlocks doors into lots of interesting places.\n**What is your favorite topic in chemistry to teach? Why?**\nLe Chatelier’s Principle. Le Chatelier’s Principle helps us understand how many natural systems respond to change and why these responses are sometimes beautiful, sometimes scary and oftentimes counterintuitive.\n* * *\nMarisela Ramos\n\xa0\n\n\nJ.BECKWITH/THE PHILLIPIAN\n_Instructor in History and Social Science_\n\xa0\n**What drew you to teach at Andover?**\nHaving attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, I was familiar with Andover’s reputation as a place that attracts smart and curious students. When I learned that there was an opening in the History Department, I knew I had to apply! My goal in teaching has always been to influence how people think rather than what they think.\n**When did you become interested in history?**\nWhen I was in high school, I tried to get out of taking U.S. History. History had never appealed to me. There was very little that I could connect with because of the rigid way it is usually taught. Things changed for me in college when I was able to take a variety of classes on topics like women’s history and blacks in Latin America.\n* * *\nJeremy Rosenholtz\n\xa0\n\n\nL.LUO/THE PHILLIPIAN\n_Instructor in English_\n\xa0\n**What drew you to teaching at Andover?**\nI was drawn to the diversity of the student body, the school’s reputation for excellence, the beautiful campus and the fact that the food in the [Paresky] Commons is better than what I can actually cook by myself.\xa0\n**What is your favorite word? Why?**\nBecause I’m a “Simpsons” fan, my favorite word is “Doh!”\n**What courses will you be teaching? And what else will you be doing on campus this year?**\nI am teaching two sections of English 200 and a Senior elective — Comedy and Satire. Because I am an adjunct instructor, I won’t be leading any major activities on campus, but I am interested in meeting any students who want to challenge me to a game of chess. I am also willing to teach anyone interested in learning how to juggle.\n\xa0\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nThe Dole Room in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) became a silent study space this Wednesday in order to address student complaints about limited seating in the Garver Room.\n “We have always been committed to being able to provide the kind of study space that a student wants at any given time. So if you come into [the OWHL] looking to work in a silent space, then we want to be able to allow you to do so,” said Elisabeth Tully, Director of the OWHL. \n “Also, this summer, we’ve increased a lot of collaborative space by removing stacks on the second floor and buying new furniture for both there and [the basement], so we felt that taking the Dole [Room] offline for collaborative study would not be a real problem for kids,” she continued.\n The Dole Room’s adjacency to the Garver Room made it an ideal space to serve as an extended silent study area. “It is important so that one proctor could be [present] in both [rooms] to make sure that people are not talking,” Tully said. \n There are signs posted on the doors entering the Dole Room that indicate the new silence policy. The librarians currently do not intend to make a formal announcement about the change.\n “It’s an experiment. We are continuously fine-tuning what we do to meet student needs. We have a quick little survey in the works that we hope a lot of the student body will respond to, letting [the librarians] know what kind of study spaces they want… So if this new arrangement doesn’t seem to be working, then we can simply just change it back or try something else,” she said. \n To further increase seating capacity in silent study areas, additional tables may be placed in the newly vacant area in the Garver Room that formerly held the Help Desk.\n “We moved the Help Desk because we needed it up on the second floor. Because we added so much seating capacity [upstairs] and [because] it is a collaborative working space, we thought that it would be good to have supervision up there as well as help for students studying,” said Tully. \n “We haven’t really made hard and fast decisions on what to do with that space in [the Garver Room] because we would really like to hear from students,” she continued.\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nAfter reconsideration, Andover will sign a two-year extension of its electricity contract with Integrys Energy, Inc., when the current contract expires. World Energy Solutions, Inc., an energy management firm, brokered the deal using an online bidding system.\n “There were multiple bidders for multiple durations of supplying electricity, and through the online bidding process, Integrys won the bid to provide electricity for the next two years,” said Larry Muench, Director of Facilities in the Office of the Physical Plant (OPP).\n World Energy arranged the contract between Andover’s OPP representatives and the Integrys energy team after Integrys won the auction to supply Andover with electricity.\n “Their office established the auction timing, and we sat with the World Energy representative in a conference room in Draper Hall watching and participating in real time,” said Muench. \n According to Muench, Andover uses an average of 14.2 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year. Electrical companies supply 13.5 million kWh, and the turbine generator on campus produces the other 0.7 million kWh. \n The cost of electricity in the current contract is $0.085 per kWh, while the new contract will cost the school $0.0904 per kWh. \n Although the price of electricity increased between the two contracts, Andover secured a price $0.0106 below market value.\n “I feel we extracted the best price from the competitive open market, and I’m happy the winning firm is one known to [Andover],” said Muench.\n Gil Major, Senior Manager of Operations, and Annette Bridgewater, OPP Materials Manager, researched World Energy and proposed the company for the electricity contract negotiations.\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nSurrounded by video cameras in a cramped Boston College classroom, Kathleen Dalton, Instructor in History, responded calmly to a string of questions, all centered on the Roosevelt family.\n Dalton was one of 15 historians featured in Ken Burns’s seven-part, 14-hour long documentary, “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History,” last week.\n The documentary details the lives of the Roosevelt family, starting with Theodore Roosevelt’s birth in 1858 and ending with Eleanor Roosevelt’s death in 1962. Dalton discussed Theodore Roosevelt’s life after 1912.\n A renowned Roosevelt historian, Dalton is known especially for her biography, “Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life,” which she credits for introducing her to Burns’s scriptwriter, Geoffrey Ward, and eventually landing her the documentary feature. \n Dalton has been featured in several documentaries throughout her career, such as C-Span’s “First Ladies: Influence and Image.” She has found these opportunities to be creative escapes from traditional teaching methods. \n “As a history teacher and a professional historian, I see documentary filmmaking as an art form. There are aesthetic and storytelling choices that any documentary filmmaker makes. I see it as a creative process and also how the average person who’s not taking a history course gets their history,” said Dalton. \n “Whenever a documentary about the Roosevelts comes up, I am happy to share what I know. Doing public history means sharing your scholarship with new audiences, and an entertaining documentary film is a good way to do that,” wrote Dalton in an email to The Phillipian. \n From Dalton’s perspective, Burns’s style focused more on appealing to a large audience, using a slightly different portrayal of Roosevelt than that in Dalton’s book.\n Despite her disagreements with some of the ways the Roosevelts were depicted in the documentary, Dalton admires Burns’s prowess and has high hopes for the success of the film. \n “He also has an aesthetic that’s really quite compelling because he looks at photographs in great detail…. [In particular,] he looks for facial expressions. I have used [Burns’s work] in my class to teach history because he’s a really good story teller,” said Dalton.\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nOn September 17, Ai-Jen Poo ’92 became one of 21 MacArthur Foundation Fellows of 2014 for her dedication to the field of labor organization. The MacArthur Foundation annually awards unrestricted fellowships to individuals who show originality and dedication toward their passions and goals, according to the organization’s website. Poo’s work in labor organization focuses on the transformation of working conditions and labor rights for domestic workers — housekeepers, nannies and caregivers for the disabled or the elderly — who are often excluded from many labor laws. In 2010, Poo emerged triumphant from a hard-fought, seven-year long legislative campaign for the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights in New York, a document that entitles workers to overtime pay, a day of rest every week, protection from discrimination and three days of paid leave every year. “I believe I was chosen because of the dynamism and courage of the domestic workers I work with and what we have collectively achieved as a movement, which speaks to so many who want change and a better life but might not have imagined this type of progress was possible,” wrote Poo in an email to The Phillipian. As part of the MacArthur Fellow Program, Poo was awarded a $625,000 grant to invest toward her goals in labor rights. “I plan to create a fellowship program at my organization, to allow for caregivers and domestic workers to work with me and spend focused time shaping the future of care-related public policy,” said Poo. Poo primarily works with women in the workforce, especially women of color and immigrant women, to improve their job opportunities and wages. “Women are at least half of today’s paid workforce and more than half of all college graduates and of the electorate. Women’s experiences are increasingly defining of the whole of our society today. Improving life and opportunity for women is fundamental to improving life for all of us,” said Poo. Poo’s passion for labor rights for women began when she volunteered at a domestic violence shelter and saw the importance of economic security and opportunity to living safe lives. “I thought if we could improve work and wages for women working in the most invisible parts of our economy, it could address so many other problems,” she continued. After working as lead organizer of Domestic Workers United, in 2007, Poo co-founded the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), an organization that unites domestic workers nationwide to improve work conditions. Poo’s short-term goals for the NDWA include passing bills to protect the rights of domestic workers and establishing workforce training programs to prepare laborers to support the growing population of elderly people in America. Poo said, “We are also working to change culture, specifically to change the way the nation feels about aging and [how it] values caregiving, through our [partnership] with organizations in Caring Across Generations, [a campaign that Poo co-directs].” In the long term, Poo hopes to ensure that all domestic workers have dignity for their work. In 2012, Poo was named one of “Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World” and one of “Newsweek’s 150 Women Who Shake the World.”\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nOn Monday evening, Head of School John Palfrey descended the steps to the basement of Samuel Morse Hall. He paused in the doorway to announce the completion of the successful Phillipian Endowment campaign, which raised $654,000 for the independent uncensored paper, surpassing its original $500,000 goal. Since the launch of the Endowment campaign in October 2013, more than 600 alums, parents and friends of The Phillipian contributed to the endowment, according to Gail Mansfield, Director of Major Gifts and Annual Giving. Income from the endowment will provide a free hard copy of The Phillipian to all Andover students, renew technology and equipment, and enable on- and off-campus opportunities for future boards. The initial push for an endowment came after the economic downturn in 2008, when subscriptions barely covered The Phillipian’s operating costs. “The idea for fundraising to secure The Phillipian’s future floated around the newsroom as this unattainable ideal during our board year. Subscriptions were down and it was becoming harder and harder to break even financially,” said Julia Zorthian ’11, Editor in Chief of The Phillipian vol. CXXXIII in an email to The Phillipian. “When I went off to college in 2011, I saw how our newspaper here has an endowment and prints free copies for everyone, so it seemed more possible for Andover.” Zorthian, a member of The Phillipian Advisory Board, discussed the idea of an endowment with the board the following year. “It was amazing how quickly the group convened a Phillipian Endowment Committee to start, and quickly finish, the fundraising. Andover’s OAR also took on a large role with coordinating the campaign while respecting the paper’s independence,” she said. The Phillipian Endowment will be a subsidiary of Andover’s greater endowment. Roughly half of The Phillipian’s annual operating costs will be covered by the endowment, so students will still be expected to manage the paper like a small business, generating advertising revenue and producing issues within an annual budget. “The paper’s independence has always been guaranteed by precedent, by the school respecting that the paper is uncensored and unsupervised, and by the paper’s ability to support itself as a business. This endowment will secure the future of that independence for as far as we can see. A community with a truly free press is an extraordinary place and that’s what Andover is,” said Nina Scott, Advisor to The Phillipian and Instructor in English. The endowment will also fund the digital renovation of The Phillipian, including redesigning the website, creating a mobile application and expanding the video section. “What will be really fun is to see what The Phillipian does with it all,” Palfrey said to the newsroom on Monday. “How you will make the transition from the analogue era institution into what I call ‘digital plus?’” Zorthian said, “I could not be more thrilled to know the paper will remain a part of Andover’s changing campus. It’s great to imagine decades of staffers and editors to come producing the paper together from the newsroom in the Morse basement, all being connected by this amazing experience.” The Phillipian will host a celebration of the completed endowment in April in New York City, however, there was a small gathering of The Phillipian Endowment board and some donors in honor of the conclusion of the campaign. Palfrey, Tom Rubin ’79, Co-Chair of the Endowment Campaign and Chief Intellectual Property Strategy Counsel, and Chris Hughes ’02, Publisher & Executive Chairman of The New Republic, Co-Founder of Facebook spoke at the event, which Hughes hosted. Rubin said, “Whether Phillipian alumni have gone on to greatness in journalism or benefitted from the experience by becoming independent thinkers and leaders in other fields, we share common ground: namely, the abiding faith that was put in us before we earned it. And that faith significantly contributed to the people we have become. We are grateful to Andover, and we have committed through this campaign to ensure that future generations can similarly benefit.”\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nFive Seniors and one alumnus submitted a [petition](http://www.scribd.com/doc/241370696/Room-Visiting-Policy-Petition?secret_password=cSBQcOpNEZ31BJmm8YPI) to the faculty and administration this week in opposition to new room visiting policies. Signed by 802 students, alumni and parents, the petition protests the policy changes approved by a faculty vote last spring.\nThe controversial changes included a requirement for upperclassmen to leave their doors ajar and lights on during room visits. The measure passed with 61 percent of faculty in favor and 26 percent in opposition, while 13 percent abstained.\nThe petition argues that the new policies will force students to seek other, less safe places to have sex, deter students from seeking faculty guidance and increase illegal parietals, among other issues.\nGrace Tully ’15, Lily Grossbard ’15, Emma Kukielski ’15, Jaleel Williams ’15, Corinne Singer ’15 and Dan Wang ’14 co-authored the petition to ask the faculty to reconsider the decision. The petition was written on behalf of Feminism is Equality (F=E), a student group focused on raising awareness about sexism on campus, according to its website.\nThe petition gained momentum last spring on campus and across social media platforms as students rallied in reaction to the new rules.\n“The impetus behind the petition came from the hundreds of students who took to social media to express their frustration, members of F=E and students who have expressed interest in the F=E movement,” said Singer.\nThe petition reads, “As students, alumni and parents [of students at Andover], we feel that these new room-visiting rules are not only counterproductive towards achieving the ideals of mutual trust and respect promoted by our community, but also a threat to the collective health of the student body.”\nWilliams said, “The goal of our petition is to show the faculty where the student body is coming from and show how much of the student body is united in opposition to this rule. It’s also to show how serious an issue these new rules are.”\nThe petition argues that, in the case of sexual assault, students may be less likely to confide in a faculty member out of fear of disciplinary repercussions.\nKukielski said, “If there is any instance of sexual assault between students in an illegal parietal or outside, they are going to be so much less likely to report it to a faculty member because they know they weren’t supposed to be doing it in the first place, so that’s one major concern.”\nIn addition, the petition points out that the rules run the risk of disconnecting students and faculty about issues relating to sexual activity. The petition reads, “These new rules, regardless of intent, discourage such candor [between students and faculty] by reinforcing the notion of sexual intimacy as something that makes all Andover faculty members inherently uncomfortable, which … establishes a deeply problematic framework within which the comfort of the faculty takes precedence over our sexual health.”\nThe petition also discusses the lack of room-visiting policies regarding homosexual and queer students.\nWilliams said, “The new changes to [the rules] have made absolutely no progress in including queer students on campus, and the heteronormativity and cisnormativity of the policies only further the “other-ing” isolation that queer students feel on campus.”\nThe co-authors hope that the petition will not only spark discussion, but also generate reflection from faculty about the new parietal rules.\n“While we realistically understand that this petition will not be enough on its own for the faculty members to revoke the rules they have just voted on, we hope that this petition will serve as a springboard for an on-campus dialogue. In establishing a consensus, we hope to solidify and convey some of the issues students, faculty and parents have with the policies,” said Singer.\n_A copy of the petition has been uploaded below:\xa0_\n[Room Visiting Policy Petition](https://www.scribd.com/doc/241370696/Room-Visiting-Policy-Petition?secret_password=cSBQcOpNEZ31BJmm8YPI “View Room Visiting Policy Petition on Scribd”)\n\n\n', 'Sep 25, 2014'), ('\nCrowded into the Fuess House common room during Orientation Weekend, the 35 new Environmental Coordinating Officers (ECOs) discussed issues of sustainability as part of a new campus-wide initiative to bring good environmental practice to dorms and buildings on campus. \n Last spring, several environmentally conscious students applied to become ECOs to work with adults and house counselors in academic and residential buildings to establish and maintain sustainable trash and recycling programs.\n The program plans to use hands-on experiences, such as having students carry their trash and recycling in their backpacks, to draw community members’ attention to their impact on the environment.\n “In the long run, we want to see people develop these habits and not want to live any other way because they know that this is the right way to preserve our environment,” said Mark Cutler, Instructor in Spanish and faculty advisor of the ECO program.\n The ECOs oversee sustainability in all of the dorms and some of the larger academic and administrative buildings. All dorms have a designated ECO, but smaller dorms may not necessarily have an ECO who lives in the dorm.\n “We worked on that a lot during Green Move-In and Opening Weekend, and we made sure that the trash systems were set up. We will also talk to students about recycling things that they didn’t necessarily know that they could, because we realized that a lot of students didn’t know proper recycling techniques,” said Lily Grossbard ’15, Director and Student Coordinator of the program.\n Unlike the prior E-Proctor program, which laid most of the responsibility upon the adults and house counselors of dorms and buildings, the students are the grassroots of the new ECO program, according to Cutler.\n ECOs will work closely with Paul Wolff, the new Office of Physical Plant (OPP) sustainability coordinator, to carry out the logistics of recycling and trash, obtain supplies and contact custodians. They will also meet every other week to discuss important topics related to sustainability, both at Andover and in a global context, which they will present to their designated dorms.\n According to Cutler, the idea of having representatives in dorms to maintain good environmental practices originated in Fuess House in 2010, when house counselors, including Cutler, hatched the idea to assign a proctor for this duty.\n “[The house counselors] tried to spread this idea around campus, and some students became involved at different times and places. Last year, several students and I started talking about effective ways to spread this system throughout all the dorms,” said Cutler.\n The new program was developed by Cutler, Grossbard, Dan Wang ’14, Jessica Gammon ’14, Alex Tamkin ’14 and Debbie Shepard, OPP sustainability manager. \n Looking toward the future of the program, Cutler mentioned discussions between ECOs and other students, aptly named “Trashtalk,” to talk through better environmental practice, focusing especially on younger students.\n “We want to have a real presence in the [Junior] dorms, because if we start to educate and train them now and tell them that this is the way things are done, it will make ECO-ing a lot easier in the future, and in two to three years we will see real, significant results,” said Cutler.\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2014'), ('\nStanding at the starting line in the heart of the White Mountain National Forest, Amy Patel, Medical Director at Isham Health Center, and her husband Jason York, part-time Athletics Coach, had only one goal in mind: to complete the 207-mile race ahead of them.\n This past weekend, Patel and York participated in the “Reach the Beach Relay” in New Hampshire with Martin Abel, husband of Willa Abel, Instructor in Biology, and three other close friends. Each participant on the team, called “Out of Order,” ran around 35 miles. The team finished 79th out of the 541 teams that competed, running the entire race in 27 hours, 43 minutes and three seconds. \n Patel and York first ran in the relay ten years ago when one of Patel’s friends invited them to participate after discovering the race. Since then, the couple has partaken in the race six times. They have been joined in past years by other Andover faculty, including Nancy Lang, Instructor in Mathematics and Assistant Dean of Studies, and Kassie Archambault, Admission Officer. \n “I’ve been running since I was a young child and continue to find that it’s my main source of athletic activity. Also, to be able to participate in the relay has been just a great experience. It is a fun activity, and it allows me to exercise my individual interest in running while enjoying the team camaraderie that comes from doing a relay race,” said Patel.\n York said, “It’s something that we’ve really liked. This is our second time in the last two years that we’ve run it, and it’s just a super fun experience as a team, and I think that’s why we do it. It’s a lot of fun, even though it sounds like a lot of work.” \n “You really get that feeling of teamwork with this race because you don’t want to let your teammates down. And at the end, you say to yourself, ‘Oh wow, I was able to push myself to those limits, and it ended up working out,’” he continued.\n When training for the relay, the two focused on attaining the endurance needed to complete some of the harder legs of the course, often running with their peers on campus in the months leading up to the race.\n The 207-mile run, sponsored by New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., was divided into 36 sections, with each section ranging between three and nine-and-a-half miles. Runners coming from as far as Europe and Asia participated in the race.\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2014'), ('\nAfter receiving input from students, faculty and alumni, the strategic plan made its way from a stack of white papers, surveys and meetings to a formal draft.

Guided by the principle of financial sustainability, we will concentrate our resources over the next three to five years on the advancement of three sets of strategic priorities, each indispensable to and often intersecting with the others.\n “By promoting EQUITY AND INCLUSION, we will move toward full realization of opportunity for young women and young men from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION in and out of the classroom will spark the intellectual curiosity of students with wide- ranging academic talents and life experiences. We will weave lessons of EMPATHY AND BALANCE throughout our program, teaching our students to acknowledge their obligations to others and the natural world, to respect diversity of thought and to value health and reflection.\n “We focus this Strategic Plan on the quality and fullness of the Andover experience. We will ensure that each of our students appreciates the advantages of living and learning among peers with various perspectives. We will forge new understanding beyond the traditional boundaries of the academy. We will recognize that ‘Non Sibi’ calls for civic engagement, self-awareness and prudent use of resources.

I had a blast.\n* * *\nHoward Kalter\n_Teaching Fellow in Math_\n**What is your favorite mathematical equation or formula?**\nMy favorite to teach is the Quadratic Equation because I get to sing a song.\n**Why did you decide to teach math?**\nMy undergraduate degree is in mathematics. I like trying to make math fun for students because sometimes it has a stigma of being a dry subject. My goal is to make it something that students don’t dread.\n**What drew you to Andover?**\nI graduated from Andover in 2007, but feel like I never really left. The Teaching Fellow program seemed a perfect fit for a young teacher who bleeds blue.\n* * *\nLaura Lowry\n_Teaching Fellow in History_\n**What made you decide to become a history teacher?**\nIn the fourth grade, I got really interested in the Ancient Egyptians, and for a project I came to class dressed as a pharaoh complete with a golden staff. I’ve also been fortunate to have had some pretty outstanding teachers who cultivated my passions inside the classroom.\n**What is your favorite time period in history? Why?**\nMy favorite time period would be the French Revolution because I’m French, but more because of its impact on the political development of other nations and the fact that it marks the arrival of nationalism to the scene, which happens to be a passion of mine.\n* * *\nGenevieve Barrons\n_Teaching Fellow in English_\n**What are you looking forward this year?**\nThe New England fall! And seeing snow for the first time in seven years.\n**What is your favorite word?**\n“Phantasmagoria.”\n**What is your favorite book/story? Why?**\nI usually go with “Pride and Prejudice,” which is a bit cliché, but I really do believe it is the most perfect novel written in the English language. There is not a single plot line or sentence out of place in the entire thing. And each time I read it I’m reminded of what a hilariously funny writer [Jane] Austen is. But ask me on another day and I might give you another answer.\n* * *\nJulianne McDonough\n_Teaching Fellow in Chemistry_\n**What drew you to Andover?**\nAndover is a community that fosters intellectual, artistic and athletic development for all its students and faculty.\n**Why chemistry?**\nScience fosters discovery by engaging student’s curiosity and providing tools to understand everyday life. My passion has grown more specifically towards chemistry because chemistry is our world; it is all around us and within us.\n**What is your favorite chemical element? Why?**\nCarbon! Carbon is essential to all living organisms; it is the building block of life. Carbon is found in our food, our clothes and the gasoline that fuels our cars. Carbon also exists in a number of pure forms including graphite and diamonds!\n* * *\nAmanda Washington\n_Teaching Fellow in Spanish_\n**Why Andover?**\nWhen I came to campus for my interview, I was very impressed with the diversity of activities on campus and the mature conversations that students and faculty were engaging in. I knew immediately it was a place where I could learn as much as I taught, and I just had to get involved with the meaningful interactions that occur each day on this campus.\n**What is your favorite Spanish word? What does it mean?**\nMy favorite word is “aguacate,” which means “avocado.” It’s fun to say and just rolls off the tongue. Plus it’s helpful when ordering guacamole in Spanish because it’s a key component of the dish!\n* * *\nAmy Shoemaker\n_Teaching Fellow in Mathematics_\n**Why Andover?**\nI have a wide variety of passions, and working at a boarding school is an incredible way to pursue those disparate interests in the classroom, pool and dorm. In even just my first week, I’ve met so many amazing students, faculty and staff members with whom I’ve connected about math, athletics, philosophy, tea and so much more.\n**Why math?**\nMath urges us to contemplate both the concrete and the abstract in order to discover relationships and create new theories. Math is a place where I can feel simultaneously humbled and powerful amidst its complexities and elegance. To me, math is philosophical; it provides new ways of looking at the world and testing its limits. And with so much of math lying in that liminal space of trans-physical, universal truth, there’s always more to explore.\n* * *\nAnnabelle Hicks\n_Teaching Fellow in French_\n**What made you want to teach French?**\nAfter teaching enrichment classes in France and working at an historical museum, I realized that I love interacting with people.

In addition to singing in the chorus, I plan to participate in the Breadloaf community service program. I will also be coaching indoor and outdoor track and field.\n* * *\nYue Cao\n_Teaching Fellow in Mathematics_\n**What made you want to teach math?**\nI trace my interest in teaching math in a boarding school to my enthusiasm in the subject and the inspiring teachers I had while attending boarding schools. I am also amazed to find that math is not only the universal language of science, but it is also a language of aesthetics that appears in our daily life beyond textbooks.\n**Why Andover?**\nI was drawn to Andover for its supportive Teaching Fellow program. I also enjoyed talking to people in the Math Department and liked their sense of humor on the day of interview.\n**What is your favorite number?**\n20. It happened to be the number of my lockers in both middle school and high school. What a coincidence!\n* * *\nCaitlin Monroe\n_Teaching Fellow in History_\n**What drew to teaching at Andover?**\nThe high academic standards and strong sense of community really appealed to me. I was also excited to have the opportunity to work at another boarding school. Having attended one myself, I appreciate how meaningful the experience can be, and I value the deep relationships that are formed between teachers and students.\n**What is your favorite time period in history to teach?

I think it is fascinating to look at how the institutions and ideas that we take for granted were started and developed.\n* * *\nMarian Homans-Turnbull\n_Teaching Fellow in English_\n**What is your favorite story/book?**\nRight now I’d say Ursula Le Guin’s “The Left Hand of Darkness” and Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” are two of my favorites.\n**What drew you to Andover?**\nThe Teaching Fellow program is a great opportunity for new teachers, and I’d heard glowing reports of the faculty and students here.\n**What’s your favorite thing about teaching English?**\nStudents are already showing me new ways to read familiar texts and new ways to apply the lenses of English class to texts (broadly construed) from other areas of life.\n* * *\nSpencer Diamond\n_Teaching Fellow in Physics_\n**What’s your favorite physics law?**\nI really like Maxwell’s equations because they allow you to solve practical problems while also hinting at the grander themes like symmetry and asymmetry of nature.\n**Who’s your favorite physicist?**\nPaul Dirac, because he made so many contributions to physics by thinking in ways that were beyond the comprehension of even his brilliant contemporaries like Pauli,\xa0Schrodinger and Heisenberg.

The main goal of the Piette program, however, was the participation in several archaeological digs.\nThe foundations of the Piette program were set in 2009 when Claire Gallou, Instructor in French, had her classes translate French documents about Édouard Piette’s archeological collection. The documents were a request from the French National Archaeological Museum to return objects from his collection. Their exchange launched a partnership between Andover and the Archeological Museum that led to this summer’s Piette program, according to the Andover Institute’s website.\n“Even though I had been to France many times prior, seeing that country and its history through the eyes of nine very bright and intellectually curious students allowed me to experience the history and culture of that country in a totally new way,” wrote Nile Blunt, Instructor in History and chaperone on the trip.\nIndiana Sobol ’17,\xa0who participated in the program, said the program gave her a deeper understanding of French archeology and history.\n“We visited a few caves and before long, we only had one left…there was an American woman who kept asking random questions that she thought were very advanced, but everyone from the Piette program…practically mouthed the answers along with the guide.

While on the three-and-a-half-week program, the students stayed in Kunming, a city in southern China.\nThroughout the program, students investigated issues of water scarcity, pollution and damming in both China and the United States through the lenses of economics, philosophy and biology. Students saw firsthand issues of water pollution, usage and treatment in field trips to local lakes, water treatment plants and a rose nursery, the largest exporter of roses in China.\nSimultaneously, the program emphasized cultural exchange by pairing each American student with a Chinese partner, with whom they eventually shared a room. Students and teachers formed close bonds through playing sports, including Ultimate Frisbee, soccer, basketball and tai chi, on a daily basis.\n“The American kids, whether they were fluent in Chinese or had no experience at all, learned a lot more about China, about these kids’ lives and about the language than they knew before. They learned a lot about the world environmental situation and the challenges of freshwater in the US and in China,” said Thomas Hodgson, Instructor and Chair in Philosophy and Religious Studies and Program Director and teacher at BASK in ASK.\nBASK in ASK allowed Alphonse Le ’15 to explore aspects of his heritage he had not understood in the past. “For the first time, I could see my mother’s stories from her childhood in Asia come to life around me… BASK really helped me to view current events and issues in a more multidisciplinary lens than I had before. By taking classes each with a different approach to the same subject, I could recognize the multidimensional aspects of topics such as water quality, especially examining the similar challenges facing both the USA and China,”\n* * *\nBrazil PLACES\n_Andover in Brazil_\nFive Andover students explored sustainable development in a three-week trip to Brazil by studying the country through biology, literature and architecture. The program, Brazil PLACES, promoted the investigation and comparison of problems in Brazil to similar issues around the world.\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the students and faculty examined the methods in which the city expanded from its humble beginnings 500 years ago to the large metropolis it now is.\n“We were asking: what were the factors that prompted this development, the political, economic, social, artistic and cultural, etc., factors? Who benefited [from the expansion]? Who did not benefit?” said Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and organizer of PLACES.\nThe program also visited a sustainable coffee farm near the city of Piracicaba and stayed with environmentally-conscious rubber tree tappers in the Amazon. While touring, students were exposed to the concept that sustainable business could still be profitable. This notion, Vidal said, is applicable to the entirety of the world.\n“My favorite aspect [of PLACES] was the sense of feeling at home. There was this all-around sense that I don’t feel different in this country, even though it’s a foreign place… I feel as if I’m at home,” said Madison Pettaway ’17, a participant on the trip.\n“Even if you aren’t interested in architecture, agriculture or sustainability—those aren’t my favorite topics—you should still go; they are presented in a way that is so interesting and available for everyone,” she continued.\n* * *\nSouth African Arts Trip\n_Andover Artists in South Africa_\nMusic, dance and visual arts melded together in a fusion of South African and American culture during the “South Africa & Arts” trip to the South African cities of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Grahamstown.\nThe Andover community got a preview of their tour during April’s “Rhythms of Hope” dance show.\n“We wanted to combine the arts departments into a multi-disciplinary performance project examining themes of cultural and artistic fusion,” said Peter Cirelli, Instructor and Chair in Music and one of the faculty organizers for the trip.\nThe “South Africa & Arts” trip focused on the exploration of issues of personal identity and social justice. The students who attended the program were encouraged to interact with and better understand the post-apartheid culture of South Africa and the significance of arts during that era.\nJacob Peffer ’17, a jazz musician who attended the trip, said, “The themes in the [Rhythms of Hope] included the tension between the blacks and the whites in the townships of South Africa, the unfair stereotypes that come along with race and the imprisonment of blacks.”\nThe musicians, dancers and artists on the trip visited Nelson Mandela’s House, performed for the Cafca music program, watched a performance from the Kliptown youth program and visited several museums including the Apartheid Museum, the District 6 Museum and the Ibiza art museum.\n“The Kliptown Youth\xa0Program in Soweto, Johannesburg is located in a shantytown with many challenges, including access to clean water, sanitation, education [and] unemployment… Feeling the stark contrast between that environment and Andover, while we simultaneously witnessed the extreme happiness and the warm welcome we received from the Kliptown residents, was overwhelming,” said Cirelli.\nThe students also visited the Oprah Winfrey School for Girls, where they spoke with Becky Sykes, former Associate Head of School at Andover, and had the chance to dance and create music with some of the girls at the school.\n“Everyone was so humble, caring and grateful for what they had no matter what their situation happened to be. Overall the trip was incredible and a big part of this was the amazing people we met along the way,” said Katie Graber ’16, a member of the Andover Dance Group who attended the trip.\n* * *\nNiswarth\n_Andover in Ahmedabad, India_\nThe word “Niswarth” means “Non Sibi” in Hindi. Andover’s Niswarth program looks to create a valuable, effective, “Non Sibi” experience for every participant.\nIn its ten-year existence, Niswarth has taken eight trips to India. During each three-week trip, students have explored the concepts behind service and learned about social entrepreneurship in India.\nWhile at the Chandalodia School and Gandhi Ashram School in Ahbedabad, students designed and implemented projects using a Design for Change (DFC) model, according to Arzu Singh ’16, who participated in Niswarththis summer.\n“[The DFC model] is when you step into a community, and instead of assuming you know everything they need and as an outsider you understand how their community functions, you spend a lot time trying to learn about the community… and see where your efforts can best be placed,” said Singh.\nRajesh Mundra, one of the\xa0faculty organizers of Niswarth, described the importance of the DFC framework in an email to The Phillipian.\n“The process of understanding needs, designing a response, going back to get more information, working as a team with other students and organizations, opened our minds for how to approach any work in any community,” he wrote.\nFor Singh, Niswarth served as a\xa0way of observing the practical uses of “Non Sibi” first hand. “[Andover] always talks about ‘Non Sibi,’ but personally on campus I have never felt that. The community service program is big and it is expansive, but I still feel that it doesn’t necessarily support our huge embodiment of ‘Non Sibi.’ I guess I wanted to see how one could actually be ‘Non Sibi’ and see how people are making changes around the world,” said Singh.\n* * *\nRussian Language Trip\n_Andover in Russia_\nFor the 35th year, Victor Svec, Instructor in Russia, took 12 Andover students to Petrozavodsk, Russia for three weeks to improve their knowledge of Russian language and culture.\n“The hopes and the expectations are always the same: first and foremost, to get people outside of their personal comfort zone. Second is to get people to start realizing that there are other ways of doing things in the world, and third is [to] improve their Russian,” said Svec.\nStudents on the trip had the opportunity to experience Russian culture firsthand by staying with host families, visiting a Russian school and taking a trip to Kizhi Island in the middle of Lake Onega to visit the open-air museum of history and architecture.\nRyan Simard ’16, who went on the Russian Language trip, said, “I definitely felt a culture shock. On the first day, my host’s nephew took me on a trip around the city in his car. The entire ride, I was amazed as to how different the city looked from anything in America.”\nIn addition to taking Russian language class for two hours each day, students interacted with native Russian students who were learning to speak English.\n“[The Russian students’] assignment was to video interview us, and some of the questions were really interesting. I was beyond pleased and shocked at how composed, thoughtful and diplomatic [the American students’] responses were,” said Svec.\nOn the Russian Language trip, Andover students were encouraged to embrace the differences and recognize the similarities between the American and Russian cultures.\n“One specific memory that stuck with me was when a few of the Russian kids we met were talking about American culture. Although they were halfway around the world, they still listened to the same music and watched the same movies,” said Simard.\n\n', 'Sep 13, 2014'), ('\nInstead of heading downtown to the Andover Bookstore to buy their textbooks before the start of school this year, students ordered their books online through Follett, a retail and wholesale distributor of educational materials including textbooks. Andover’s partnership with the Andover Bookstore came to an end last spring as the Academic Council began to search for a different kind of bookselling service that would best fit the needs of students, parents and faculty members. Cynthia Stewart, Office Manager and Administrative Assistant, said, “With the incorporation of the iPad in many classes this year, we [also] anticipated that more students would prefer electronic books over textbooks.” “[Follett] allows returning students to get their books ordered online before they arrive on campus. I think students appreciate being able to see all their books, and teachers can easily check and make any changes online if they decide to require another book,” said Patricia Russell, Dean of Studies. However, some students were unable to receive their books from Follett on time for the first day of classes. According to Russell, it has always been the case that some students have trouble getting certain books on time, because of out-of-stock orders and unexpected changes for books for courses. New students, who could not order their books until their schedules were finalized, also received late orders. “I think there were a couple of cases where we assumed that more students would order more electric versions of the text, but more of them happened to order the text version, so Follett didn’t have certain books in stock,” said Russell. She expects the service to be more efficient and accurate in the upcoming terms. Students are also welcome to try other modes of purchasing books for the school year, such as ordering through Amazon, said Russell. As there is no long-term contract with Follett, Russell hopes to receive feedback from students, parents and faculty after the end of Fall Term and the beginning of Winter Term to access the pros and cons of the service. Russell said that it was a difficult decision for the Academy to end the partnership with the bookstore. “We incredibly value having the bookstore nearby in Andover, but it is obviously a different kind of business than those that work online, and more and more people are accustomed to shopping online these days,” she said. Although the bookstore will no longer supply Andover’s textbooks, it will continue to sell Andover logo merchandise.\n\n', 'Sep 11, 2014'), ('\nOn Tuesday, Independent and Democratic voters in Massachusetts’s Sixth District chose Seth Moulton ’97 as their party’s Congressional Candidate.\n Moulton unseated incumbent Democratic Congressman John Tierney and will face Republican Richard Tisei in the general election on November 4. Massachusetts’s Sixth District contains most of Essex County and parts of Andover, including Phillips Academy. \n Moulton took the primary by 8 percent of the vote over Tierney, marking the first time in 22 years that a Massachusetts Democrat has taken a seat from a congressman of his own party, according to the Boston Globe.\n After graduating from Andover, Moulton majored in Physics at Harvard University, but showed an early passion for public service when he entered Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as a Marine following his graduation. \n Moulton served two tours of duty in Iraq as a Platoon Commander, saw combat in the Battle of Najaf and worked to establish an independent Iraqi media. At the request of General Petraeus, Moulton served two additional tours as a liaison to senior Iraqi leaders and Iraqi security forces. \n “I saw terrible things that I will never forget. I also saw incredible joys that I will always remember. I don’t think life is ever the same after you’ve been shot at,” said Moulton on his service in Iraq at a 2009 Memorial Day All-School Meeting at Andover. \n Although Moulton served in the Iraq War, he was firmly against it. “I didn’t support the war in Iraq, but it was my duty to serve and I would not have wanted someone else to have to go in my place. Congress didn’t know what they were doing when they sent us to war in Iraq, and didn’t have our backs when we were there,” wrote Moulton in his Democracy for America endorsement application. \n Following his service in Iraq, Moulton completed a dual degree program at the Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School. \n While Moulton then dabbled in transportation and healthcare, he ultimately returned to public service. Not only was Moulton unhappy with Congress’s actions during the Iraq War, he was also disappointed with the record of his hometown district’s Congressman, Democrat John Tierney, calling him a “do-nothing congressman who hasn’t passed one bill in 18 years” while speaking by the campus of Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in May. \n In July 2013, Moulton announced his candidacy for Congress, emphasizing his military background and ability to “get things done.” “Congress has been making excuses. I am not here to make excuses, I am here to get things done; and if I am sent to Congress and I don’t get things done, then you should replace me,” said Moulton in an article in “The Daily News of Newburyport.” \n Moulton found wide support for his campaign from the Andover community. Andover Alumni Trustees Tom Israel ’62, Tom Beaton ’73, Christopher Auguste ’76 and Tammy Murphy ’83 have all made contributions to Moulton’s campaign. Several Andover faculty members have made contributions as well. Overall, Moulton has had a successful fundraising campaign, raking in over $1.8 million in his Congressional bid so far. \n Moulton’s Andover support has come not only in financial contributions but also in the trust of staff members, volunteers and interns. Jeff Phaneuf, a Marine Platoon Commander and Moulton’s Campaign Manager, is a former History Teaching Fellow who taught at Andover from 2010-2011. \n “I met Seth when I was a Senior in college. I was considering going into teaching, but I also considered going into the Marines. I got to know Seth through my Phillips Academy and Marine connection, and I have come to support Seth because we need a Marine in Congress who will put country above partisan politics,” said Phaneuf. \n Haley Scott ’11, formerly a Field Intern for Moulton and now a Field Coordinator, is in charge of “voter outreach, organizing volunteers and creating grassroots support for [Moulton’s] campaign” in ten towns in Massachusetts’s Sixth District, including Andover. \n Scott supports Moulton “because he embodies the ethic of ‘Non Sibi’ that Andover attempts to instill in all of its students,” she said.\n “He is a model of selflessness. He joined the Marines out of Harvard because he was passionate about service and he is running for Congress because of that same passion,” she said.\n Michael Adams ’15, Billy Casagrande ’15, Taylor Chin ’14, Madi Katz ’17 and Jay Tucker ’14 served as Field Interns for Moulton, and Kailash Sundaram ’15 served as a Finance intern.\n Katz said, “I support Seth Moulton because I think he brings the kind of leadership that is necessary to help change Congress’s stagnant state. This summer I called hundreds of people in the Sixth District to tell them about [Moulton], and I went door-to-door doing the same.”\n The money has translated directly into a large media buy and direct mailing outreach. Following the release of three advertisements, endorsements from seven major regional and local newspapers, including “The Boston Globe,” “The Boston Herald” and “The Salem News,” and a strong debate showing on August 14, Moulton is preparing to contend with Tisei come November. \n “I believe we’ve run an incredible campaign and have proven that newcomers still have a place in our political system. I can’t say which way it will go on Election Day, but I feel very good about our chances and confident that we’ve made a real difference,” said Scott. \n If Moulton wins the Congressional race, he will be the only current Andover graduate in Congress. A four-year Andover student from Marblehead, Mass., Moulton participated in Andover Crew and was a Sports Editor for The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Sep 11, 2014'), ('\nIn the wake of the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010, a man named Desulme continue his master craft; painting with a piece of cloth for a canvas and twigs for a brush in the streets of Port au Prince . Intrigued by Desulme’s work, Won Woo Kim ’15 stumbled through the rubble strewn about the sidewalks to ask, “How long does it take you to paint one of your paintings?” “One year,” Desulme said. Kim would later discover that Desulme’s answer was a result of the lack of art supplies he could afford. Inspired by artists like Desulme’s dedication to their craft in light of the disaster, Kim would go on to co-found the Haiti Arts Relief Project (HARP), a non-profit social enterprise that aims to support amatuer Haitian artists and promote the growth of art in Haiti. “[Even though] we were surrounded by damaged buildings, ashes and UN troops cleaning stuff out of the streets, there were still those paintings that hung on the sidewalks… that’s what got to me,” said Kim. As part of his effort to help Haitian arts, Kim purchases paintings from amateur artists and brings them back to the United States and Korea to be sold in art exhibitions. With the help of partners Kent McLaughlin ’15, Austin Robichaud ’15 and Jack Harrington ’15, all proceeds are reinvested into other projects in the island nation. One of such projects is the HARP Art School, a boarding school founded in 2012 dedicated to the development of the artistic talent of its 60 teenage students. “The HARP Art School’s purpose was to engender a future generation of Haitian amateur artists who aspire to become famous worldwide through the publicity that HARP will offer, and will also contribute their artworks to HARP Art Exhibition,” said Kim. According to Kim, HARP has recently finished the construction of dormitories on the school’s campus. Starting this fall, students will board with instructors at the school to facilitate a better learning environment. “We want to liven the artistic heritage of Haiti by motivating young, aspiring artists and providing them with the proper art education,” he continued. In addition to the HARP Art School, Kim’s organization sponsors orphans in Haiti and raises money for the construction of showers in ten villages throughout Haiti. HARP is currently organizing an art exhibition in Maine. With the funds generated from this event, Kim hopes to follow through with HARP’s next big venture: to merge the HARP Art School with Haiti’s National Sports Academy. After meeting with Jean Max Saint-Albin, the Director General of the Ministry of Sports and Civic Action, over the summer, it was agreed that the HARP Art School’s cultural instructions and teachings would help to truly educate a portion of Haiti’s youth. “The Minister had never encountered an art school in Haiti before, and so, by merging HARP Art School with the National Sports Academy, he wants to create a balanced curriculum, so the students can get a [complete] upbringing—a luxury in Haiti,” said Kim. HARP has won multiple awards for its efforts, including the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Award from the Department of History and Social Science at Phillips Academy, and The President’s Volunteer Service Award, gold level. HARP has also brought several speakers to the Andover campus, including Dr. Anthony Bogues of Brown University.\n\n', 'Sep 11, 2014'), ('\n **New Patio between Elson Art Center and Kemper Auditorium**\nThe brick pathway between Elson Art Center and Kemper Auditorium has been transformed into a courtyard over the summer, creating a welcoming space for students and faculty to socialize.\nWhile the idea of expanding the pathway to a larger piazza was first discussed by the administration two years ago, the renovation of the courtyard became a priority when the pine needles from the old pine trees outlining the pathway became a safety hazard.\nThe Campus Design Review Committee decided upon a model looking to maximize the space. Curved, granite seat walls now outline the enlarged courtyard and younger trees have been planted to create a “green” atmosphere.\n“The curved granite seat walls were designed such that they invited people to sit or stand around and use the space—the old courtyard didn’t have anything that was welcoming or inviting,” said Larry Muench, Director of Facilities.\n“We also didn’t have the size. Now, the enlarged space can also hold all the people in Underwood. After a meeting there, they can come outside and use the patio to continue their conversations,” he continued.\nLouis Elson ’80, P’12, P’15, P’17, Charter Trustee, funded approximately half of the budget, while the other half was taken from the annual budget preserved for facility renovations.\n“[It was a] couple of years in the making and it only took the summer to complete the construction. It’s a beautiful jewel on campus,” said Muench.\n**Rebecca M. Sykes Health and Wellness Center**\nConstruction of the Rebecca M. Sykes Health and Wellness Center, which will combine the health and counseling services currently provided by Isham Center and Graham House, began this past June and is projected to be completed by December of 2015.\n“We wanted to do [a lot of the work] early on during the summer so that we could connect all these utilities to the building without interrupting anything on campus when school resumed,” Muench said.\nThe construction area on Salem Street between Bulfinch Hall and Benner House is currently fenced and will remain so until the construction is complete.\nCounseling and current Graham House facilities will be located on the ground floor, while Isham health services will be on the second. Two large rooms will also be available to hold fitness classes and seminars. Training facilities and service will remain at Borden Gym.\nThe new wellness center is designed to represent a “beacon,” according to Muench. The top portion of the building, including the chimney, will be made of glass and will light up in the evening.\n“The masonry and the brick walls will blend in with the older Benner House and Bulfinch, while the glass chimney and the green roofs on top will add modern touches to it,” said Muench.\nThe Wellness Center’s location is ideal because it is close to the center campus, allowing students to get the help they need in between classes, according to Muench.\n“It was not efficient to have our medical [services] in one corner and counseling services in another, and the key was that the students were never really in those areas in the first place. The goal was to find a place that would fit both facilities under the same roof,” Muench continued.\n**Campus Expansion**\nIn an effort to accommodate the growing number of faculty members, Andover purchased 3.7 acres of land adjacent to Siberia and the ice rink this past summer. The school hopes to renovate the houses currently on the property to create five new faculty residences, according to Muench.\n“This is a piece of land that is directly contiguous to our playing fields, so it’s strategically a sensible parcel for us to own. And these parcels don’t come on the market all that often… and so when owner [James] Berberian approached us and asked if we were interested [because] we had an appropriate alignment with our needs, and it seemed like a great opportunity,” said Head of School John Palfrey.\nRenovating the pre-existing houses on this newly purchased property to make them lead-free was a more economic option than building new houses from scratch for the school, according to Palfrey.\nWhile there have been previous concerns regarding possible toxic sludge disposal in the property and health concerns accompanying it, the area is now safe to reside in.\n“We have a full-time environmental health and safety manager on staff, who has been tracking lots of environmental issues, including the issues with the site. We certainly would not have bought it if we weren’t 100 percent confident it was a safe place,” said Palfrey.\nAndover paid $4.2 million to purchase the land, and the construction is expected to begin in February of 2015, according to the “Andover Townsman.”\n\n', 'Sep 11, 2014'), ('\nDescribed by students as “anonymous Twitter,” the mobile application “Yik Yak” allows students to interact with others within a given geographic hotspot to post “yaks,” short snippets talking about absolutely anything. While some “yaks” are simply humorous, some Andover students have used the anonymous platform to post degrading and destructive content. “The words that I have read on ‘Yik Yak’ make me very sad and disappointed in our student body — even though I know it may represent only one person,” wrote Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, in an email to The Phillipian. “Anonymous posting strikes me as cowardly. If you cannot take responsibility for your words, then they shouldn’t be said or written,” he continued. Head of School John Palfrey addressed the issue in Wednesday’s All-School Meeting. He said that heads of schools similar to Andover have considered banning “Yik Yak” from their campuses. “It’s really not that hard to ban it. We can make a rule about it; we can use technology to geofence; we can grab all your phones and make sure you take it off. There are lots of solutions to this problem. I don’t like those solutions, Andover: they’re dumb. There’s going to be another app. There’s going to be another thing. You’ll figure out how to get around geofencing soon enough. Why do we need ‘Yik Yak’?” said Palfrey at ASM. Palfrey’s solution to the application is to strip “Yik Yak” of its influence. “If nobody uses it, then it doesn’t matter… If it’s one tree falling in the forest, if one person wants to be nasty and anonymous, then let them do it. It won’t have any power,” he said. “Think of this year and what you want to spend your time on. I don’t think it is on being nasty to other people, students, teachers and faculty members.

Following the release of three advertisements, endorsements from seven major regional and local newspapers, including The Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, and The Salem News, and a strong debate showing on August 14th, Moulton has made strong inroads on Tierney. By September 3rd, an Emerson College Poll showed that Moulton was only three points behind Tierney.

It’s been a really great atmosphere just getting to know so many different people on so many different levels. I’m a house counselor too, so I get to see people in a different way. Most adults see the kids in the classroom, and I get to see everybody on the sports field and in the training room and also in the dorm,” said Mattia.\nMattia’s position at Andover was her first job after graduating from Quinnipiac University in 2011. Having completed clinical rotations during her Senior year of college at prep schools such as the Hopkins School in New Haven, CT, Mattia found herself loving Andover’s environment from the start.\n“When I was figuring out what I wanted to do after my Senior year of college, I really liked the prep school atmosphere. I had done clinical rotations in my athletic training major with other prep schools and I really liked it. I was kind of looking for something like that and my family is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, so I figured this was a great first job to get into,” said Mattia.\n“What attracted me to the prep school world is that it was still a high-paced environment but not so much as a college level. I love working with students and being able to teach kids new things while treating their injuries. It’s a very fun atmosphere,” she continued.\n“Being my first job I was really nervous coming into it. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect coming into such a big place. But my confidence, ability to work with others and communication just skyrocketed when I came here. The supportive nature of this place really helped me with that.

There’s stress, but people are usually happy to be playing sports, and I really love being surrounded by that, so I think I’m going to miss that,” said Mattia.\nWhile she is still searching for a part-time job for next year, Mattia knows that graduate school is in her near future. She will stay busy next year taking classes in organic chemistry, biochemistry and microbiology to prepare her for graduate school and hopefully a Master’s in nutrition.\n“Everything that I’ve learned here, just the confidence and just the way people work here and the supportive nature, is going to go with me wherever I go.

I especially loved teaching here because every group of students is from everywhere, and teachers from other schools envy us for having a small group of really smart students who can speak from personal experiences about so many different parts of the planet,” Shaw said.\nIn addition to teaching History 100 and 300, Shaw previously directed the Outdoor Pursuits program for seven years. He was also in charge of the International Academic Partnership (IAP), a worldwide partnership program that focuses on professional development for teachers and curriculum development across many different disciplines such as Islamic cultural studies and global economics.\nDuring his time at Andover, Shaw has also served as House Counselor of many different dorms, including Foxcroft, Bartlett, Carriage House, Paul Revere Hall, Stowe House and Hearsey House.\nThough Shaw looks forward to immersing himself in a different community at St. George’s School, he said he will truly miss the profound and intellectual conversations he shared with Andover students.\n“There is no question that I [will] miss my students the most. I think the conversations we are having here right now about gender, race and class are the most important conversations we could be having as a learning community. The kind of conversations we are having at this campus are so high level, emotionally wrenching, and intellectually rich,” he said. Shaw hopes to bring these conversations to St. George’s and challenge students there with similar issues.\nThroughout his time at Andover, Shaw has always looked forward to September.\n“I think one of my favorite moments every year is when I meet and start to teach the History 100 class. There’s that moment when we are all brand new and all nervous. My students have loads of expectations of what I’ll be like and I have very few expectations of what they’ll be like, but there’s always a crispness to that moment that I love,” said Shaw.\nOne of the most significant contributions Shaw has made was overseeing the redevelopment of the History 100 and 200 curriculums.\n“Under Tony Rotundo, [Instructor in History and Social Science]’s leadership, a group of history teachers have taken a really close look at how we teach History 100 and 200 and why we are teaching it.

It is a difficult game to play well; it has a high failure rate. If you get a hit three out of 10 times up, you’re considered a terrific hitter. It’s also mentally demanding and difficult to teach,” said Drench.\n“When everybody pulls together and exceeds their expectations – and its not only about winning games, but becoming a real team – it becomes a peak experience.

Being able to form relationships with some of those people and students has been a triumph.”\nHaving already worked with children while as a Mental Health Counselor in the In-Patient Psychiatric Unit at Boston Children’s Hospital, Neal came to Andover with the goal of connecting more with adolescents, a group of people with which he was not used to working.\n“The demographics of the patients we see [at the Boston Children’s Hospital] that are students is pretty acute. And so I was looking for different opportunities to interact with students who have psychiatric issues in an academic setting. Academia has always been an important part of my life and finding a way to blend the two was something I was looking for,” said Neal.\nIn addition to maintaining his job at the Boston Children’s Hospital and his internship at Graham House, Neal graduated this May with a Master’s degree in Professional Counseling at Lesley University.\nNeal’s year at Andover also coincided with an exciting year personally: In October he got married, and he and his wife are now expecting their first child. These commitments and events have kept Neal busy throughout the whole year.\n“Balancing two jobs and school has been very difficult. There’s been so many opportunities that have been presented to me to take part in a bigger way on campus and often times I had to turn those opportunities down because I was either working or at school,” said Neal.\n“My weeks were like 65-hour weeks or something, so there’s been very little time for anything else. That’s probably my biggest regret and one thing I wish I could go back and change would be to free up some time to get more involved on campus,” he continued.\nAfter leaving Andover, Neal will work at Northfield Mount Hermon School (NMH) in Gill, Mass.\n“[NMH] will be an opportunity to really kind of come into my professional own and develop my style. It’ll be an opportunity to kind of make good on some of the missed opportunities at Andover. So being involved in some of the extracurricular activities, running an after-school group and really becoming a part of the community in a way that I wasn’t able to at Andover,” said Neal.\n“I am interested in participating in any group the students of NMH are interested in starting. Whether formal or informal, affinity groups are essential to developing one’s sense of community. During my time at Andover, I’ve learned that one’s sense of membership in a community is fundamental to one’s happiness as well as a key variable in students’ success at boarding schools,” he added.\nNeal’s experience at Andover has proved invaluable for his professional development.\n“I think my work at Graham House is foundational and that it pretty much sets the tone or the groundwork for everything I’ll do in the future.

I will always have deep feelings for this place,” said Rotundo.\nDuring his years at Andover, Rotundo most frequently taught History 200 and 300 classes, as well as an elective course on gender studies for Seniors. He has also served as Chair in History, Course Head of History 200 and Co-Head of History 300 with Vic Henningsen ’69, former Instructor in History.\nAside from his roles within the History Department, he has also spent 10 years as the Co-Director of the Brace Center and 15 years as the House Counselor of Stuart North House in Pine Knoll.\nRotundo believes that one of his most profound contributions to the school was in the mid 90s, when he served as a chair of a steering committee that the Trustees had appointed to try to determine what the future program for the next 20 to 25 years at Andover should look like.\n“We discussed the academic, residential, athletic and extracurricular aspects of Andover and the ways that they all connected and related to one another. Some of the changes we’ve proposed had been put into place and created important changes. The strategic planning committee that’s at work right now is using a lot of our ideas in their work. That was probably the greatest collaborative experience I’ve ever had,” said Rotundo.\nRotundo’s long history with Andover began when his wife, Kathleen Dalton, Instructor in History, started teaching at Andover in 1980. Rotundo was hired a year later, and for 15 years they were also co-workers in the History Department.\n“It was really great that the school was able to offer us that model. Our idea was we would use the extra time we had to write and publish our books, but when our kids were born, we ended [up] using the extra time to look after our kids,” said Rotundo.\nRotundo believes that his greatest accomplishment was managing his family life amidst the hectic lifestyle that Andover demands.\n“Talk to any [Andover] couple and they’ll tell you that it takes a lot of work and patience to make things work and work well. My marriage has been a source of just endless pleasure, and my kids — who both went to [Andover] — are just great people. They’re interesting and funny, and I truly love spending time with them,” said Rotundo.\nIn the next chapter of his life, Rotundo will devote his time as a historian to research and writing, particularly on “how masculinity for white men changed in the second half of the 20th century and how that connects up to politics and the lives of political conservatives.” This will be his second time writing a book, following the publication of his first book, “American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity From the Revolution to the Modern Era,” which is still being taught in college courses today, in 1993.\nHowever, he will also devote time to his friends and family.\n“I have lots of close friends from before coming to [Andover] that I don’t spend as much time with anymore and while we’re all young enough to be healthy and visit each other, I really wanted time in my life to enjoy those kinds of things,” said Rotundo.\nThough Rotundo is eager to pursue his passion for writing, he said he will miss the classroom and the daily interaction with his students and colleagues.\n“I’ll surely miss the everyday social contact I have with my students and getting to meet a lot of really interesting and cool people in my classroom each year. I’ve also got a lot of really exciting, interesting and enjoyable colleagues that I will miss,” said Rotundo.\n“But I definitely won’t miss those big stacks of papers on my desk, screaming at my conscience that it’s time to get them corrected, and the feeling of always trying desperately to catch up and never getting caught up,” he added.\nThroughout his time at Andover, one of Rotundo’s most memorable experiences was outside the classroom, when he helped sell a box of 500 “Feminist” t-shirts with his students involved in last year’s feminism movement, in addition to having profound conversations with students regarding issues of race, gender and sexuality.\n“We ordered a box of 500 t-shirts and they were all gone after 15 minutes. I got home at the end of the day and thought to myself: ‘Did that just happen?’ During that time I also enjoyed having conversations with students and faculty on race and gender, which have always been great concerns of mine,” said Rotundo.\nChristopher Shaw, Instructor and Chair in History, said, “Rotundo has forged a new path for teachers and scholars at Andover. He almost single-handedly established a new sub-discipline from his groundbreaking work, [‘American Manhood,’] in men’s studies within the broader discipline of gender and women’s studies.”\n“For 33 years, he has been an unrelenting advocate and inspiration for his students and a creative and generous colleague in the Department of History and Social Science,” Shaw added.\n\n', 'Jun 10, 2014'), ('\nFall Term would not be the same without the familiar sea of blue, yellow, orange, red and green tie-dye t-shirts and screams of the Blue Keys as they welcome the year’s new students to campus. On September 6, 2013, they did just that, beginning the 2013-2014 year on a high note.\nLess than two weeks after classes commenced for the fall term, Andover’s Mathematics Department began a historic partnership with Khan Academy, a non-profit educational company, to help produce a free online calculus course. After students enrolled in Math 590 generated calculus questions and videos last spring for Khan Academy as a trial, the calculus course quickly saw success, generating hundreds of thousands of views without any promotion.\nTwo weeks later, the administration clarified its policy on behavior at dances. This resulted in the explicit banning of grinding, as well as the implementation of a policy allowing chaperones to turn away any students deemed “not adequately clothed.”\nThe majority of students reacted negatively to this policy, as 82 percent of responses to a Phillipian survey were opposed to the stricter regulations.\nAndover history was made only a short few two weeks later when Andover’s Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) celebrated its 25th anniversary with its first ever Gay Pride Parade. Along with the parade, the Addison Gallery of American Art held an exhibit showcasing artwork by several LGBTQ artists, as well as a presentation and film screening by Mickalene Thomas, a New York-based filmmaker.\nNovember featured one of the more memorable All-School Meeting (ASM) lectures of the year, as Hafsat Abiola ’92 returned to campus to discuss her upbringing in Nigeria and the difficulties she has overcome. Two days before Abiola’s graduation from Harvard College, her mother, a human rights advocate in Nigeria, was assassinated. Two years later, Abiola’s father, President-elect of Nigeria Moshood Abiola, died while imprisoned by an oppressive military regime. Abiola has devoted her life to the fight for civil rights in Nigeria.\nThat same week Abiola, along with George Church ’72 and Frank Stella ’54, were awarded with Andover’s Alumni Award of Distinction. According its statement of purpose, the award seeks to recognize and honor Phillips Academy or Abbot Academy alumnae/i “who have served with distinction in their fields of endeavor.”\nAt around the same time, another famous figure visited campus. Paul Rusesabagina, the hero of the renowned film “Hotel Rwanda,” came to discuss his experiences and role in the Rwandan genocide. Rusesabagina was able to bribe the Hutu militants to leave alone the Tutsi refugees, in the process saving over 1,200 lives.\nJust one week later came the highly anticipated Andover/Exeter Weekend for Andover athletes, which brought triumph for Andover Football. After the team’s undefeated season two years after earning a 0-6 record, this year’s Andover/Exeter matchup was one to see. With 31 seconds left in the game, Ryder Stone ’14 carried the ball across the goal line, securing a 13-12 victory over Exeter. In the process, Andover ended its five-year losing streak against the Big Red. A week after Andover/Exeter, Andover Football carried its momentum into the NEPSAC Jack Etter Bowl, besting Brunswick 35-28 and capping off a perfect 9-0 championship.\nAfter students went home for Thanksgiving Break a week after Andover/Exeter day, they were first greeted with a full lineup of final exams in the Smith Center. Because of last year’s decision by the Andover administration to make three terms of equal length, Fall Term was confined to a mere ten weeks, as opposed to the 12-week terms most Andover students were accustomed to. Given this change in routine, students grinded through Extended Period before Thanksgiving Dreak and drew a sigh of relief during vacation.\n\n', 'Jun 10, 2014'), ('\nIn light of recent room visitation policy changes, many students have been left wondering what improvements have been made to the sexual education curriculum at Andover since Head of School John Palfrey announced his intent to rework the program last spring. It may be happening behind the scenes, but new plans for more formalized sexual education at Andover, including a comprehensive four-year health curriculum, are currently being developed for implementation, according to Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director of Isham Health Center.\n “It’s not just that people are talking and nothing is getting done. I do believe that this will be addressed, but this is going to take some creativity and it will take a real analysis of what we want students of Phillips Academy to graduate with, what skills and what knowledge,” said Patel.\n At the earliest, the four-year model which will include a sexual education component, will not be implemented until the 2015-2016 school year. \n Last spring, Palfrey created the faculty-composed Sexual Education Working Group to investigate and identify possible changes to the sex ed curriculum at Andover. Over the past year, the group has convened to investigate what the school currently offers, and what might be an ideal sexual education curriculum, according to Patel.\n For now, the group is looking to expand current offerings and form pilot programs.\n “We have been trying to pilot things because right now it takes a bit more time and many other people to be able to change the schedule. If we are going to change the daily schedule, if we are going to change requirements, that takes a lot of time.”\n One of these pilot programs, a series of non-mandatory 90-minute seminars about healthy relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and rape, began this spring. Aptly called Senior Spring Fever, the seminars were aimed at giving Seniors vital information they would need after graduation.\n “Unfortunately there was not a lot of student interest. I’m sure it is just a busy time of year and it is hard to say that students will dedicate three one and a half hour sessions to something. I do think that the students who participated felt that it was really helpful and a really invaluable opportunity for them,” said Patel.\n This past year, Isham staff members and other health educators on campus visited dorms as part of an initiative to facilitate discussions over sexual health issues in parietal talks.\n “Now that we are building a staff that feels very comfortable having these conversations and that faculty house counselors are asking and know that we are willing to do this, I think that we could probably cover all of the dorms that want to have a conversation with us next year,” said Patel.\n In regards to the new policy that requires upperclassmen to have their light on and doors open during room visits, Patel believes that the new policies should not inform the sexual health education, but rather both should inform and shape each other. \n “I do not think that the people who are developing the policies and the people who are developing the education are at odds with each other. I talked to my faculty colleagues and they were all saying the same thing and so I don’t see this being a big disconnect, I just think that some of the conversations that have been happening might not be so obvious [to students],” said Patel.\n While Patel said that sexual activity is natural for adolescents, she stands by the school’s stance that sex is inappropriate at Andover.\n “There are benefits and risks, and I am not one to say that abstinence is the only way to go. There are benefits to sexuality,” said Patel. “We are not saying you are not adolescents with hormones and curiosity. That is all a normal part of growing, so we don’t want to stop that. But we can’t say that it is appropriate at school.”\n Despite the policy change, Isham Health Center will continue to offer the same reproductive health services such as birth control, Plan B and condoms, according to Patel.\n Currently, Andover students who enter as Juniors or Lowers receive sex education in one class of Physical Education (PE), three Lower Personal and Community Education (PACE) classes, Biology classes and dorm meetings about room visits, according to Patel.\n\n', 'Jun 2, 2014'), ('\nFollowing a faculty vote on four proposals regarding room visits, _The Phillipian_ opened two anonymous surveys to the student body and the faculty on Tuesday, May 27 2014.

Two of the proposals would be implemented in the 2014-2015 school year: the Upper sign-in proposal, which did not pass, and revised hours for ninth grade room visits, which passed. The other two proposals addressed new room visiting hours for upperclassmen and a requirement for all students to keep their lights on and their doors ajar during room visits, both of which were approved by an overwhelming majority.\nThe House Counselor Committee consists of Lani Silversides, Keith Robinson, Kathy Birecki, Scott Hoenig, Shawn Fulford, Christina Landolt, Jill Thompson, Matt Lisa and Paul Murphy.\nHouse Counselor Committee members responded to questions about the newly approved room visit policies.\n_ **The Phillipian:** _ \xa0 **The 29.5 hours of possible parietal time was reduced to 19.5 hours under the new policy for Uppers and Seniors. How was this decided?**\n**Lani Silversides, House Counselor in Bancroft**\nWe weren’t actually considering the total number of hours… We wanted the room visiting hours to more directly reflect when the faculty members were on duty, which starts at 8 p.m. We decided that it was more reasonable to start the hours when house counselors were actually present in dorms to grant parietals.\n**Scott Hoenig, House Counselor in Rockwell**\nWhen voting on the Junior room visiting hours, many faculty members noted that room visits were not happening frequently during weekdays anyway. I have been in Rockwell for 11 years, and I have had maybe one handful of individuals requesting room visits during the 5-8 p.m. time slot during weekdays. However, over the last two years we have instituted an experimental hour on Friday nights from 8:30-9:30pm for Juniors, and we have had multiple kids using parietals during those times. We think that it’s appropriate and healthy for ninth graders to have room visits. Ultimately we decided to eliminate hours that they aren’t using anyways and add an hour and a half on Fridays when they would actually use them.\n**_The Phillipian: _What was the rationale behind requiring that lights remain on during all room visits?**\n**Silversides**\nCurrently, there are not specifications as to whether or not lights have to be turned on or off during room visits, so different dorms were doing different things. We’ve been hearing from a lot of both students and faculty over the last couple of years through surveys and discussions that people felt awkward going down the hall. Your dorm is your home, and it should be a safe space, where everyone is comfortable to walk down the hallway or going in and out of showers. If a student sees a door ajar with the lights turned off and you’re thinking their dorm mates are having sex behind the doors, they may feel sufficiently awkward. I think having the lights turned on will reduce the awkwardness.\n**Hoenig**\nThe faculty are in an ongoing conversation right now about sexual activity on campus. During the faculty meetings and various surveys it became apparent that there was a critical mass of faculty who wanted to have a rule that said the lights should be turned on and doors should be opened.\n_ **The Phillipian:** _ **What is your stance on sexual activity on campus?**\n**Silversides**\nI think we are still in a big conversation about sexual activity on campus, and different faculty members have different stances on the topic. My priority is to better educate students on sex. I think we are really trying to have better sex education on campus – for the first time this year we have a health educator on campus.\n**Shawn Fulford, House Counselor in Eaton Cottage**\nI have taken a hard line on this topic. I am very concerned for the chain of students who are in the hallway or in the community that are very uncomfortable with being surrounded by their peers engaging in sexual activity. They shouldn’t have to be exposed to the sexual activity of their peers…Another thing to note is that none of these changes are to prevent students from having discussions of these issues. We are completely open to hearing students’ input. That is one of the reasons why we are not implementing some of these changes (new hours for upperclassmen, lights on, doors ajar) until the fall of 2015. These policies were voted on but not intended to be implemented until then because we wanted students to have discussions within dorms and amongst themselves and faculty on how to adapt to these changes.\n**Matt Lisa, House Counselor in Stuart House**\nSex is a difficult issue for us, just speaking as a house counselor – I’m a house counselor over in Stuart, which is a large boys dorm – and do we feel comfortable as a faculty, or as individuals, providing a space that students can have sex? \xa0Is that the intent of granting a parietal? I think it’s one of these issues where students come from many different places and homes, and I think in the end, a lot of faculty feel like we want to be able to honor what might go on in a lot of homes of our students. \xa0When you really think about it that way, I think there are a lot of students whose families would not allow sex to occur in their home, or provide a space for that to happen. I’m sure there a lot of families that would [allow sex], so what side do we err on as a faculty?\n**Keith Robinson, House Counselor in Bishop Hall**\nI think they are separate issues [sex-ed on campus and the new room-visiting policies]…It’s probably a pretty important thing that we have a bunch of teenagers on campus, and we educate you in order to make choices in your life that will benefit you, and you will make informed decisions. That makes the education part really important. The room-visiting policy is not tied directly to that. I understand that the student body likes to tie it to that, but I think in a lot of ways we look at those as separate issues.\n\xa0\n_Bennett Michaels, Haley Suh and Erica Shin contributed reporting._\n\xa0\n\n', 'May 27, 2014'), ('\nOn Sunday, voting closed on a survey sent to the faculty involving four proposals related to room visitation policies. Approved changes include new room visiting hours for Juniors and upperclassmen, as well as a requirement for upperclassmen to leave their doors ajar and lights on during room visits.\n The survey invited faculty to share their thoughts and vote on the proposed changes. For the 2015-2016 school year, upperclassmen will have to keep their doors ajar in accordance with the newly passed policy. All students will be required to have their lights on during room visits as well. The measure passed with 61 percent of faculty in favor and 26 percent in opposition, while 13 percent abstained.\n Murphy said the change would require Seniors to have the door ajar to “the width of a recycle bin.”\n “The closed door is just a real sticking point for a lot of people, and I think it probably has run its course. In some ways, [the decision]’s late. It’s been on the to-do list,” said Murphy.\n A proposal to abolish 8 p.m. sign in for Uppers was rejected with 33 percent of faculty in favor, 54 percent opposed and 13 percent abstaining. The Upper sign-in proposal was initiated by Co-Presidents Junius Williams and Clark Perkin’s and was part of their campaign platform last year.\n Along with the new parietal rules, a set of room visiting hours for upperclassman was proposed and approved in the vote. Upperclassmen will be allowed to have room visits on weekdays from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Fridays from 8:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Saturdays from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. and Sundays from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m The policy will go into effect in the 2015-2016 school year. This change will decrease the total available time for room visits for upperclassmen from 29.5 hours per week to 19.5.\n In addition, new room visiting hours for Juniors will also come into effect. Come next Winter Term, Juniors will no longer be able to have room visits on weekdays, but will be allowed to have them on Fridays from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and Sundays from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.The new hours will give Juniors a total of 6.5 hours in one week during which they can request room visits, a reduction from the 17 hours per week currently. \n** Students respond to new room visit policies:\n> [@phillipsacademy](https://twitter.com/phillipsacademy) Regardless of current problems w/parietal system, I just don’t see how this is the first step for making kids feel safer.\n>\n> — Jaleel D (@JaleelDProblems) [May 27, 2014](https://twitter.com/JaleelDProblems/statuses/471136155329921025)> Students call for improved sex-ed, faculty respond by eliminating all safe spaces on campus to have sex.

It has been updated to include weekday parietal hours.\n_**\n\n', 'May 26, 2014'), ('\nHidden behind the brick walls of Isham lies a peaceful refuge unknown to most of campus: the Abbot-Phillips Community Garden.\nThe garden, which began three years ago by two students with an Abbot grant, has had a long history of ups and downs.\nThe fate of the garden was uncertain even before its construction, when the students lacked equipment to set up the garden. Upon hearing about the project, Elizabeth Poland, Instructor in French, took over the construction and management of the garden, choosing its present location and organizing its construction with the help of alumni and volunteers.\nAfter its completion, the garden enjoyed three years of success. The garden was able to produce over 250 pounds of food in its first year. Following its inaugural year, Poland and other garden participants made the decision to expand the garden’s focus.\nIn its second and third years, produce grown in the garden was donated to the Merrimack Valley Food Bank in Lowell, Massachusetts, a bank that distributes food to over 90 different shelters and kitchens in the Merrimack Valley.\n“We wanted a greater cause, which was essentially what we were looking for, and that was incredibly successful. [The Merrimack Valley Food Bank] was very grateful,” said Poland.\nTo help plant and harvest in the garden during the months of May through October, Poland enlisted the help of student summer interns, along with student groups on campus.\n“We had a lot of student volunteers, Praxis [Community Service as a Sport] groups and more. Even Aggie Kip’s yoga students participated. Community-service groups separate from Praxis helped prepare the garden. During the summer months, when most people weren’t here, we had sustainability interns working in the garden, harvesting, replanting for a second harvest,” said Poland.\n\xa0\n**The Problem**\nThis year, the garden ran into its second obstacle to success. After the Abbot grant seed money to begin the garden ran out, the garden had been operating with the Class of 1959’s fund, a fund designed to further environmental causes and projects on campus. In early 2014, however, this money was redirected away from the garden.\n“Now we are unfunded. And even though I have a ‘Non Sibi’ project in the garden preparing the beds for this season, I have no money, at all,” said Poland in an interview with The Phillipian on April 15.\nDesperate for funding to pay for the upcoming growing season, Poland searched through campus for a class or project which would have use for the garden.\n“I’ve shopped around for a department that might, like biology, community service — anybody who would take this on — with no luck. There’s definitely interest, there’s a lot of interest, there’s just not the ability to say ‘yes, we’ll take on your budget,’” said Poland during her April 15 interview.\nShe believes that the largest problem inhibiting funding was a lack of knowledge about the garden.\n“You can’t really see it very well, even from the road there, which is an issue, in that people don’t know it’s there,” Poland said.\n“A lot of prep schools have gardens; a lot of them even have farms. We’ve got one right here; I don’t want to see it die. I want it to develop, because we’ve put a lot of effort into it and really the hard part is over — we’ve created the garden; we’ve put up the fence. We just need to put some seeds into the ground and get some people working in it,” continued Poland.\n“It’s too bad that more people don’t know about the garden because it’s pretty cool that we are growing fresh fruit and vegetables on campus (there is a blueberry patch too),” wrote Willa Tellekson-Flash ’14, summer intern in the garden, in an email to The Phillipian.\n\xa0\n**The Solution**\nWorking with Debra Shepard, Director of Sustainability, Poland finally found a solution. On May 7, they opened up the garden’s soil to faculty and staff interested in gardening for the 2014 summer.\n“We wanted to incorporate the garden into the greater [Andover] community….When the garden only served the outside community (via the food bank donations), we found that many students, faculty and staff had little awareness of the garden on campus. We aim to correct that by involving more groups on and off campus,” said Poland in an email to The Phillipian.\nAs of Friday, May 16, 12 applicants had responded. Assigned via a lottery system, faculty and staff who receive a plot will gain the ability to plant any annual, non self-seeding, plant that is appropriate for the space on an 8’ by 4’ piece of land in the garden.\n“I’m excited that we got as many responses as we did. It sounds like, from their applications, that they were really excited to have this opportunity,” said Shepard.\nHalf of the garden will be portioned for the faculty and staff that receive plots, and the rest will be left for food bank plantings. Faculty and staff receiving land have either already begun to plant or will begin to plant this coming week, and members of Eco-Action will begin to plant the food bank section in their planting party event this Saturday.\n“We plan to plant potatoes, tomatoes, squash, basil, lettuce, eggplants and peppers in the food bank garden. I expect to donate at least 150 pounds of produce this season,” wrote Poland in an email to The Phillipian.\nFurthermore, day students were invited to work for 10-30 hours over the summer to fulfill their work duty requirements. So far, six out of the needed 15 students have responded.\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nFor many students at Andover, the Spotify and Soundcloud music that blares out of their earbuds in the Garver Room helps to make the study experience a little more bearable. For Scott MacDonald ’15, however, the noise is only a burden.\n “I’m really into music, and, if you personally know me, you’ll frequently hear me say that I don’t have time for it. Most people listen to music when they are doing other things, but when I put on music, I zone out everything that I’m doing and just sit there blank listening to music,” he said.\n MacDonald was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in eighth grade. ADHD affects his executive and cognitive functions, the ability to switch between tasks and focus, and the ability to recall memory in a short period of time.\n As part of this week’s Disability Weekend, MacDonald, Dylan Gully ’12, Andrew Faulkner ’07 and Carrie Ingerman ’15 recounted their personal experiences with learning and physical disabilities at the “No Shame in The Name: Celebration of Disabilities” student panel.\n Hosted by Disability Rights, Education, Activism and Mentoring (DREAM), a new club formed by Ingerman, the aim of the event — and the club — was to increase awareness on students with disabilities, as well as promote understanding and tolerance among members of the Andover community.\n Students with disabilities often have to find alternative ways to thrive in the competitive and demanding Andover environment. Gully, for example, cannot take notes and pay attention to the teacher at the same time during class.\n “If I do, I’ll do poorly in both. I haven’t taken notes in any classes. Ever. I just listen, so I have to listen very attentively,” said Gully, who was diagnosed with Dyslexia.\n “The most obvious [memory I had with my disabilities] in my life was in college when I pledged for a fraternity under a name from the novel ‘Of Mice and Men,’” said Faulkner, who is diagnosed with Dyslexia and ADHD.\n Unlike the other panelists, Ingerman has a physical disability and has been dealing with mobility impairments after three back surgeries in the course of ten months. Everyday actions such as sitting, standing or walking often prove difficult for Ingerman. \n “It’s really difficult for me because I remember being physically able. I miss playing sports and hanging out with friends after finishing homework. I don’t have the energy to spend as much time with friends now,” said Ingerman.\n Panelists strongly expressed the need to promote understanding and tolerance of those with learning and physical disabilities. MacDonald talked about how he receives 50 percent additional time for all of his exams, forcing him to split the tests in half or take them during free periods, conference or lunch.\n “At a competitive place like Andover, students take everything competitively. I’ve had someone ask me, ‘How do I get extra time?’ and I’ve had to awkwardly explain to them why I’m still taking the test when the teacher has called time,” said MacDonald.\n “I want people to realize how real [disabilities] are because they are not something tangible or clearly visible. I don’t want others’ misunderstanding of my disabilities to affect the way they view me,” said Gully.\n For Faulkner, having learning disabilities is not a hindrance. He shared that his disabilities have shaped who he is today and allowed him to succeed in ways that he wouldn’t have had otherwise.\n “At Andover, I was horrible at Spanish, so I focused more on math and other things that my strengths played to. Now I’m an engineer, and my focus on those other things have really helped me. I’ve become a better engineer because of my learning disabilities,” he said.\n Gully saw his disability as something to motivate him to do better. Before he came to Andover, Gully’s doctor sat him and his mother down and said that Andover would probably be too great of a challenge.\n “That moment really drove me to work harder and prove him wrong. He was the first person I thought of when I got my diploma,” he added.\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nEight students spoke at Monday’s Faculty Meeting to share their experiences of being an underrepresented student of color on the Andover campus, in Kemper Auditorium. The faculty later discussed the issues addressed after the students had left. Jason Young ’15, Jair Kornegay ’15, Janine Ko ’14, Katherine Vega ’14, Sydni White ’14, Kai Kornegay ’14, Devontae Freeland ’15 and Zainab Aina ’14 led the discussion. “The goal was to make sure that faculty knew about the experiences of underrepresented students of color. We wanted to bring to light something that might have gone unnoticed by the faculty but affects many of us,” said David Gutierrez ’15, 2014-2015 Student Body Co-President, who introduced the speakers at the meeting. “I hope that people took away from this that more racial awareness needs to be brought in this campus and when we do talk about race it should be in a productive and respectful manner,” said Gutierrez. The faculty remained in the auditorium after the presenters had left to further discuss the information and come up with means by which faculty could support the movement, which the students were hoping to achieve through their presentation. “The stories were all really powerful, and they were all addressing different things: from things explicit, like the casual use of the n-word, which actually cannot be used casually, or the clearly violent use of the word directed towards a particular black student, to things more implicit, like the ease at which a teacher’s acts in the classroom can inadvertently reinforce stereotype threats,” said David Fox, Instructor in English. “At one moment, after the students left, a veteran faculty member said, ‘On this stage, I remember when James Merideth was here and said, “I would have rather faced the racism I did in Mississippi than the racism my sons face here at Andover.”’ There was a lot of silence [after that] and we were invited to do so and process what we heard. After the faculty member shared that, there was a significant two, three, four minute silence,” said Fox. The students chose to address the faculty in person to express individual accounts and experiences of discrimination on campus. “By physically speaking in front of the faculty, we added an element of personality to it. With the original letter to the editor that the students wrote, that sparked More Than Just A Number and this conversation, it’s very easy to assume that it was the voice of all black students and all Latino students, but there was no personality to it no individuality,” said Devontae Freeland ‘15, one of the students involved in organizing the meeting. “One criticism I have of this institution is that it doesn’t have much of a focus; there are too many different things, and they are all put on equal standing, and so if this is important and we want to maintain momentum, then we need to make it a priority,” said Fox.\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nThis coming Sunday, voting will close on a survey sent to the faculty involving two major topics: the abolition of initial sign-in for Uppers and a reformation of the parietal hours for Juniors. The survey also featured questions inviting teachers to share their thoughts on several other topics, including general guidelines for dorms and policies about room visits for Seniors, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. If the vote passes for the reforming of parietal hours for Juniors, weekday parietals would be discontinued and the hours for Friday-night parietals would be extended. In addition, the hours for Sunday parietals would be shortened. According to Murphy, the goal of changing the parietal hours is to simplify the guidelines for Junior room-visiting and to take a more practical stance on which parietal time-slots are actually used by Juniors. “The purpose behind that is to be more real about what actually happens,” said Murphy. “Some [House Counselors] have been trying to make more normal this idea of girls and boys being in each other’s spaces.” This adjustment would be the most recent change to Junior parietals since the decision made several years ago to restrict Juniors from having parietals with students in other grades. “[We want to bring] the rule in mind with actual practice, rather than publishing all these hours that no one uses. Also, with a coupled idea that Friday might be something that we want to get better at,” said Murphy. The topic of abolishing initial sign-in for Uppers was brought to the attention of the faculty by Junius Williams ’14 and Clark Perkins ’14, School Co-Presidents, and the issue was discussed at length. “I think on some level, the bringing up of the Upper sign-in is stirring the pot a little, and it’s making people say, ‘What are we doing?’” said Murphy. Although the final decision will be made on Sunday after the survey closes, Murphy said, it seems unlikely that the faculty will pass the proposal. “I think people are not necessarily swayed by arguments of convenience. It has to make sense for some other reason,” said Murphy. Another issue raised in the survey was the policy regarding closed-door parietals for Seniors and whether or not the rules should be changed so that Seniors, like Uppers, are required to have the door ajar instead of shut during a parietal. Murphy said a change in the rules would not only require Seniors to have the door ajar to “the width of a recycle bin,” but to also leave the light on during the parietal. “The closed door is just a real sticking point for a lot of people, and I think it probably has run its course. In some ways, [the decision]’s late. It’s been on the to-do list,” said Murphy. Lastly, the faculty discussed whether or not students should be required to remain in their own rooms after 11 p.m. on school nights. “In this day and age of being tied into one another, do people really need to be in each others’ rooms? Is this contributing to long hours and late nights and people not getting sleep?” said Murphy. He continued, “I think the collection of five or six kids in someone’s room night after night [is] just a drag. And sometimes it leads to those kids getting tired and sick.” According to Murphy, many faculty feel that the changes to both the rules for Senior parietals and dorm guidelines would be beneficial to the Andover community. “Generally, students are not in favor of these changes, and generally faculty are in favor of them… On some level, you can probably guess where people are going to come down. I think they’re probably going to be in favor of both,” said Murphy. These changes, if passed by the faculty, would not be implemented until the 2015-2016 school year or later. “I think somewhere along the line there needs to be a conversation about where these [decisions] come from. Are they reasonable? Is change really that bad?” said Murphy. Looking towards the future, the possibility of an online sign-in system in the coming years is a distant — but not unreachable — prospect, according to Murphy. “I have this vision of six iPads in the library, and you just go in and you find your name, you say who you are, you take a picture, or something. … It’s a reasonable thing to say, ‘I’m in the library; I’m checking in,’” said Murphy. He continued, “In fact, I can see in five or 10 years, or maybe even less than that, some kind of way that you can sign-in in lots of different places.”\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nAs Spring Term comes to a close and textbooks shut and dorm rooms are emptied, Seniors look forward to the last day of finals. Later that evening, many will first walk promenade across campus, then head to the State Room in Boston for a night of photos, dinner and dancing. Every year, this special experience starts not on Prom night, but as Seniors begin asking their dates in fun and unique ways. Some decided to let the community join in on the fun by asking their dates publically in Paresky Commons, while others decided on a more private yet just as special “promposals.” This week, The Phillipian tracked down a few Prom couples to snatch their “promposal” stories. SLAMming Her Way into Her Heart Farris Peale ’14 also reached out to her friends to help ask her date, Kayla Thompson ’15, to Prom. Peale asked the Co-Heads of SLAM to perform one of their sideline cheers in Lower Right, adding in the words “Kayla” and “prom” to the typical chant. “SLAM came into Lower Right and did their routine. Then they parted and I walked through. I had brownies that said ‘prom’ on them because she wanted food to be involved somehow and so then I offered her the brownies. She actually didn’t say anything but I took it as a ‘yes,’” said Peale. “I was not expecting to be asked in this way. I was kind of speechless for a while but I was also really happy and excited. Nervous too because I wasn’t sure what she was going to do but I knew it was going to happen that week. And I was a little disorientated from walking around campus blindfolded for a while,” said Thompson. Ripped Shirts and Ripped Bodies Alec Tolentino ’14 brought the spirit of this year’s Andover Football team to Lower Right of Paresky Commons in asking Emma Crowe ’15 to Prom. “I got the boys from the football team to help me do the Haka, our ritual before every game this season. However, instead of Ilalio leading the haka, I learned the words and lead it myself. I was really looking for another reason to do the Haka again and this just seemed like the perfect reason,” said Tolentino. At the end of the Haka, Alec and five of his teammates ripped off their shirt to spell out “PROM?!” with the letter painted on their chests. Alec got down on one knee and handed Crowe a rose. “Emma really loved the Haka. I could tell how surprised, happy [and] excited she was because when I popped the question, she couldn’t speak, she could only nod. The look on her face was my favorite part of the whole thing,” Tolentino continued. Crowe wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I’m guessing he chose to do the haka because the couple of minutes following the Exeter football game were some of the most exciting and happy moments of our relationship, as cheesy as that sounds. He was so excited and I was so proud (and having heart palpitations) so it was a super memorable moment for both of us.” Haphephobia: The Fear of being Hugged Ben Yi ’14 employed his skills in moviemaking to ask Sam Goldberg ’14 to Prom. Yi created a short video entitled, “Why You Should Hug More, Sam Goldberg,” and gave it to his friend, Alex Tamkin ’14, to show in front of Goldberg and Tamkin’s Art 409: Video II class. “Sam and I have an inside joke about how she doesn’t like hugs. So I filmed a bunch of people hugging on campus, explaining satirically and scientifically why she should hug more often. After the video finished playing in her Video class, I, with the help of many friends, asked her to Prom by giving her flowers and cupcakes,” said Yi. Yi came into the classroom at the end of the video asking for a hug and a “yes” to the question “Will you go to Prom with me?” Goldberg said, “I actually was expecting to be asked during video class because my teacher told me she would give me three cuts if I missed class that day! But I had no idea the hugging video was coming.” Zombie Attack Taylor Chin ’14 asked Jamie Chen ’15, Editor in Chief of The Phillipian volume CXXXVII, by asking 20 of his friends to dress up as zombies and surround her while she was eating dinner in Paresky Commons. He got the idea from the TV show “The Walking Dead.” “I was dressed in a SWAT vest and a helmet, and I had a NERF gun. They went in and were converging on Jamie, and then I came in. I had a rose in my teeth, I shot all of the zombies, and I then asked her to Prom,” said Chin. To make the zombie attack seem as real as possible, Chin provided his friends with ripped shirts and pants. He also brought bottles of fake blood for his friends to smear across themselves. Chen wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “I didn’t expect something so elaborate and public, but it was perfect. It was funny, romantic, creative and totally a surprise. Taylor kept all his plans a secret from me, and I was actually getting pretty nervous and frustrated that it was taking him so long. It was definitely worth the wait.” 120 Seconds Grant Bitler ’14 asked Alec Kingston ’14 to Prom by taking her on a date inspired by an episode from the show “How I Met Your Mother,” which both Bitler and Kingston regularly watch. On the show, two of the characters go on a two-minute date, and Bitler organized a similar event for Kingston. “I set up a dinner that lasted twenty seconds, and a movie that lasted twenty seconds, and a stroll that was supposed to be a minute but actually lasted five seconds, and then a dance that was like two seconds,” said Bitler. Kingston said, “I was completely blown away because I had been bugging him for weeks [to ask me] and it was later than a lot of the other [asks]. It was nice because it was something that you couldn’t really Google or find on the Internet. ” Back to the Beginning Andrew Yang ’14 asked Emma Mehlman ’14 by spelling “Prom?” out in the newsroom with munchkins from Dunkin’ Donuts. Both Yang and Mehlman were News Editors of The Phillipian volume CXXXVI. “One of her friends suggested [the idea] to me, and I figured that I might as well do it in the newsroom because that is really where I met her and got to know her,” said Yang. Mehlman said, “Andrew and I have talked about going to Prom together for a long time throughout [our work on] The Phillipian. We went to Sadie [Hawkins Dance] together this fall, and then there was a little bit of confusion right at the beginning of when Prom-asks started. I think he thought that I was going to go with someone else.” “He also knows that munchkins are my favorite food,” she added. Cheesy in Every Way Trying to appeal to Maddalena Albera’s ’14 Italian roots, Zen Wolfson ’14 mixed both humor and food to ask her to Prom. “I know this is cheesy, but will you go to Prom with me?” said Wolfson with a large pizza in hand. Wolfson showed up to the Great Lawn where Albera and friends were sitting and presented her the pizza which had olives on it spelling out “PROM?” Wolfson also recruited friends to stand behind him holding up several other items of food. “My logic was that Maddie is Italian so I should do something that’s very Italian based. I went downtown and bought everything that seemed Italian. So I got a pack of bread because it said Italian on it, Milano cookies and a box of pasta. I had friends hold up the Italian stuff while I opened the pizza box and asked her to Prom,” said Wolfson. The plan almost got derailed because of a delayed pizza delivery. “I ordered from King’s, and it was like 30 minutes late. While I was waiting in my room for the pizza to come I was frantically messaging people to make sure she stayed where she was because it was kind of cold outside and people were starting to go inside. And then right when they were about to leave the pizza arrived and everything worked out fine,” said Wolfson. Personalized Campus Tour Dan Wang ’14 asked Emma Kukielski ’15 to Prom with a personalized tour that took the pair to significant places in their relationship. The tour started at CAMD where the two have spent a lot of time and moved to locations such as Bulfinch, Steinbach Lobby, the Flagstaff Quad and the path to Holt Hill. “I came up with the idea because I wanted something that showed how much I care about her. My first thought was a scavenger hunt full of inside jokes, but I decided I wanted something we could do together. And since we’re both Admissions Ambassadors, I decided to give her a tour!” said Wang. “My Precious” Renee Lamarche ’14 used another surprise approach to her prom-asking when she asked Rob Irvin ’15. “He is really into ‘Lord of the Rings,’ so I made this big banner that said, ‘Be the Gandalf to my Frodo.’ He rows crew, and I hung it off an overpass that they row underneath. He rowed by and saw it. He was really excited and happy, and he gave me a thumbs up to say yes,” she said. Irvin said, “I had no idea it was coming. As we were rowing under a bridge, my coxswain kept yelling at me to look up… The ‘Lord of the Rings’ reference was just icing on the cake.” He added, “All my coach said was: ‘Now we can start practice.’ It turned out he was in on it the whole time. Great wingman.” Better Late than Never! Stephen Moreland ’14, Editor in Chief of The Phillipian volume CXXXVI, hopes to ask Leah Shrestinian ’14 to Prom through this article. Moreland said, “Leah, will you go to Prom with me?” Shrestinian has yet to respond.\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nBeginning in the 2014-2015 school year, iPads will be required for all Juniors. All Lowers, Uppers and Seniors will be required to have a “tablet or portable laptop” that “must be able to connect to PA wireless and can be used in classes,” said Trish Russell, Dean of Studies. This decision was made after consultation with all departments, the Academic Council and the Senior Administrative Council. The requirement for Juniors to have iPads stems from the standardization of tablets in “most 100-level language courses,” as well as some sections of History 100 and Biology 100, said Russell. While it is required that students have the technology, Russell stressed that the technology might not be used in all situations and courses. “There is no mandate that teachers must utilize these tools in classes, but many faculty are clearly eager to take advantage and begin planning courses knowing that all students will have devices in their bags beginning in September,” said Russell. iPads were utilized in some courses this year, including chemistry, Russian and Spanish. Next year, the administration will be able to see how the iPads can effectively be used in all classrooms. “We will continue to gather data on this year’s expanded iPad pilot and see how having these devices in a wide range of classes this year influenced the teaching and learning,” said Russell. As part of a new iPad pilot initiative, 28 individual class sections incorporated iPads into their curricula during the 2013-2014 school year, according to a previous article in The Phillipian.\n\n', 'May 22, 2014'), ('\nNext year’s Brace Student Fellows, Avery Jonas ’16, Kaylee Llewellyn ’15, Ellie Simon ’15 and Cem Vardar ’15 will explore the topics of religion, culture, race and chess.\nThe Brace Center opened in 1996 and has been accepting Student Fellows since its founding.

I’ve noticed that they’re coming from the media. That’s why I wanted to research about the media, because it has a big impact on how black males actually think of themselves and others, and how the world views them,” said Jonas.\nWorking with Emma Staffaroni, Instructor in English, Jonas will focus his research on reflections on black masculinity, including the book “Black Looks” by bell hooks.\n**Cem Vardar ’15:**\nVardar’s project will examine at the culture in eastern Turkey that encourages child marriages.

Women lag behind in terms of receiving education and social services. They don’t have any say in terms of whether they want to marry these people or not, and some are just married off in return for money,” said Vardar.\nIn his research, he plans to work with non-governmental organizations trying to aid the situation, interview journalists who have worked in the field and travel to eastern Turkey to get first-hand accounts from people living in these cultures.

By the definition of polygamy, it can’t be an equal relationship between a man and a woman, because there are more women than men.

We are struggling in our classes, in the pages of The Phillipian and, particularly, in social media. I want to share with you this morning a few thoughts on this matter. There are two main things I offer this morning: one is simple, one is complex.\n First, the simple point. We, as a faculty, share a commitment to educate ‘Youth from Every Quarter.’ This concept is not new. It is enshrined in the Academy’s constitution. It dates back 236 years, and it is restated in our school’s Statement of Purpose, which I encourage you all to read with care.\n We, as a faculty, also know that you all chose to come to Andover. Over and over again, in survey after survey, you told us you have chosen Andover because of its diversity, not despite its diversity. The same is true, by the way, of our nation’s colleges and universities. In survey after survey on this topic, students tell researchers that they have chosen college X because, in no small part, of its diversity.\n Turn to your left, for a moment, and acknowledge who is sitting there. Now turn to your right, and acknowledge who that person is. Think now, for a moment, of yourself — yes, I am encouraging you not to be Non Sibi, but to be Pro Sibi for a moment. \n The simple point is: every single person in this chapel deserves to be here. You were chosen — for reasons that have nothing to do with your background and also for reasons that have everything to do with your background. We believe, as teachers, that each one of you has the potential to take full advantage of this school — and to become graduates of whom we can be exceedingly proud. Our admissions office does not make “mistakes.” Everyone who chooses to come to Phillips Academy belongs at Phillips Academy, and everyone we admit can find success here. \n Admissions decisions, or decisions about hiring faculty members even, do not evolve from a single calculation. Sometimes I fear that we get it wrong: we talk in terms of absolutes, each of which is equally untrue. A Post-Graduate is here to play a sport. A Lower is here because her father went here. A Junior is here because he plays the oboe. An Upper is here because he had a perfect score on the SSAT and never received a grade below A. A Senior is here because she is Latina. This is nonsense. No Admissions Officer, no Dean of Faculty thinks in such reductive and simplistic means — not here and not at any college I know of.\n Let me use myself as an example. When I applied to college, did it help that many people with my last name (and my same first name and middle name, for that matter, dating back centuries) went to a certain college? Did it help my cause that I was the great-great-grandson of a president of the United States, who went to that same college? Did it help that there is a building with my family’s name on it on that same campus? Of course it did. Did it help that I was an athlete, who played a sport that is a competitive one at that same college? I certainly wasn’t at the top of the coach’s list, but I’m equally sure it didn’t hurt my chances. So, you could look now at me and say: you did not deserve your spot at that college. John Palfrey, you took “my” spot at that college. You might say that, but I think that would be both dangerous and wrong. Do you know what my recommendations said? Do you know what my test scores and grades were? Do you know how my interview went? Do you know what the Admissions Officer thought about my essay, about who am I, what my potential is? Do you know whether the faculty thought I would be a person of great integrity and leadership? Of course you don’t. Even I don’t. There’s no one reason why any of us is admitted to any school we get into. There are many factors. Legacy, athletics, race — these are all factors considered by colleges, yes. And there are many more. \n I don’t kid myself about the privileges I have enjoyed. At the same time, I am proud of the family I come from, and I love my family; I am proud to be an athlete and proud of all the sweat and tears and learning that had to go into that; and I am proud of the hard work I have put in to my studies and music and everything else I have struggled at, just as you do. Every single person here should be encouraged to take pride in where they came from, what they have done, who they are and what their potential is.\n Frankly, I think this is the easy part. I know I speak for the faculty when I affirm that everyone who is here with us deserves to be here with us at Andover. We believe in the value of having an intentionally diverse community where we choose to admit you based on our view of your potential, based on very many factors, all of which speak to your potential in the future and the kind of community we seek to create here. These ideas are central to our purpose as a school.\n Now, for the harder part. How can we get better at being an intentionally diverse community? How can we get better, here and now, at Andover? This is much trickier because we need a way to talk to one another that does not divide us, but rather brings us together.\n Think of this school community at a crossroads. There’s a flare up of discussion about race and about difference. We can let it go in one of two directions. We can let it get the better of us and divide us. We can each go back to our camps. We can point our way back toward a community that is segregated and that feeds on mistrust and anger. \n Or we can choose a different path. We can choose a path that is grounded in a belief in inclusivity and respect. We can listen to one another. We can learn about one another’s backgrounds. We can find common ground across differences. \n We can and must take the time to learn about the pressures that many Asian students here face to perform in certain ways. We can and must take the time to understand the deep and enduring cultural hurt associated with blackface and why a cartoon in a newspaper would be sure to upset many members of a community here in the United States in 2014. We can and must take the time to learn about what it is like to be here, no matter our background.\n In fact, this ability to talk to one another, to live with one another, despite our differences is one of the most important skills you ought to learn at Andover. It is a form of excellence that I aspire for each and every one of our graduates to master. This is one of the very many reasons why, with total conviction, I can say to you that there is no tension between excellence in academics, athletics and the arts and having the diverse community that we have here. These ideas are completely in synch with one another. In fact, I would put it in a stronger form: we cannot pursue excellence if we do not have an intentionally diverse community in which we are educating one another. This competency is central to what we are trying to accomplish as a community, and I believe that this competency in diversity is essential to our succeeding, as humankind, in an increasingly global, interconnected world.\n Before I close and urge you all out into the sunshine of this finally-spring day, I want to respond to a few direct questions I’ve been asked in recent days. I share my views not because I know them to be right or to ask you to agree with me, but out of respect for the conversation and out of respect for all of you as students.\n One is whether I support affirmative action. The answer is yes, I do. I believe that affirmative action is essential to the creation of a world that can grapple with the problems that we face, now and into the future. I believe that the long-running support for affirmative action in admissions, upheld consistently by the Supreme Court, though much under fire all that time, is right and good.\n Another question is whether I support the right to free expression and open, honest dialogue on campus. The answer is yes, I do. I believe in the First Amendment to our Constitution in this country. It provides an important framework for the protection of free expression, of dissent and of progress in a democracy. We need diversity of thought at Andover; we need freedom of expression at Andover. \n At the same time, it is important to note what the First Amendment does and does not do. The First Amendment does provide some of the broadest and deepest protections for speech in the world. But it does not afford anyone the right to say anything at any time. The First Amendment is much more complex than that. Even in this free country, there are what are called “time, place and manner” restrictions on what you can say and do. You may dissent, but you cannot shout fire in this chapel right now if there is no fire. Here at Andover, you cannot practice hate in ways that harm others; you cannot lie about others and do them harm; you cannot publish or look at certain obscene things. I believe in a form of free expression that has sharp and appropriate limits. Our job here, on this community, is to define those limits in a way that enables us to be a respectful, inclusive, welcoming place for every single person who is here.\n A final note: I’ve been challenged about the email that Paul Murphy, Linda Carter Griffith and I sent over the weekend, asking you to refrain from taking up these issues further in social media. ‘How,’ I’ve been asked, ‘can you square that message with your message here that we need to talk about these things and to work them out? How, Mr. Palfrey, can you say that, when you love social media and you, yourself, Tweet all the time?’ There are two reasons. The first is because I don’t think that social media is a great forum for the discussion of something as sensitive, personal and nuanced as this; we need classrooms, dorm rooms, dining halls and art spaces to do it; we need teachers and students working together, with a common sense of purpose. \n The second reason is that I want to protect you from yourselves. Some of you have written things online that you may come to regret. When it comes to social media, all of us — whether or not we are teenagers — tend to post first and think second. It’s a proven fact. The problem with this approach is that you may hurt others and hurt yourselves. I worry that you will be putting on digital tattoos — in the form of your words or images — that someday you will wish to rub off, but will not be able to do. If you find yourself in an interview for graduate school or for a job, and you are asked about a posting about other people you typed one day in haste and in anger, how will you feel then? You will almost certainly regret it. \n I have a simple rule: before you post something online, think about whether you’d be O.K. with that statement appearing on the front page of the ‘New York Times’ tomorrow or any day into eternity. If not, then don’t post it. I am urging you to keep this particular conversation out of social media for our collective good and your own good.\n We all came to Andover to live, learn and work together as an intentionally diverse community. We are not perfect; no one of us is perfect. We are all a work in progress, individually and collectively. I am so glad that each and every one of you is here, with us, right now, and I am so glad that we have the great privilege, together, to sort these matters out. I believe in our ability to do this, Andover. \n All-School Meeting dismissed.”\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nWhen Linda Spence became the newest addition to the Oliver Wendell Holmes (OWHL) staff on April 22, she was actually returning to a familiar place. While three of her children attended Andover, Spence served in the Theater Department box office and as an OWHL librarian from 2001 to 2003.\nAfter leaving Andover, Spence pursued a Master’s in Library Science at Simmons College and became an English teacher and a librarian at the Pike School, where she continues to teach.\n“I have wanted to be a librarian since I was very young. As a child, I organized my books and created library cards so that my younger siblings could borrow them,” said Spence in an email to _The Phillipian_.\nNow, as an Andover librarian, Spence hopes to not just help students find information, but also to push students to ask more questions in order to teach them how they can research in the future.\n“[The Internet] is a double-edged sword. Some things are fabulous, and we have access to so many more things than we used to, quickly. You don’t have to do inter-library loans; you can just get it online,” said Spence.\n“But at the same time, there’s that old analogy that getting information now is like drinking from a fire hose. It’s too much, so that skill of weeding through it and making savvy choices about what to spend your time looking at becomes all the more important. Just even knowing where your sources are coming from,” she continued.\nComing into the position, she was most excited about the challenge. “Right now I work with pre-K to ninth grade; it’s just a continuum… because I work with younger kids most of the day as a librarian and teacher at Pike, the thoughts, the questions and the theses [students at Andover] come up with are on a whole different level.”\nAccording to Spence, her extensive experience with a wide age-range of students has given her an insight into where kids are coming from and what skills they will need to be here and to succeed later on. Now, working at Andover, she enjoys the sense of humor that high school students have and simply loves all the information that flows around her and always being able to learn new things.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nFollowing Borden Gym’s successful transition to a BlueCard access system, academic buildings, administrative buildings and dorms will move to a similar system in the next 15 months. \n “We want to bring security and locking at Andover into the 21st century. We want to eventually do away with keys so your cards will be the main point of entry for after-hours. With cards, we’ll be comparable to some of the other educational institutions that are around and have card access,” said Thomas Conlon, Director of Public Safety.\n Installation will begin this summer, according to Conlon. Academic buildings will transition first, and dorms and administrative buildings will be changed through a 15-month period. The card-access system will be used for academic and administrative buildings outside of the hours of 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., according to Conlon. \n In addition to heightening campus security by preventing people outside of the Andover community from accessing campus buildings, the BlueCard-access system will help with emergency lockdowns.\n “With cards we have the ability, in an emergency and if we have to do an emergency lockdown, to do an emergency lockdown of all the buildings electronically and not depend on people going to the doors and mechanically trying to lock exterior doors,” said Conlon.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\n **The Phillipian** : _What is the role of the faculty, students and the administration in regards to this conversation of race? Whose responsibility is this?_\n**Mr. Palfrey** : “I think this is the kind of topic where yes, you have to be deliberate and say right now we are talking about race or we are talking about gender or we are talking about whatever the discipline. I think it’s also something, though, that is most effectively done when it is a common cultural commitment: a commitment that we make as a community.\nI think we should all be teaching one another. Everyone should be approaching this, underrepresented minority or not, and should start with good will. I think the idea that presuming the person across from you may be different but is also human and can relate on some level and try to find that common ground. I think it’s important, as I mentioned before, not to put all the burden of the race conversation on someone who comes from an underrepresented minority background. They certainly have, in the conversation, a point of view that is going to be different and is valid for lots of good reasons. I think it’s really just a shared commitment as opposed to your role as this and my role as that, and is something that each of us should come at it with a sense of equity.”\n**The Phillipian** : _How can we, as a campus, work to make sure students of every race feel safe here? How can the school and its students educate each other to promote a culture of inclusivity?_\n**Mr. Palfrey** : “That’s a wonderful question, and put really well, because I think the hallmark of Andover has always been one that has strived toward equity and inclusivity more than our peers in some respects. It’s been something that from the founding of the school has been an aspiration. Now, we’ve not gotten it right always, and we still don’t get it entirely right, but we’re working on it. So I think for one thing to call it out as something good, that we perceive as important institutionally–and by institutionally I mean the school thinks this–but also individually, that we all do and we all take this on as a shared endeavor.\nI think a second thing would be [that] I am interested in what mean when we talk about ‘excellence’ here at Andover. I think that one of the things we are finding is that cultural competency, the ability to relate across various forms of difference, is in fact a form of excellence that we value. Why do we have an intentionally diverse community? In part because we value that. We value the fact that people come from different places and bring different strengths and are not easily defined by their GPA or not defined well by test scores or not defined well by how far you throw the javelin or how well you play the violin. I am intrigued by the idea of a common discussion of how we redefine excellence, and how we build cultural literacy and cultural competency into that. When you then get out into wherever else you are, in a college or job or graduate degree program, in any of these environments you are going to have to work in a team, particularly in a global environment where people come from lots of different places. So I think that there are lots of reasons why this is important, and I think we have to make this a part of what we think it means to be a successful student at Andover.”\n**The Phillipian** : _What would you say right now to a student on campus who is afraid of participating in this discussion of race?_\n**Mr. Palfrey** : “I would say it’s totally understandable to be afraid to participate, but it is a mistake. I think the idea of stepping back when we have these differences is an instinct that I can understand, but something I think we need to resist. Stepping forward into it, I think, is again making a common commitment to addressing issues that are in front of us. I don’t think anybody on this campus could say race is not an issue at [Andover] right now. And if that’s so, it’s much better to confront it than to run the other way. I think the challenge, for sure, is if it’s not something that you’ve been doing all your life and having conversations about race, if it’s not been something you’ve been doing at the dinner table or that you’ve thought that much about, there is an extra onus on you to seek out people in the community who are comfortable with talking about it and who are able to help you become literate in that particular way. Again, that’s where I go back to this idea of excellence including cultural competency, and I know there are lots of people on this campus for sure who are open to being helpful in that respect. I feel like even if you’re not comfortable at this moment, you might say, ‘Over the course of four years here, this is something that I want to develop, and I can do that through course selection, mentorship, how I choose my friends and where I sit in Paresky on a daily basis.’ I think that’s an unbelievable skill, no matter what background you’re coming from, to be able to emerge from high school with.”\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nAndover will employ the National Association of Independent School’s (NAIS) Assessment of Inclusivity and Multiculturalism (AIM) tool to evaluate inclusivity and multiculturalism in the coming year, according to Linda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development. \n To begin, a 20-minute survey that will be sent out to students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and trustees on May 16. \n “This survey is going to help us by giving us quantitative data. I think we have a lot of qualitative data from conversations and from how we live, but it’s going to help us better plan what we need to do to ensure that we have an inclusive community that engages people in a respectful level, where people can be themselves. This will give us tangible results from which we can base future planning towards a sustained, inclusive school community,” said Griffith. \n The Campus-Wide Climate Survey will include questions relating to comfort and inclusion on campus. Results from the survey will be confidential, and the survey itself will be administered by an external vendor. Griffith said the timing of the AIM is pivotal with regards to the strategic planning process. \n “As we look at what it means to have core values such as equity and inclusivity, we need to know where we stand, what the climate currently is, in order for us to determine what education-awareness tools we need to bring. What, when, where and why, and we’re going to get the why from the results, and then it’ll be what, when and where, and whether that can happen in dormitories and classrooms,” said Griffith. \n In fall 2014, focus groups called Discovery Committees will hone in on topics such as school governance, student life, faculty life, teaching, learning and athletics. \n Steering committee members and trained faculty facilitators will write a full self-assessment of the school, which will guide the planning of diversity initiatives to ensure progress where the survey indicates is needed. \n Griffith began planning this process last year with the AIM Steering Committee.

Leah Shrestinian ’14, the third finalist, did not present on Wednesday because of an Advanced Placement exam.\nFounded in 1867 by William G. Means, the Means Essay Prize is awarded to an outstanding student-written essay from the school year, according to the prize description. To support the events that mark the 40th year of coeducation at Andover, all essays submitted to the competition had to discuss gender.\nElias Rodriques, Christopher Wade and Elizabeth Davis, Teaching Fellows in English, judged the competition and will select this year’s winner.\n* * *\n**Alyssa Augustin**\nIn her essay, Augustin recounted an incident at a public women’s restroom in the food court of a mall, where other women in the bathroom mistook her for a man and were unsure of how to react to her presence.\n“‘This is the ladies’ room.’ A beat passes… my response, ‘I am a lady, thank you,’ is overridden by an amendment to a previous statement. ‘Oh,’ she says and, just barely, ‘Sorry,’” said Augustin in her essay.\n“At this point, everybody is staring at you and furtively pretending they are not. Every grown woman who is not in the stall is examining my face, raking my body up and down with their eyes, trying to rationalize my presence among them,” she continued in her story at ASM.\nAugustin’s essay came to her when she saw that the prompt for the Means Essay changed to require the topic of gender in each submitted essay, even though starting was the hardest part for her.\n“Listening to people talking about it really inspired me to write it. The way I see it, it wasn’t a restriction, but an idea,” she said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“I hope [students] stop thinking about gender in the binary or conversations here in the binary or because they think that there are no [transgender] people here, that it doesn’t matter if they include [transgender] perspectives or anything about [transgender] people in conversations about gender,” continued Augustin.\n* * *\n**Joey Salvo**\nIn his essay titled “Old Answer,” Salvo described the societal pressures he faced during his nine-year career in ballet, beginning in Kindergarten as the only boy in a class of 12.\nSalvo recounted the day he was waiting in line with his parents and an elderly man in a wheelchair rolled behind them in the line. The man carefully eyed Salvo and accusingly said, “And what are you going to be, eh? A football player?” Salvo responded by saying, “No, a dancer.”\n“It was like opening a door only to find an ocean on the other side. The man recoiled as quickly as his ancient spine would allow and looked to my parents. ‘What?!’ he barked. Perhaps his hearing aid had just inconveniently short-circuited. Without flinching, my mother looked him in the eye and shouted back, ‘A dancer.’ The man closed his mouth, and a darkness as absolute as a theatre just after the curtain rises flickered past his eyes. A dancer. A male dancer,” said Salvo at ASM.\nAs a child, Salvo felt male dancers were never held in the same esteem as their female counterparts. When the New York City Ballet came to visit his ballet school, Salvo remembered his fascination with one particular ballerina.\n“It was the ballerina, always the ballerina. She leaned and twisted and leaped, and all the while her partner fulfilled his role as her private scaffolding. No matter. No one ever dreams about becoming a ballerina or a ballo or whatever you call a male ballet dancer, right? Somehow I never encountered an accurate term for it in nine years of ballet training,” said Salvo.\n“Most [of the girls] wanted to be fairy princesses. All I wanted was to answer music the way it had answered me,” he continued.\nHaving been mesmerized by the annual readings of the Means Essay Prize, Salvo always wanted to write for it.\n“I sat [in ASM] and I saw these Seniors read these beautiful essays, and I hadn’t really been in the writing community that much yet, so it was nice to know that there were people here who could write like that and those who could then say it in this strong, courageous manner. This year, I thought, ‘I have to do it,’” said Salvo.\n* * *\n**Leah Shrestinian**\nIn her essay, “Not Finished Yet,” Shrestinian detailed her bad experience with her first kiss.\n“I was supposed to have my first kiss in the sixth grade, like all of my friends. Or in the seventh grade. Seventh grade would have been respectable. Only, no one seemed to want to kiss me. The only guys who did were the ones in my seventh grade French class… but I wanted a football player. A skier. A slacker…. someone cool so I could proudly tell my friends: ‘He wanted me.’,” wrote Shrestinian.\nThroughout her the essay, Shrestinian described her encounter with Chris, a pseudonym for the so-called “cool” person she did kiss, and how uncomfortable and confused she felt at the time.\n“ I spent… ten minutes trying to decide if my tongue was in the right place and wondering if I could somehow make it retreat down my throat to make room for his because I wasn’t sure my mouth was quite big enough for whatever was going on. Was it supposed to be this repetitive? And, well, wet? I kept thinking about Harry Potter, somewhat proudly, because the term ‘snogging’ finally made sense to me,” wrote Shrestinian.\nShrestinian wrote this essay to add to a collection of essays for her English class with Seth Bardo, Instructor in English. She created the essays based on lines taken from her old journal.\n“It was kind of a sexist moment, which is why I wrote about it. I was sitting on a rock, and I was kind of uncomfortable, so I moved and he was like, ‘I’m not finished yet.’ So I think it was difficult because when you have those moments you feel like it is your fault.”\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nIn the sudden, life-or-death situation of cardiac arrest, most people do not know what to do. Panic and hysteria set in immediately, and the window of saving the victim’s life flashes by. CPR training needed to successfully save a victim, however, is easy, valuable and useful for any member of the public to possess.\n Wendy Cogswell, Community Relations Officer, has been recently trying to equip the community with necessary tools. Working with Sam Zager ’15, Cogswell is offering several free classes on campus throughout the spring and summer to allow the Andover community to become certified in Automated External Defibrillator – Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (AED-CPR).\n For Zager, being CPR-certified has a much greater significance in his own personal life. \n “When my brother was 17, a good friend of his and he were horsing around after school. His friend gave him a friendly punch to the heart, nothing too hard, but by a crazy fluke, my brother’s heart stopped from a condition called commotio cordis. It is the leading cause of death among young athletes. He dropped to the ground, and his friend didn’t know how to perform CPR. There was no AED nearby, and by the time my brother got to the hospital, he was gone,” said Zager. \n Zager continued, “Had his friend been able to perform CPR or use an AED (automated external defibrillator), my brother might still be alive today. I don’t want anyone else to have to deal with that, especially because it can be so easily prevented.”\n Empowered by this tragic experience in his own life, Zager is now motivated to help more people learn these simple yet necessary skills that may one day save another person’s life. For him, the practice of CPR is the ultimate example of “non sibi,” and there is no better place to help educate people on the topic.\n Zager worked with Maureen Ferris, Director of Student Risk Management, and Thomas Conlon, Director of Public Safety, throughout the fall and winter. Ferris and Conlon funded the purchasing of more AEDs to be placed around campus. He then approached Cogswell in January of this year, and the two of them produced the concept of free CPR-certification classes. \n After establishing the program, Zager worked with Christopher Capano, Director of Student Activities, to post advertisements on PAnet urging students to contact him if they were interested in the course. It was overwhelming success — within two weeks four classes were completely full and a waiting list had to be created.\n “It doesn’t take that much time to become CPR certified and it is an important life skill. I am so grateful that [Zager] and [Cogswell] gave me the opportunity to take the course and become certified. I strongly hope more classes like the one I took will become available so other students can learn how to save someone’s life if need be,” said Hannah Sorkin ’14, a participant in the CPR/AED course.\n On Cogswell’s part, she volunteered her own free time to teach the classes. Her motivation stems from pure humanitarianism, as her reward is seeing more people empowered to provide life-saving care. She has provided CPR a number of times and describes it as a wonderful experience. Every time she performs CPR, she becomes more and more confident in her abilities to help provide emergency care to save a life.\n Zager and Cogswell said they are extremely pleased by the overwhelming show of enthusiasm and support for the certification classes by the general Andover community, and also the amount of eager participants. They hope to extend the program to the fall of next year and possibly beyond, so more members of the Andover community can learn the skill.\n Requiring only two hours for certification, the class is held in the Abbot Hall School Room and in the Elson Art Center. The very first class for this program was held on Sunday, April 27, although classes will be held on Thursdays in the future. Classes are open to both teachers and students, although they are separated between the two, so that each class does not exceed six people.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nAndover’s endowment draw will be reduced to below 5 percent within the year, even lower than its original 5.65 percent projection, said Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer. Over the past several years, the draw has remained fairly constant. In fiscal year 2011, the draw was 5.68 percent. In 2012, the draw rose to 5.83 percent, and in 2013, the draw settled to 5.73 percent. The draw is the amount taken from the endowment to fund operating expenses divided by the endowment value at the beginning of the fiscal year. Andover’s endowment draw is expected to fall below 5 percent this year as a result of restructuring the school’s debt. A major part of this restructuring involved issuing 30-year bonds. “We’ve issued some bonds, tax-exempt and taxable bonds to the public…and we’re going to use that money, which was approximately $50 million, to pay for capital projects,” said Carter. As a result of the bonds, Andover hopes to complete several capital projects over the next couple of years, including installing card-access systems in academic buildings, dormitories and administrative buildings and replacing the running track, according to an email sent to The Phillipian by Elizabeth Davis, Associate Director of Facilities. Other projects slated to occur include an interior renovation to Samuel Phillips Hall, which entails “upgrades to HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), electrical, lighting and technology systems,” and an athletics master plan, which involves an analysis of the needs of the athletic department and the creation of a “conceptual plan that addresses these needs,” said Davis. To illustrate how the bonds help pay for capital projects, Carter described the renewal of Bishop Hall. “The bonds paid for the renewal retroactively. Once we issued the bonds, we were actually able to submit the receipts from the project and get the money back,” said Carter. The school benefits as long as the endowment earns more than the interest rate on the bonds. “Say the endowment is earning 8 percent, and we’re paying 4.8 percent [interest on the bonds], we’re actually earning 3.2 percent,” said Carter. Both the tax-exempt and taxable bonds have a fixed interest rate, meaning that the interest rate on the bonds does not change. For the tax-exempt bonds, the interest rate is 4.7 percent, and for the taxable bonds, the interest rate is 4.9 percent, according to Carter. Despite the fact that the draw should be below 5 percent by the end of the year, it will be several years before the draw is below 5 percent without the aid of the bonds. “If we maintain financial discipline, we could be below 5 percent in about four or five years,” said Carter. Andover’s endowment draw is currently higher than that of its peer schools, whose draws are typically below 5 percent. Carter said that Andover’s struggles to lower the endowment draw, however, are not an indication of a struggle to afford need-blind admissions. “There are lots of different priorities in the budget that cost money in addition to need-blind,” said Carter. “There’s also faculty salaries, which are a big component of the budget. There are faculty and staff benefits. There’s renewal of the facilities. There’s energy cost. There’s food at Paresky Commons.There’s all that stuff that goes into making up the budget, and financial aid is just one component of the budget.” Carter said that Andover has maintained a steady draw rate since before the introduction of need-blind admissions. Carter said that Andover has more “aspirations” than its peer schools, which also makes the draw higher. “We have outreach programs that we run. We have higher salaries than other schools. We are trying to do a better job of keeping up the facilities than other schools.…We’ve been trying to do a lot of stuff at the same time, and I think that’s what causes us to fall behind.” Andover currently has two “tranches” of bonds, according to Carter. “We have $60 million of bonds that we issued in 2003.…Then we have [$81 million of] bonds that we issued just this past February,” said Carter. The bonds do not have to be repaid until 2025, which is when the first payments are due on the bonds that were sold in 2003. “We start paying back the bonds in 2025. 2003 bonds start to be paid back in 2025 to 2034. Then, in 2035, we start to pay back the 2014 bonds, the ones we just did, and those go from 2035-2044,” said Carter.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nSitting at the Circulation Desk looking over the entire lobby of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL), Stephanie Scenna kicked off her first week as the newest member of the OWHL staff with an friendly, enthusiastic smile.\n As the evening proctor and one of the Sunday circulation staff, Scenna will help maintain a quiet, productive environment at the library as well as helping students with the research process.\n Although she has had no prior experience working in a library, she has spent hours and hours in her school library during her undergraduate and graduate study days. “I commuted to school, so the library was always my go-to spot between classes, and I logged plenty of hours during my college education,” she said.\n Looking beyond her primary duties as a circulation assistant, Scenna aspires to be a mentor figure for students who can relate to what they’re going through but also give guidance and support.\n “I look forward to helping students out in whichever way I can at the OWHL. So far it’s come in handy with a book recommendation, but I’m sure as time goes on things will come up where I would be able to fall back on my researching days to point someone in the right direction.”\n Scenna majored in Criminal Justice as an undergraduate at Northeastern University and continued her education at Tufts University, where she received her Master’s Degrees in Public Administration and Criminal Justice. At Tufts, she was also an intern for eight months doing work relating to criminal justice and human resources.\n When she was given an opportunity to work at Northeastern in employment, however, she realized that her true passion primarily lay in working in human resources. The role of the human-resources department in any organization is to serve employees and customers, helping them potentially find a job within a company, according to Scenna.\n Working as a human-resources professional, Scenna learned how to treat customers and listen to what their issues were and help come up with a solution. Now she looks to draw from her previous experiences to assist Andover students with their research in particular.\n “It feels wonderful to help a student out when they come to me for help, even if it’s simply recommending a book to a student for his or her research paper,” she continued.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nThe Phillipian_ sat down with Linda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, who shared her advice on how to engage in meaningful, constructive and respectful dialogue about race._\n“The best way to talk about race is, I agree with Mr. Palfrey, in person. We can’t always talk about race in person and I get that, but we are a community. We are here, we live here: we are a residential community. I think we have to find safe spaces, create spaces, and we have to — many people don’t like the word ‘train’ — but we have to equip adults and students to be able to have a safe and respectful dialogue.”\n**Guidelines for Conversation**\n“One guideline is always using ‘I statements.’ Another thing that is really important is for people to understand the difference between intent and impact. That is huge in diversity training because someone’s intent may have been to set the record straight or to give his or her viewpoint, but understanding the impact is something I practice a lot in conversation. Another skill that is very effective is called ‘and/or both’ thinking, as opposed to ‘you think this, but this is the way it is.’ If you just change one word to ‘I see it this way, and you see it that way,’ there is a very, very slight difference, but you can hear it. I’ll give you an example: ‘That is a great dress, but it’s green,’ what’s the implication about the green? That it is problematic. When you change ‘but’ to an ‘and,’ there isn’t a bias that goes into the expression.”\n**Building Vocabulary**\n“I think what’s important is that students know it’s okay not to be skilled and versed at this when they enter Andover. So, how are we going to ensure that they have language? One is the start of the glossary, which I’m really excited about. You have to start with having some vocabulary and language, creating safe spaces with ‘I statements’ and with ‘and/or’ dialogue thinking and thinking about intent and impact.This also means you agree to disagree in a very respectful way.”\n**The Three “H”s: Head, Heart and Hand**\n“The other thing you need is to be equipped with some awareness, and I’d like to call it cultural competence. As long as we reduce race into something intellectual, we’re in trouble, and that is the critical issue here at Andover. Yes, you can be a CAMD Scholar, you can take a course on race or on the civil rights or gender issues or intersectionality, so it can definitely be academic. [But] race is beyond that. Race is our lived experiences. So if you want to take that from me and give me a stat or data or reduce it to intellectual dialogue, you just invalidated my life experience.\nWhenever we do work in real diversity training, I use the three ‘H’s: you have to get it in your head, you have to have some empathy in your heart and you must change your action with your hand. So if people keep intellectualizing it, nothing is going to happen. It’s very similar to our motto that went up on the board on [Wednesday at ASM]: goodness without knowledge is feeble. We have goodness without knowledge and knowledge without goodness, but we need both. It’s got to be both. We need it on the intellectual level, and we need to have it at the heart level. If you reduce the feeling part, you have this intellectual argument, where we argue numbers and stats that prove and invalidate. What happened here is that we took a conversation that could have been about affirmative action and turned it into something that felt personalized because the school has a core value of intentional diversity. Race is a core part of our identity that we can not change. We need to stop reducing this to intellectual discourse and we need to understand it is about feeling.”\n**Inclusivity**\n“When there’s a conversation about race, it’s cannot be reduced to black and white or black and Asian. It’s everybody, so that’s another difficulty that we get into when we say we’re going to have a conversation about race. That was one of the best parts about working with the ‘Out of the Blue’ (OOTB) team. The OOTB white students had to engage with race, and they had to be told, “You have a race and we want to hear about your race. We want you to speak about it and get to understand your race and racial history, your racialized history.” I think that’s a really big point in conversations about race, just like conversations about class. If we’re having a conversation about class, I want to talk about the upper class, elite class, middle class, low-income, working and poor. I don’t want the conversation to be just about poor people. It is far more complicated.”\n**Overcoming Fear**\n“The fear of making mistakes, of saying the wrong thing, of not knowing in a community that values intellect more than anything and intelligence is the other point I want to raise. Why would I engage in a conversation with you about something I know little about? Because this community values intellectualism, and I don’t have it in that area. Kids come to Andover and it’s not on their mind; it’s ‘let’s get that ‘6,’’ ‘let me get that 800 on the SAT.’ They don’t have to think about race, but when you’re an underrepresented person, you typically do. When you feel different in any way, you typically do. The only reason we are having the level of discourse we’re having right now on race and gender is because a lot of kids went out and educated themselves, and it is because social media has allowed increased access. People need to read some of the information in ‘Out of the Blue,’ outside of the stories, and I hope that gives you enough context about some ways to begin to have conversations.”\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nLinda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), is working with alumni, students and faculty of color to launch an alumni program for the newly formed Sisterhood affinity group on campus. \n Sisterhood is an affinity group designed to support and mentor underrepresented women on campus. “We as a group are learning and coming to a better understanding of the intersectionality of race and gender in our lives,” wrote Griffith in an email to The Phillipian.\n “Our goals are to provide mentorship and create solidarity through programming to connect students to [Andover] alumnae and faculty of color on campus,” she continued. \n This past Winter Term, Griffith organized a “Sister Supper” for all the African-American and Latina girls on campus. The girls talked about a variety of topics, mostly pertaining to race, gender and the intersectionality of the two subjects.\n After a surprisingly large turnout of nearly 50 students, Griffith asked the girls if they wanted to meet again to discuss the issues brought up by their peers, Camille Little ’16, a member of the Sisterhood, said. \n Upon hearing positive feedback from the girls at the dinner, Griffith worked with several students, including Kai Kornegay ’14, Kayla Thompson ’15, Alex Thomas ’15 and Charlie Jarvis ’15, and started the Sisterhood on campus to provide further support for the girls who came to the meeting.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nOver 4,000 people streamed into Andover’s Cochran Bird Sanctuary as they participated in the Step Up for Colleen 5K Benefit Run/Walk fundraiser last Sunday. A group of Andover students, faculty and staff joined in on the fundraising effort, including Belinda Traub, Administrative Assistant in the Head of School Office, and Stephanie Donovan, Benefits Specialist and Wellness Program Coordinator. The event was in honor of Colleen Ritzer, a former resident in the town of Andover and math teacher at Danvers High School who was tragically killed last October. A group of Ritzer’s family and friends, who organized the race, contacted Public Safety to see if they could use Andover’s campus as part of the race route, according to Thomas Conlon, Director of Public Safety. “I believe the values of this school related to part of the run/walk taking place on campus. Given the fact that she was a teacher, a local girl from Andover, a local young lady and just that the event was such a tragic event, I thought it was very gracious of [the Senior Administrative Council] to be able to say yes to provide a place for this event,” said Conlon. Money raised from the run/walk will go towards the Colleen Ritzer Memorial Scholarship Fund, which was established by Ritzer’s family to support Seniors attending Andover High School or Danvers High School.\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nBuilding off of their existing blog, “Out of the Blue” (OOTB) will launch a revamped website.\n “We’ve decided to revamp it as a more appropriate forum for online dialogue. Originally it was just 2-3 OOTB core team members running it and posting links to articles etc, but now we’re having each online section from the book (gender, religion, class, etc.) run by an editor,” said Devonae Freeland ’15, Co-Editor in Chief of the website and OOTB coordinator. The new website will also include a pdf of the OOTB book, underclassmen opinions and online resources regarding race on campus. OOTB’s new website, andover.edu/outoftheblue, will launch this week.\n The original blog arose as a way of continuing the dialogue started in the print edition of OOTB, said Isabella Berkley ’15, Co-Editor in Chief of the OOTB website and OOTB coordinator. Berkley and Freeland want the blog to be a place that fosters dialogue on both issues internal and external to Andover, as well as a place where students can always voice their opinions.\n “The blog is really a space to continuously be sharing stories, to be responding to and sharing opinion pieces about things that are going on on campus, about things that are going on in the larger world sense,” said Berkley.\n Along with wanting to continue the dialogue started in the book, the OOTB coordinators hope that the blog elevates the level of discourse on campus in a way that cannot occur on social media.\n “We made a conscious decision not to just have a Facebook page… We made that decision because we wanted the book to sort of stand on its own, and be a more monitored space and a safe environment for people… It would be more of a facilitated discussion,” said Berkley.\n Freeland said, “We look at this as an opportunity to get underclassmen involved in the dialogue. We’re reaching out to organizations such as AMP, the Af-Lat-Am mentoring program for new students, to say, ‘If you have something to say or a story to submit, we want that and we want to provide this space for you to do that.’”\n\n', 'May 8, 2014'), ('\nSenior Spring Fever, a new pilot sexual-education program for Seniors, was launched by Amy Patel, Medical Director at Isham; Andrea Orben, Health Educator; Sarah Robinson, Nurse Practitioner; and 19 other volunteer members of the faculty and staff during the first three weeks of Spring Term as a way to enhance the current sexual-health education offerings. \n Inspired by the program that Beth Buyea, Andover Medical Consultant, created as former Medical Director at Northfield Mount Hermon, the 90-minute, non-mandatory seminars revolved around a variety of topics, such as healthy relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and rape. \n “People had questions about even some of the basics. Either we are not getting [the message] effectively across the first time, or they just need some reinforcement, which is actually more likely. Maybe when they learned about STDs when they were 14, it just wasn’t on their minds to even be engaging in intercourse or contracting STDs. But, as students get older, it becomes a little bit more practical information,” said Patel.\n Students at Andover currently have sexual education during their Junior and Lower years in Biology 100, Personal and Community Engagement (PACE) classes and Physical Education (PE) class. Afterwards, however, students don’t have any opportunities to further their understandings on sex, making it necessary for there to be a sexual-education class for Seniors, according to Robinson.\n “If you have PE during Freshman Fall, for instance, all of a sudden it’s Senior Spring and a lot has changed. Someone could have come out during that gap of time, and things that were relevant then are not anymore. So now, given the new situation, that student really needs to think more about the risk factors that they are going to be facing. I think it is important to close the loop,” said Robinson.\n Robinson also acknowledged that current methods of sexual education, like PE classes, were not adequate in addressing the growing needs of Andover students. \n As Seniors make the transition from Andover to college, they are also transitioning to a new health-care provider on campus. Robinson and Patel hope to use this new class to promote self-advocacy in the Seniors for when they meet with physicians and care providers in college and beyond.\n Additionally, with the recent reliance students have on the Internet, Robinson said that the program hopes to eliminate the potential for students to gather false information.\n “The nice thing about [these classes] is the access to medical providers teaching these classes and having really easy-going, friendly conversations. I never felt like I had so much access as a teenager to a doctor or a nurse practitioner who was available to talk about these things,” Robinson said.\n “We know that there is more to do. We think that we need several more hours every year over four years to have the comprehensive, age-appropriate, inclusive health education program or sex-education program that we are striving for,” Patel said.\n Patel acknowledges the need to include day students, who do not benefit from dorm talks about sex and reproductive health, in the sexual-education program.\n “We want to make sure that the stuff that is covered in regards to reproductive health care topics in that setting can be reproduced in another place for the day students who wouldn’t get that in a dorm meeting….We certainly want to make sure that day student advisors can talk to their advisees about health issues, but the more specific stuff may be coming better from health-care providers or health educators at Isham,” said Patel. \n Patel and Robinson admit that the turnout of students was not as great as they had originally hoped, as Robinson’s class had only eight students. They plan to continue the program next spring, however. One of the areas for improvement in the Senior classes will be generating a meeting time that would fit into the schedules of the largest number of Seniors possible.\n “We’re trialing new ways of disseminating health information. We have some forums set up already, such as Wellness Week, PACE and the dorm conversations that happen. We don’t feel like we need to do this all in the classroom. We don’t need to do this in a seminar format with 15 or 20 people that you don’t know very well,” said Patel.\n Patel and Robinson hope that there will be classes of a similar size and nature to the Senior Spring Fever classes for Juniors, Lowers and Uppers in the coming month.\n\n', 'May 1, 2014'), ('\nIt happens behind closed doors. Students binge and purge, “food-journal” and skip meals. Eating disorders manifest across all campuses, but their prevalence and repercussions are rarely discussed.\n Issues of body image and eating disorders affect high schools across the country. According to The Phillipian’s 2013 State of the Academy survey, nearly 15 percent of Andover students — including 21 percent of females and 7 percent of males — have had an eating disorder, and 60 percent of the students here know of someone who has suffered from one. \n The prevalence of eating disorders on Andover’s campus is 4 percent higher than that of the average high school, according to the National Association for Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. In addition to anorexia nervosa and bulimia, many students are diagnosed with EDNOS, or Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified, according to Agatha Kip, Nutrition Counselor.\n “[Eating disorders are] often associated with highly competitive people. And, you know, in our culture here, thinness is ‘in,’ being overweight is frowned upon and being fat is really looked [upon] as the ‘worst thing’ possible…. So when you put lots of competitive people in one setting, you tend to find more eating disorders,” said Max Alovisetti, Director of Graham House.\n Students can self-report an eating disorder, or Isham may approach students after concerned friends or faculty members suspect they may have an eating disorder, according to Kip. Isham, Graham House and Kip help students suffering with eating disorders by treating the mental, physical and nutritional aspects of their illness.\n Students suffering from an eating disorder meet periodically with their entire “team,” including Kip, a Graham House counselor and Isham representative, often Sarah Robinson, Nurse Practitioner, or Amy Patel, Medical Director.\n “I think there is misinformation about being kicked out of school for having anything health-wise going on with them. Often one of the first things that I will say to someone is, ‘I just want you to know that you are not going to be kicked out of school,’ and you can see the relief,” said Patel. \n “[Taking medical leave] depends on where the student falls on the spectrum as to if in consultation with the health care providers, the parents, the student, outside doctors, their own doctor, if a student would be best served taking a break from [Andover] so that they can be in a healthier place,” she continued. \n Patel said that Andover students’ Type-A personalities, paired with their independence, could contribute to the prevalence of eating disorders on campus. \n “We are a boarding school. We want people to be independent and making their decisions, and the vast majority of our students don’t have parents watching over them and making sure that they are eating, and so it might take longer to actually get diagnosed because there isn’t somebody who is necessarily seeing that there is a problem,” said Patel. \n Survey results also showed that campus stress can affect the prevalence of unhealthy habits. Seventy-five percent of students believe that campus time commitments negatively impact their health, according to the 2013 State of The Academy survey. \n Laura Ippolito ’14 said, “I think that the pressure here really adds to eating disorders. There are these kids coming in here with straight ‘A’s,’ never getting below an ‘A minus,’ stellar athletes.… It’s all about control, and so I think that students try to grasp onto what they can control in their lives by controlling their bodies.”\n Though eating disorders affect all students, girls on campus are three times as likely to have an eating disorder than their male counterparts. \n Some students might not notice that they have an eating disorder, as instead of having medically defined anorexia or bulimia, they have an EDNOS. \n “A certain number of students ‘flirt’ with an eating disorder. But, if they’re aware of it in time or someone catches it in time, they can stop relatively easily. It’s what happens after people have gone through this for years, which can happen, and they put themselves in increasingly more risk, medically,” said Alovisetti. \n Within much of Andover’s campus, the “stick-thin” body ideal prevails among female students, according to Kip. \n Jaleel Williams ‘15 said, “In my experience, [Andover students] see food as this double-edged sword. We’re both like, ‘Ah, yes, I love food!’ and ‘Ugh, fine, I guess I’ll have that extra slice.’ It’s almost like we’re relenting to a defeat if you decide to eat more food.”\n Eating disorders and body image on campus and across the country are linked to race, class and gender. While 14 percent of white students have had an eating disorder, just over 10 percent of black or Hispanic students have had eating disorders, according to the 2013 State of the Academy survey.\n “In African-American, African and Latino culture, food is viewed very differently. Historically, it was a sign, coming from poverty, that if you had money, you had access, you had food, then you weren’t skinny. As a result, that’s carried on, there’s not as much value in being skinny as in other cultures,” said Linda Griffiths, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD).\n\n', 'May 1, 2014'), ('\nThe spirit of “Non Sibi” has stayed with Biz Ghormley ’00 long after she graduated from Andover, guiding her current work as the Deputy Director of External Affairs and Development of Inwood House, a nonprofit organization that helps teens from New York City escape the cycle of poverty.\n Ghormley returned to campus to urge current Andover students to truly recommit to the meaning of Non Sibi and make an impact on the lives of the less privileged as this year’s Non-Sibi Speaker for All-School Meeting (ASM) this Wednesday. \n “You are some of the smartest and [most] well-positioned people in the world, and you can make change with your creativity, your compassion, your intelligence and most importantly your support for one another and your determination. I hope you allow yourself: ask questions, speak up, listen and let the sun shine on you,” said Ghormley to the student body.\n “Andover has had a huge influence on my work. It opened my eyes to my worldview and challenged me to consider what had created it, gave me access to worlds I would otherwise have not known existed and brought wonderful people into my life. Andover showed me my own capacity, determination, perseverance and dedication to excellence,” she continued.\n Recounting her involvement in Inwood House leading marketing and fundraising initiatives to help teens, Ghormley emphasized the power of storytelling in bringing meaningful change to people’s lives. “Listening, translating and curating stories for different audiences has allowed me to help people be freed — literally — from jail. [It has] helped us build partnerships with companies and donors, helped us elevate the expertise of people who have been shunned and help build a more just world,” wrote Ghormley in an email to The Phillipian.\n “Storytelling for me is not about creating stories, but bringing them forward and presenting them in ways that new audiences can be influenced by the truth of people’s lives,” she continued. \n Ghormley also discussed this idea of worth during ASM, highlighting the importance of expressing compassion and respect to all people. “Our work [at Inwood House] has shown us something I think you all know to be true: teenagers deserve respect. Shaming teenagers will likely lead to defiance and pain, but respecting teenagers, on the flipside, will help them succeed. People of all ages are worthy of respect and compassion, wrong answers or different experiences alike,” said Ghormley. \n “I like to work… based on the simplest idea that we all matter,” she continued. \n In addition to her contribution to the development of Inwood House, Ghormley also worked with Digital Democracy in Haiti and worked bilingually to investigate criminal cases with the Bronx Defenders.\n\n', 'May 1, 2014'), ('\nAt the age of 12, Eugene Hughes first picked up Pat Conroy’s 1972 memoir, “The Water is Wide.” The memoir captured Hughes’ attention and sparked his passion for education and the pursuit of knowledge. \n “[‘The Water is Wide’] is not the greatest book ever, now that I’ve reread it, but the very first few pages talk about [Conroy] sitting down with the guy who was going to hire him, the superintendent, and I think it was at that moment that I realized I wanted to be a teacher of something, and eventually I wanted to be a Ph.D. as well,” said Hughes, Instructor and Interim Chair in French.\n When he is not teaching sections of French 300 and French 420 or fulfilling his role as Interim Chair in French, Hughes, the newly elected head of the World Language Department, is pursuing his love of learning through other avenues.\n For the past five years, Hughes has been working towards his Ph.D. while juggling a full-time job. After defending his 220 page dissertation, Hughes will be awarded a Ph.D. in 16th-century French literature, specifically the works of Hélisenne de Crenne, from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC). Although the actual Ph.D. will not be awarded to him until August, the UNC committee approved his dissertation last week. \n According to Hughes, his unconventional path to a Ph.D. took him all over the globe. \n “I was a teacher at 21 [years old] at a public school,” said Hughes. “I went to France for a few years after undergrad to do a couple other degrees there. Then I came back and taught at a public high school in Charleston, South Carolina for four years, and then I decided to go back to graduate school. I’ve been technically enrolled at UNC for a while, but I’ve been writing [a dissertation] part-time, as I’ve been doing full-time jobs since 2009.”\n Hughes said that while he studied French at Wofford College, his true love of French blossomed during the years when he lived in France. \n “I’m from kind of the Northwest corner of upstate South Carolina in the mountains in a small town. I went [to France] for the first time right before my 21st birthday. It was great to just be in a different culture. My French was shaky when I first got there, so that really got a lot better very quickly. It was really a life-changing experience,” said Hughes.\n Though teaching French is “like getting paid to be a stand-up comedian” for Hughes, he values the intellectual interaction with his students more and brings his personal experience into the classroom. \n “Earlier on, I was always the very vocal kid in class, but I was afraid to make mistakes in French. One day I realized, ‘This is like playing a part in a play or in a performance of some sort,’” said Hughes. “I encourage even my more timid students to realize, ‘Hey, you can make fun of my accent. You can make fun of what I’m doing.’ So I think [the best part of teaching is] just seeing that light bulb go on, the eureka moment when the student really gets it.”\n Teaching at Andover, however, was an unexpected opportunity for Hughes. “I found Andover on the Modern Language Association’s job-list website. I was working at Allegheny College, and I was in a one-year position, and Andover was the only high school on the list,” said Hughes. “I knew I was interested [in the job] because it allowed me to do really high-level academics and teaching, but also to coach and to work with young people, which is what I’ve been doing all my life. This seemed like the best of both worlds for me.”\n Hughes is involved in a variety of different activities on campus, including coaching JV Football and JV2 Girls Basketball, house counseling in Tucker House and helping French Club. On Tuesday nights, Hughes can be seen at the French table in Paresky Commons, conversing with native speakers and novices alike.\n Despite his active schedule, Hughes still finds time for his passion for reading at Andover. Especially interested in historical biographies and nonfiction, he is currently making his way through biographies of each United States president in order.\n “You can bring [the biographies] into the cultural perspectives of the class.… If a student is having trouble understanding something about the history of France or of a French-speaking country, then I can say, ‘Well, this is just like what happened in America at this time,” said Hughes.\n Though he is only in his second year at Andover, Hughes is content with his life here. \n “It took me about 15 years to find my perfect job. It’s a really good fit where I can coach and teach and be a house counselor and do all these things,” he said.\n\n', 'May 1, 2014'), ('\nFollowing recent discussions on topics such as race, gender, class and sexual orientation on campus, the Community & Multicultural Development (CAMD) section of next year’s Blue Book will feature a list of words regarding privilege and diversity. \n The “Diversity Dictionary” will aim to give students a vocabulary basis from which they can discuss diversity in all its forms. CAMD staff, members of the Equity, Access and Inclusion Committee and students from Out of the Blue (OOTB) are currently collaborating to create this list which will include a variety of words from many subjects, including “heterosexualism,” “gender” and “microaggression.” \n “Part of the reason, I think, that we don’t engage across cultural differences, across class differences we can go on, is that we’re not confident in our language,” said Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of CAMD. “The thought was that it would be helpful, in the section of the Blue Book that talks about CAMD, to have a brief glossary of terms that we’d like every new student to have some understanding of or awareness of so that they could engage in dialogue about multiculturalism and diversity.”\n “In order to continue with the discussion on campus regarding social change, both within and outside the “Andover Bubble” that accommodates people of varying identities, we need to introduce incoming students to the proper and respectful terms for that discussion,” said Alejandra Uria ’15, a member of the OOTB committee.\n In addition to introducing students to these terms, the creators of the dictionary hope to confront the problem of students feeling afraid or uncomfortable about participating in discussion because they do not have access to the language surrounding the topic.\n “[To] my students earlier on in the year, I asked, ‘Does everyone know the difference between sex and gender?’ Everyone did not know that, and why do we assume that everyone would know that? Because they’re Andover kids, and they’re smart? It’s an assumption. You get into more trouble when you make assumptions,” said Griffith.\n “We’ll start with microaggression, for example. Did you know what microaggression was before this year? That’s a word we expect everybody to know,” she added.\n “We’ve really worked to crunch this list, so this in no way should be taking as the list of terms we hope you graduate knowing. This is what we want you to know when you come in,” said Griffith.\n\n', 'May 1, 2014'), ('\nBrave, compassionate and selfless: these three words encapsulated the spirit of Lieutenant Commander and Navy SEAL Erik Kristensen ’91. Kristensen was killed on June 18, 2005 while rescuing fellow SEALs members in the Hindu Kush, when his helicopter was shot down by Afghan insurgents. The day of his death is the worst single-day loss of life for U.S. Naval Special Warfare forces since World War II.\n“[Kristensen] went beyond what he was required to do at his rank. He didn’t have to go running to the sound of guns to meet the charge and lead the rescue team. He did that for who he was and because he cared so much about the guys that he just got everyone together, jumped on the nearest helicopter and took off as a reaction force. That was exactly who he was — someone who cared more about what needed to be done for the people than about the rules or how he could stand off and get away with not engaging,” said Ryan Rico, one of the Navy SEALs who attended the memorial service for Kristensen held on campus last Friday.\nKristensen was flying with a rescue team to find four SEALs in danger in the Hindu Kush when their helicopter crashed after it was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. While he ended up giving the ultimate sacrifice — one’s own life — during combat, he embodied compassion and the “non sibi” spirit throughout his entire life, even during his Post-Graduate year at Andover.\n“He was a friend who was there always, who would travel great distances and overcome any obstacle to be there. I believe that was [Kristensen’s] greatest gift among many: his ability to always make room for one more friend,” said Melinda Page ’91 in a letter during Kristensen’s memorial service. The service, open to the Andover community, coincided with an exclusive screening of “Lone Survivor,” a movie adaptation of Kristensen’s mission written by Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of the four-men SEALs team Kristensen attempted to rescue.\nKristensen graduated from Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C., before entering a Post-Graduate year at Andover in 1990. After graduating Andover in 1991, he attended the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1995 with Honors, receiving a BS degree in English and French. In 1999, he began teaching English at the Naval Academy.\n“Had he not been a SEAL, I think he would have been a great teacher. He loved teaching English at the Naval Academy,” said Suzanne Kristensen, mother of Erik Kristensen. His dream of becoming a Navy SEAL was achieved in 2001, when he completed his SEAL training as the oldest in his class to graduate from the program. According to his fellow SEALs, Kristensen approached his SEAL training with the same open-mindedness and compassion as he had the rest of his life, without regard for convention or superficial hierarchy.\n“There’s usually that invisible wall that keeps a respectable distance between an officer and an enlisted student, but with [Kristensen], you were more or less on an even level. He was totally for his men, and that kind of a selfless sacrifice about being there for his men is reciprocated by the loyalty we feel for him,” said Marcus Rivchin, a retired Navy SEAL.\n“He would always be open, friendly and approachable, and he had a way about him that made everyone around him at ease and very comfortable,” said Rico.\nThroughout his life, Kristensen valued community and friendship. As a versatile athlete and a lover of sports, Kristensen pursued lacrosse and crew at Andover.\n“He fell in love with [crew] from the moment he was introduced to it at Andover. He went on to pursue it at the Naval Academy, not only because he loved it so much, but [also] for the camaraderie that you get from being a member of the crew,” said Suzanne Kristensen.\nKristensen’s open-minded friendships stemmed from a lifelong independent streak.\n“He was very comfortable in his own skin and never really doubted himself. It didn’t make any difference to him what other people thought or what other people did. Whatever he chose to do, he pursued it,” said Suzanne Kristensen.\nHe was respected by his SEALs teammates as a smart and daring leader who wasn’t restricted by rules to achieve what had to be done.\n“One of [Kristensen’s] outstanding characteristics was that he wasn’t governed by a certain mold. He allowed for a situation to dictate what was appropriate — it didn’t matter to him if it required bending the rules a bit,” said Rico.\nKristensen’s flexibility, independence and ingenuity were visible during his SEAL training when he would circumvent the rules of some obstacles to finish his challenge on time.\n“[Kristensen] would actually be willing to bend the rules and go the wrong way down the Pacific Highway and go around the obstacle course, and we’d show up ahead of time. The instructors would come tearing around the course, irate that we had beat the system and they didn’t know how we’d done it. [Kristensen] didn’t mind leading the guys into camaraderie, and we were proud of him for not sticking by the rules and playing it by politics,” Rico said.\nThe remembrance of Kristensen’s life was a fitting start to Non Sibi Weekend last Friday. Through his actions, Kristensen demonstrated the essence of selflessness and captured the ideal of “non sibi,” translated from Latin as “not for self.”\n“SEALs guys are the most generous, thoughtful, reflective and humble people you’ll ever come across. That is why we are celebrating [Kristensen’s] life on Non Sibi Day. We are hoping that students would see these characteristic virtues in [Kristensen] as something to emulate, no matter what their vocation is,” said Harrison Flynn ’75, a board member of the Executive Committee of Andover and the Military.\nKristensen’s memorial service began at Memorial Place, where students and faculty recognized all Andover veterans who lost their lives with a moment of silence.

Through these events, they hoped to raise student awareness of the administration’s current efforts to help Andover become a “greener blue.”\n “People come, they get their meals, but they have no idea that there are very intentional choices being made while selecting the food that is served in [Paresky]. Wherever we can, we try to bring in organic, locally-sourced food, offering vegetarian meals — those types of things that have a broader, sustainable impact on the local community,” said Debra Shepard, Sustainability Coordinator. \n “The reality is that we are doing a lot [regarding sustainability], and we haven’t really necessarily done a good job advertising it. This is an opportunity… to highlight some of the good practices people are doing on campus so people know that we’re trying to make things better,” she continued. \n Sid Wainer, a vendor who provides daily produce for Paresky, was featured in Paresky on Monday. Stonyfield Organic Yogurt representatives visited on Tuesday, and Brick Ends Farm, Paresky’s composting vendor, demonstrated composting techniques used in Paresky on Wednesday. Representatives from High Lawn Farm, Paresky’s local milk provider, set up their booth on Thursday. North Coast Seafood, Paresky’s seafood provider, will visit today. \n On Wednesday, students, faculty and staff had the opportunity to follow Rusty Langlois, Chief Engineer at the Office of Physical Plant (OPP), for a tour around the power plant and learn about how OPP provides heat and electricity for campus. \n “The intent of the tour was to educate the attendees on how we power the campus. By revealing some of the behind-the-scenes operations, we hope that they will have a better appreciation of the scale and impacts of campus energy consumption,” wrote Shepard in an email to The Phillipian. \n “Also, it’s important to recognize the work which has been done by OPP over the years to maintain a consistent supply of heat and power while reducing local air emissions and greenhouse gases through switching from oil to natural gas [and] employing cogeneration and emission controls technology,” she continued.\n Shepard also organized an Earth Day Art Contest, asking students to create a piece of artwork that fits under the theme of either Earth Day celebration or Andover’s future in sustainability. Artwork will be displayed in the OWHL, and prizes will be awarded to the top entries in each category. The submission deadline is April 25 at noon, according to Shepard. \n On Thursday, Vivian Zeng, Sustainability Coordinator for Aramark, the corporation that provides Andover’s dining services, toured students through Paresky, demonstrating the the eco-friendly features that make Paresky a LEED Silver Certified building. LEED, or Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design, is a green-building certification program that recognizes best-in-class building strategies and practices. \n According to Zeng, many of the ovens currently used in Paresky are much more energy-efficient than conventional ovens. Furthermore, an “electronic eye” system is used for cooling, which means that the ventilation system is engaged only when a sensor detects that oven temperatures are too high. By using more efficient conventional fans in all other circumstances, Paresky has been able to reduce energy use. \n Earth Week celebrations will continue over the weekend, with EcoAction hosting an “Earth Day Fair” on Saturday for students to enjoy activities such as tie dying, “adopt” a plant and green trivia.\n “We hope that our Earth Day festival will increase awareness about environmental issues on campus, give students a chance to learn a little bit more about what EcoAction has been doing and get students excited about the environment through fun, low-key activities,” said Lily Grossbard ’15, Co-Head of EcoAction. \n Jessica Gammon ’14, Co-Head of EcoAction, wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “It’s important for Andover students to better recognize the consequences of their actions. We need to see where our trash goes, how much energy we consume and how much pollution we produce before we’ll be motivated to change our habits or make any kind of difference.”\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nStraight from Hickory, NC, with a heavy Southern drawl and a financial aid scholarship to his name, Chris Hughes ’02 restlessly began his time at Andover in pursuit of self-improvement. \n His arrival marked the beginning of a rocky Andover career that often left him isolated and unhappy, yet also provided the lessons he would use later in life as a Co-Founder of Facebook, Director of Online Organizing on President Barack Obama’s 2008 Campaign and the current Editor in Chief and Publisher of “The New Republic.” \n Hughes returned to campus on Wednesday to speak at All-School Meeting (ASM), where he shared the values that Andover taught him despite his struggles along the way.\n “The reality is that I was not terribly happy while I was here at Andover, but 12 years later, I am more aware now than ever of the positive effect this place had on me. It didn’t make me happy, but it taught me that happiness isn’t everything. It exposed me to a wealth of ideas and provided me with a thirst for knowledge that I am always trying to quench,” said Hughes at ASM. \n One memory of Andover played a pivotal role in Hughes’s life: the Andover directory, or the “Face Book.”\n “[The Face Books] were spiral-bound, and Marc Zuckerberg [PEA ’02] said they used them [at Exeter] too. At that time, the Internet was not what it is today, and people would sit in dorm rooms flipping through what is essentially a directory with people’s ID photos, what year they were and where they were from,” said Hughes during a question-and-answer session following ASM. \n The Face Books he and Zuckerberg used at their respective boarding schools inspired the concept of connections behind the multibillion-dollar social-networking site. After leaving Andover, Hughes attended Harvard where he met Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz and co-founded Facebook, which now boasts over one billion users.\n “I never really imagined that when we started it would touch the lives of hundreds of millions. I really started to see the power that came from a technological platform at this scale,” said Hughes.\n After realizing the power technology had over the lives of others, Hughes channelled the power into something he cared deeply about. Formerly the President of the PA Democrats’ Club, Hughes left Facebook in 2006 to manage President Barack Obama’s online organizing campaign.\n He was the brainchild behind “my.barackobama.com,” the online organizing tool that allowed grassroots supporters to connect and campaign through the Internet. His efforts and innovation helped Obama win the 2008 election. Following his success, “Fast Company” magazine called Hughes “The Kid Who Made Obama President.” \n Hughes’ life, however, was not always so planned and polished. As a new Lower, he often felt lonely at Andover. \n “There were brief moments of bonding with my roommate or dormmates, but those connections were so rare that they seemed like erroneous exceptions to months and months of silence,” said Hughes during ASM. \n Despite his rough start, Hughes found the motivation within himself to pursue activities such as playing tennis and the piano, debating in Philomathean Society and writing for The Phillipian. \n “I discovered something in me. I came out of those moments of solitude with a fierce effort to be better. I read, worked, studied at all hours of every day, in Garver, in my dorm room. I practiced the piano in the basement of Graves [Hall]. I forced myself into Philo, Model UN and wrote my first articles for The Phillipian. The more that I did, the more that I wanted to do. I would not allow myself to fail,” said Hughes during ASM. \n Using the passion he found for journalism as News Director of The Phillipian, Hughes entered the journalism industry as the Publisher and Editor in Chief of “The New Republic,” a 100-year-old political and cultural magazine. \n “I don’t think there’s any better way to discuss ideas, culture and politics. [Journalism] has a large potential to change our lives and the way we live for the better, and isn’t that what we’re trying to do in the first place? But the first geographical place that I started mulling this question what it is to live a meaningful life and what my path is and what I’m going to do was when I was in the same seats that [Andover students] are in now,” said Hughes during ASM.\n While on campus early this week, Hughes also taught a master class with Head of School John Palfrey, sat in on a seminar with students from second-period philosophy and religious studies classes and joined Christopher Jones, Instructor in History’s History-310 class. He also visited The Phillipian’s newsroom and met with the Gender and Sexuality Alliance for dessert.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nIn response to concerns from faculty members, the annual Prize Ceremony will no longer be held during an All-School Meeting (ASM) in late spring. Rather, prizes will be awarded at a separate time in a more intimate and less public ceremony, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life. \n A solution to the problem of finding the right venue for the ceremony has yet to be determined. However, a dinner inviting those receiving prizes has been suggested, according to Murphy.\n The Prize Ceremony was held annually to present awards to students of particular merit during an ASM in Spring Term. In the past, the awards presented during ASM included athletic-merit awards, as well as general prizes for students in different grades.\n Murphy said that one of the faculty’s major concerns stemmed from which departments were selected to give out prizes during ASM. In the past, athletic awards were the only departmental prizes distributed during the ceremony. The Departments of Mathematics and Science, however, have traditionally given out prizes in smaller ceremonies around the same time.\n “I think in our evolution as a school, some people are rightly asking: ‘Why are there athletic awards at the whole school thing, and why not music and theater?’ It’s really a question about which programs are privileged in that meeting,” said Murphy.\n In addition, the faculty felt uncomfortable publicly singling out a single student from a class of highly talented students to receive the award as the best student in their class, according to Murphy. \n “We’re a school of great kids. Why do we make a big deal out of one ninth grader out of 228 of them, and what’s the effect of that on the school?” said Murphy.\n “We’re still trying to figure out how to make those awards in such a way that it’s meaningful for the people who are awarded them, but also not divisive,” he continued.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nSam Worthington ’76, current spokesperson for InterAction, knows that it takes more than just an individual’s dream and passion to bring change to the world. \n A social activist dedicated to solving the issue of hunger around the world, Worthington successfully brought together nearly 80 organizations in 2012 to convince a group of eight countries (the G8) to donate money to feed 50 million poverty-stricken children around the world. \n While the G8 did not pledge to donate the proposed amount of money, President Barack Obama promised enough money to feed 20 million children at the 2012 G8 summit. \n Worthington stressed the importance of uniting different organizations under a common goal. On Andover’s campus, smaller-scale movements such as More Than Just a Number and Feminism is Equality could use the same theory to improve, said Worthington. \n “The point I’ve been trying to make while I’m here is about keep[ing] the passion for each of those individual issues, but the way to make a broader change is the alignment of multiple student issues. The ultimate power in terms of changing student life and norms on campus and beyond is when individual groups find a broader collective goal to work on,” said Worthington in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Worthington helped found the ONE, an advocacy organization of more than 3.5 million people taking action to end extreme poverty and preventable diseases, particularly in Africa. He also began the Hope for African Children Initiative, which has helped over 900,000 children whose lives are affected by AIDS, according to their respective websites. \n Worthington is the current spokesperson of InterAction, an alliance organization in Washington, D.C. of over 180 nongovernmental organizations. InterAction’s organizations all work with the world’s poor to create a more peaceful and prosperous world, according to the organization’s website.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nFuriously shaking from the cold and reading an intelligence report detailing that he and his platoon would soon be completely overrun by a brigade of Iraqi tanks, Seth Moulton ’97 had no other choice but to sit in the mud and hope that he would see the sunrise the next morning. \n “There are times when you say, ‘Why on Earth did I sign up for this? Why am I here?’ But at the end of the day… I didn’t want someone else to be here in my place,” said Moulton in his presentation on service and his experiences in war on Tuesday, April 22, in Kemper Auditorium. \n Moulton, who is currently running for Congress in the sixth district of Massachusetts, has served four tours in Iraq. When Moulton was on his first tour, he supervised an Iraqi radio station, TV station and newspaper.\n When the TV station that he supervised played American movies, the DVDs would be ejected before any content appeared that could upset conservative citizens. One night, the disk was not ejected before a lewd scene, and people took to the streets in protest. This mistake was still his responsibility, Moulton said, even though his base was nowhere near the transmitter.\n “In the Marine Corps, you have a very simple job description: ‘You are responsible for everything that your platoon does or fails to do.’ That’s it. So just think about that. Imagine if your house counselor’s job description was, ‘You are responsible for everything your dorm does or fails to do.’ That’s a heavy responsibility,” he said in his presentation.\n In order to lead his platoon, Moulton supervised the people under him while building trust. In the military, the only way a young soldier would risk his or her life would be if he or she trusts the leader. He argued that today, politicians do not always accomplish what needs to be done and excuse themselves for it, thus eroding trust. \n “You don’t check on the guys at noon or three in the afternoon. You got to check on them at three or four in the morning because it proves that you are willing to be out there in the worst times, when they want to be sleeping, and you want to be sleeping,” he said.\n One way Moulton fostered relationships with his compatriots was by using the different skills in which they were trained to their advantage. As a special assistant to General David Petraeus, Moulton worked with a female lieutenant named Ann Gildroy Fox. If they needed to gather intelligence from the mothers of a family, Fox would go. If they needed to enter a ring of Iraqi men, Moulton would go. It was never a competition between them. Rather, they always worked as a team. \n Moulton’s training process for the Marines, however, was competitive and rigorous. Much of the training process was to become a better soldier. Similar to how at Andover, the goal is to become a better student.\n “All of a sudden there’s this moment that I experienced when I got out of training, and I met my platoon for the first time, where the tables are turned completely. And all of a sudden it wasn’t about me at all. I graduated, I made it all the way through. I worked really hard to do that, but then I met 36 young, American men, mostly between the ages of 18 and 22, and I was responsible for keeping them alive,” Moulton said.\n “Anything that I had worked hard to better in myself was just so that I could do a better job of being there for them,” he added.\n Moulton was never interested in politics or government while he was at school, but after witnessing the results of bad decisions made by national leaders, Moulton now sees the changes that can be made in veterans care, health care, the district’s economy and foreign policy after returning from his tours.\n He said that for him, success in life was the product of serving the country in the Marines and avoiding the common path of success that he could have taken after graduating from Harvard.\n “I saw, every single day in Iraq, the impact that leaders could have… If you can have the courage to stand up and do what’s right, even if it is difficult or unpopular, you can have an impact, and you can make a difference. I did not agree with the Iraq War, and I didn’t agree with a lot of the policies in the Iraq War, but I had a tremendous impact on how it was executed because every single day I had to make decisions that impacted the lives of other people,” said Moulton in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Moulton said that he has never regretted his decision.\n “I just believe in service, and I actually enjoy service too. And that’s not something I knew when I went into the Marines. I really felt that it was the right thing to do, but it felt more like a chore. I would do my four years, and then I would go on to do different things, but I realized that I enjoyed serving others so much that it was actually a hard decision to leave the Marine corps, and it’s been why I’ve been anxious to get back and do a service job ever since,” Moulton said.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nThe Clutch Collaborative inspired and empowered students to make change with their annual conference on April 20 in Kemper Auditorium. The conference featured three alumni speakers: John Kluge ’01, Sam Worthington ’76 and Heather White ’76. \n This year’s speakers covered the topics of global sanitation, global social movements and labor rights. \n John Kluge ’01 spoke about his passion for social innovation in global sanitation and his organization, Toilet Hackers.\n Heather White ’76 screened a preview of her documentary “Who Pays the Price: The Human Cost of Electronics” and shared her experience making the film. \n Sam Worthington ’76 discussed methods of creating effective social movements and advised students involved with the Feminism is Equality and More Than Just a Number movements on campus. \n The Clutch Collaborative organizes events to encourage students to get involved in social entrepreneurship on campus. \n “Jordan [Boudreau ’14, Co-Chair,] and I were really happy with the conference this year.

Through these interviews, White heard stories of mistreatment, neglect and injustice. \n White, founder of Verité and New Standards, two organizations that seek to improve global working conditions presented on labor rights issues in China, especially as they pertain to teenagers.\n Before starting her own ventures, White worked with various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with the aim of addressing labor violations in overseas factories that produced American consumer brands. White said that China’s labor regulations, however, intrigued her the most.\n In 1995, White started a non-profit organization called Verité, dedicated to investigating labor rights issues, despite the potential risks in her initiative.\n “I ignored them and decided to take it on because the reality of the working conditions in the Chinese factories was hard to ignore,” said White.\n “[Verité’s] mission was to ensure that people around the world work under safe, fair and legal conditions. When the organization was just getting started, I would go to companies and organizations and ask them if they would want [us to investigate the labor conditions of these places] by us on their behalf,” she said.\n Now, not limited to just China, Verité has expanded their investigative work to 60 other countries.\n Just one year after creating “Verité,” White stumbled upon an article in the “New York Times” about clinics being created near Hong Kong for the sole purpose of hospitalizing and providing care for teenagers who were seriously injured as a result of being exposed to toxic chemicals in the factories, primarily benzene. \n “It is so tragic and heartbreaking to see these kids’ lives changed forever. There’s a lot of workers with serious injuries due to benzene poisoning, and in addition to that, they are involved in a struggle for compensation because factories are refusing to pay compensation to the teenagers who have been disabled for life and may never be able to work again,” said White.\n White said that factories are also bribing hospitals and doctors to give false reports determining whether accidents occurred as a result of benzene poisoning. \n “One patient that I interviewed had a difficult time to just even get the proper diagnosis for medical care… By the time he was diagnosed, he had lost a year of medical care and his illness was much more advanced,” she added.\n Lacking the proper funding to conduct research, however, White’s intervention was stalled until 2013 when she was able to finally pursue her investigation on the injured Chinese teens in electronic factories, the sites of the most benzene poisoning cases.\n White’s six-month trip to China allowed her to interview thousands of factory managers and workers, all of which would be compiled into the documentary “Who Pays the Price.”\n One of such workers was Ming Kunpeng, a teenage-worker in a computer-chip factory who suffered from occupational benzene poisoning as a result of constant exposure to the poison.\n “Six months after I met Ming, he committed suicide, and I still remember every moment of that day. He had struggled for three years with repercussions from his benzene poisoning and an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant. As a result, he suffered from depression. Even when he was deathly ill, his parents still had to fight [for] compensation from the factory to give him an occupational diagnosis and legal, correct paperwork to show that the factory was responsible for his benzene poisoning.”\n Through this documentary, which was screened during the conference, White aimed to expose the injustices brought onto these workers in factories to one day stimulate change in labor-rights policy.\n “Big companies such as Apple, Nokia and Samsung are starting to listen to these petitions. We definitely have roles as consumers. We all have the ability to influence the lives of these workers as consumers,” said White.\n\n', 'Apr 24, 2014'), ('\nDuring the American Civil War, between 2 and 3 percent of the nation’s population died. Transposed to today’s population, this percentage of deaths would amount to seven million American citizens dying in one war, according to Drew Gilpin Faust, President of Harvard University and American historian. \n Faust and Ric Burns, a documentary filmmaker, visited Andover’s Cochran Chapel on April 15 to discuss the effects of the war on the nation’s policies and the societal view of death as an intimate part of life itself. \n The presentation was a part of “Lest We Forget,” a series of events hosted by the Andover Historical Society in conjunction with other supporters to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War and the part that it played in the history of the town of Andover. \n Burns’s documentary “Death and the Civil War” is based off of Faust’s acclaimed book “This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War.” The book won the 2009 Bancroft Prize, was a finalist for the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize and was one of the “The New York Times”’s “Ten Best Books of 2008.” Andover students had the opportunity to see the movie at a screening last Friday or through Andover’s Mediaspace hosting server. \n “What I love about history is I see myself differently when I see the past making different assumptions than the ones we make today. What struck me in my journey into 19th-century death was how we as a society don’t talk about death and try to hide death. In the 19th century, they needed to think about death all of the time, because only then could you live your life to the fullest,” Faust said. \n Today, relatively few members of the United States population are involved in war. Unlike the 19th century, when it was expected that every male citizen would fight, less than 2 percent of families in the nation have members who participate in the military. Death permeated all households during the Civil War, exasperating the sense of loss throughout the nation, according to Faust. \n “We can compartmentalize our wars in a way that was not possible to do in the Civil War, as Andover so powerfully represents. Despite this distance from the frontline, the war took place here for the families of the loved ones who lost their lives,” said Faust. \n Burns said that, before the Civil War, the federal government did not have methods and procedures for handling the dead and notifying the kin of the fallen soldier. There were no ambulances or army hospitals. Bodies would remain on the battlefields for days. What once was the duty of the widows and kin to find their missing loved ones and give them proper burial services became a national responsibility. \n “When we think about 19th-century history in the United States, I think that we have to think of the nation as in mourning and uncertainty and ask ourselves how much of what we look at when we look back needs to be considered in the context of that loss and of the people who had no basis for what we call today ‘closure,’ just because they didn’t know what had happened to their loved ones. It’s made me revise my whole understanding of what came after the war,” Faust said. \n Burns added, “Death was preserved in individuals and their families and maybe a group of people who lived in their town before the Civil War. The work of death, which [Faust’s] book has shown so many of us, was the work of communities, families and individuals. We did not think of the work of death as being the work of the country.”\n National cemeteries, including Arlington and Gettysburg, were direct results of the war and the initiatives taken to rebury soldiers who had previously been interred in hastily-made, shallow graves, according to Burns. \n In particular, African-American soldiers saw the worst of this carnage. Oftentimes, they were the soldiers given the task of moving the corpses into makeshift graves, according to Faust. \n “The experience of death was so much more common and so much more part of the familiar tool kit of experience for enslaved African-Americans in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries,” said Burns. “There were a myriad of ways to die. The normal ways in which one assumes they have some control — you have control over your body, you cannot be killed without justice being visited upon your murderer — these were things not available to slaves.”\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2014'), ('\nA group of Brazilian students and faculty members from Escola SESC de Ensino Médio (SESC), Andover’s partner school located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will visit Andover’s campus this week. During their week-long visit, the Brazilian students look to expand their knowledge of American history and literature. In particular, they will interact closely with Andover students participating in PLACES, a new foreign exchange program for Andover students between Andover and a boarding school in Brazil. “[The exchange] will also give [Andover students] another lens into Brazilian culture and the types of things that Brazilian teenagers enjoy and do. The SESC students can also give a bit of a heads-up about what to expect when we’re visiting their school,” said Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English and Director of Brazil PLACES. Andover faculty members across various disciplines, including art, math, English and environmental science, have extended their welcome to SESC students and invited them to sit in on their classes. “Our hope is that [the SESC students] will really meet many more students than just those who are specifically assigned to them and that a lot of what they end up doing on campus will be directed by their interests and whatever it is that they will find fun and enriching,” Vidal said. “I think just having visitors on campus opens the minds of our [Andover] students to a variety of different perspectives, and that’s definitely something that we want to instill in our students,” she continued. In addition to interacting with the Andover community, the Brazilian students will travel to the area around Boston over the weekend. “One of the things that they want to do while they’re here is take advantage of the Boston-area attractions that have to do with American historical and literary events… We’re going to do the Freedom Trail, to Walden Pond and to Lexington and Concord. Just a lot of different places that are important to the material that they’re studying,” said Vidal. While all the other summer trips run by Andover involve students traveling to foreign countries, PLACES is unique because of its exchange aspect, which allows more students the opportunity to learn about other cultures without leaving campus. “We want to really foster this kind of collaborative partnership as a model to teach our kids how to interact with one another and with students of different places and how to form partnerships. I think that’s one of the things we believe is a necessary 21st century skill,” Vidal said. Madison Pettaway ’17, who will be travelling to Brazil this summer with the PLACES program, said, “I want to learn of [the Brazilian students’] interests and their lives in general. Currently, all I know from Brazil comes from Vidal’s anecdotes and from the historical information provided to us in class.

Wright and Casagrande did not place in the top five teams this year, despite placing fifth at last year’s competition. The competition constituted of two written sections and one oral section. In the conversation round, judges who were fluent in Japanese asked the team questions. Their responses were then scored on the difficulty and accuracy of the grammar used and the flow of the sentence structures, Casagrande said in an email to The Phillipian. In an email to The Phillipian, Wright said, “My Japanese classes at Andover prepared me well for the oral portion of the competition; I feel very comfortable speaking and understanding spoken Japanese from my classes. The written portion of the competition, however, included many obscure details of history and culture that are not part of the Japanese curriculum [at Andover].” Outside of the competition rounds, Casagrande and Wright met students from the Japanese School of New York and practiced conversational Japanese with other students from across the country. Other cultural activities apart from the competition included a traditional incense ceremony and a presentation by the inventor of “Sudoku” puzzles. Students also met a former ambassador to Japan from the United States and watched a performance by Taiko, a popular Japanese drumming group. “This year, I gained more of an understanding of how to interact with real Japanese citizens, high-school age and adult, and my experience heightened my goal to become fluent one day,” said Casagrande. Any school with a Japanese program can register for the competition. In order to participate, a student must be in a second-, third- or fourth-year Japanese class, cannot speak the language at home and cannot have spent over three combined months in Japan during a homestay program, according to Wright. “The Japan Bowl helped to remind me of the importance of Japanese in the global economy and political sphere today; language has the power to bring people together and help to solidify relations between allies. It’s very motivating to be surrounded by adults, both Japanese and American, who have studied English/Japanese and have made a living for themselves with their foreign language skills,” said Wright.

Around 10 to 20 students participate in the Open Round each year at Andover, according to Maria Litvin, Instructor in Mathematics and Computer Science. \n NACLO is a high school competition in linguistics that requires no previous linguistic knowledge and helps students learn about common linguistic patterns while using logic as a tool to translate a diverse set of languages, according to the NACLO website.\n “[The NACLO problems] are basically logic puzzles with a linguistic flavor to them. The classic type of problem is one where you are given a bunch of sentences written in a language and you are given their English translations, and, based on that information, you have to extrapolate and perform some translations,” said Bloxham.\n Computational linguistics was developed as a branch of artificial intelligence that relates to the production of human languages and other aspects of linguistics, according to Elizabeth Meyer, Instructor and Chair in Classics.\n Although NACLO does not require previous experience in linguistics or a secondary language, Bloxham partially attributes his success to his background in Latin.\n “Latin’s endless syntax and grammar rules prepare you to encounter languages with similar complications in the problems,” said Bloxham.\n Bloxham was inspired to pursue computational linguistics when Meyer gave him a set of sample problems in class one day. His interest in Latin, coupled with a love of logic, pushed Bloxham to sign up to take the NACLO.\n “Honestly, I just do these contests for fun. I don’t really consider myself a linguist, even though I am now on the IOL team. I would encourage people to take the [NACLO], if anything just because the problems encourage a good logical way of thinking,” said Bloxham.\n “I just want to make sure that I get zero credit for anything that he has done with computational linguistics.

The discussion centered around topics of privilege, including privilege of ability, race, gender, sexual orientation, class and many others. \n Five student panelists were invited to speak about their experiences with privilege: Malina Simard-Halm ’14, Robert Rush ’14, Kailash Sundaram ’15, Kayla Thompson ’15 and Emma Kukielski ’15 all shared stories about their connections with privilege, each bringing a different perspective to the conversation.\n Each panelist was given the opportunity to speak briefly about what privilege means to them and what kinds of privilege they either have or do not have.\n Kukielski discussed the idea that, as a white woman, she was the only member of the panel who had personally experienced the benefit of white privilege, or the societal institutional benefits white people have because of the color of their skin.\n “That’s one of the things about privilege. It’s something that, as a person of privilege, you don’t need to think about. You accept it as a part of your daily life, and that’s why we’re here today. Because it’s something that needs to be confronted,” said Kukielski.\n Kukielski first understood her white privilege when she realized that she lacked privilege as a woman. \n She said, “It was clear then that some people do experience inherent privilege. For example, I can’t walk down the street at night and feel completely safe, no matter where I am.”\n Rush spoke about how his privilege of attending Andover, a prestigious school, saved him from a situation of being treated very differently because of the color of his skin. When a police officer in a New York subway station stopped Rush on his way to catch the subway, the officer’s opinion of Rush shifted when Rush informed the officer of his education, Rush said.\n “Being in this position and seeing how he looked at me after he realized what school I go to… The potential that I may have to change things in this world, the potential I may have to be something other than the expectation he had of me made him let me go. Not the fact that I was a human being,” said Rush.\n Simard-Halm addressed the issue of not having the privilege of being able to be a part of a family that is socially accepted everywhere and having to deal with hatred and discrimination because of her family. Simard-Halm has two gay fathers. \n Simard-Halm talked about her childhood as one of the first children born through assisted reproduction to gay parents and her experience in different communities as she dealt with hostility towards her fathers and her family.\n “I oftentimes felt torn between sharing one of the most important parts of my life, my family, and being a part of the community that I wanted to be,” said Simard-Halm.\n She continued, “I remember moving to New Mexico from Los Angeles… I remember not telling anyone about my parents for three whole months. In fact, I lied about my parents. I said one of my dads was my uncle because I thought that I would be ostracized.”\n Sundaram focused on the concept that, despite having been born and having grown up in the United States, he is oftentimes considered un-American because the way he looks does not fit the American ideal in a country that is considered to be diverse.\n “I was at the airport with my family… The pilots come over, and I start a conversation with them. The pilot’s about to go, and then he says, ‘Enjoy your stay in America.’ For me, that definitely felt like he thought I was foreigner in the country that I call home,” said Sundaram.\n Thompson also spoke about the implications of an intentionally diverse community. When she first arrived at Andover, she surrounded herself with friends of similar backgrounds. \n “Intentionally diverse communities mean absolutely nothing unless you make them mean something. I didn’t get the experience of interacting with people who I didn’t interact with growing up because I didn’t let myself,” she said.\n Moderators from More Than Just a Number and Out of the Blue, including Dan Wang ’14, Thea Rossman ’15, Alex Thomas ’15 and Jaleel Williams ’15, kicked off the forum with statements posed to the audience about different kinds of privilege they may have encountered in their lives.\n After panelists spoke, the attendees broke up into smaller groups to discuss privilege. Many shared personal stories about their experiences with privilege in its many forms.\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2014'), ('\nIn 2006, Sunita Williams, NASA astronaut and United States Navy officer, floated about the International Space Station (ISS) 220 miles above the earth’s surface. Looking out the large window — known to astronauts as the Cupola — for the first time, Williams gazed at Earth from space.\n “It was overwhelming. I’m not joking… the first time up there, you look out the window and you’re like, ‘Wow, those guys were right! The earth is round,’” said Williams during Wednesday’s All-School Meeting (ASM). \n Williams, this year’s Earth Day Speaker, shared her experiences exploring the depths of space and the challenges she faced as an flight engineer on the ISS. After, Williams answered questions during a discussion over lunch in Paresky Commons. \n Williams made her first journey to the ISS aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery with the crew of the STS-116. There she joined the Expedition 14 crew as a flight engineer. Prior to arriving at the ISS, Williams went through eight years of extensive training to prepare her for life in space. Williams made a second journey to the ISS in July of 2012 and stayed for four months.\n After starting her professional career in the military as a helicopter pilot, Williams’s curiosity regarding the aeronautics of helicopters grew, leading her to attend test-pilot school. While at test-pilot school, Williams went to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, to meet astronauts for the first time. After being encouraged to apply by friends who had already been accepted into the astronaut program, Williams took the leap and applied.\n “The thing that comes back to me was ‘the only one who’s telling me that I’m not going to be an astronaut right now is me,’” said Williams.\n Williams underwent basic astronaut training. Stressing the mental preparation required for space exploration, Williams said she attended the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). At the NOLS, NASA astronauts explored the wilderness to learn many team-building skills, as well as survival skills that could be translated into work on the ISS. \n “It is a good way to learn that not everybody learns the same way. Not everybody thinks the same way when you’re in that type of environment,” said Williams.\n In addition to completing a NOLS course, Williams lived underwater for nine days in a habitat that imitated the effects of space on the human body. \n “It’s like you’re stuck at the Depths of the Key Largo, you can’t get out; you are with a certain group of people and you are doing science experiments,” said Williams.\n “The main goal really is to test yourself, so you know which buttons get pushed on you, that piss you off, and you can sort of anticipate that when you’re living in space,” she added.\n Williams said that there were many challenges that she could not have anticipated, with one of those being sleep deprivation.\n “You block out a time for eight hours, and you probably don’t get as good sleep, so you probably get anywhere from five-and-a-half to seven hours of sleep,” said Williams.\n Even though Williams was busy carrying out her duties as an engineer on the ISS, she still made time for two of her passions, athletics and philanthropy. In 2007, Williams was able to participate in the Boston Marathon from space. Running the race on a modified treadmill with a harness over shoulders to counteract the effects of zero gravity, Williams ran the race in four hours, 24 minutes. \n “I like to work out. I think it’s important and something we have to do as astronauts because of problems with bone density and muscle loss and just being normal when we reach the next planet, eventually,” said Williams.\n Though she is now retired, Williams said that she “would love to go back out [to space].” \n “I’m lucky I have had some really good times in space,” said Williams. Williams said if she were to return to space, she would want to become more involved with social media.\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2014'), ('\nSeth Godin, “New York Times” Bestselling Author and Blogger, stood before 2,200 health professionals and students in Yale University’s Shubert Theatre as he talked about the effective strategy needed to communicate ideas. Nestled among the audience were 14 Andover students, members of Andover Global Health Initiative (AGHI) on their weekend trip to Global Health and Innovation Conference (GHIC).\n “The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe having average products for average people. That’s risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable,” said Godin.\n Last Friday, AGHI traveled to Yale to participate in the conference, hosted by Unite For Sight, a non-profit health delivery organization committed to promoting high-quality healthcare for all.\n According to Unite For Sight’s website, the GHIC’s main purpose is to unite those interested in global health, international development and social entrepreneurship to create an exchange of ideas and an understanding of new developments in the fields of global health and entrepreneurship.\n The conference hosted over 300 speakers, providing a variety of “innovation sessions,” as Unite For Sight’s website called them, for participants to attend, such as lectures on the application of film to engage and educate members on new developments in global health and technology pitches on mobile applications to help report results of Rapid Diagnostic Testing in Columbia. \n “One person I found particularly fascinating was Jeffrey Sachs. He talked about how the world is changing and how we need to take control of our actions and how that is affecting communities worldwide,” said Graydon Tope ’14, Co-Founder and Co-Head of AGHI.\n “What I find so ironic [about what he said] is that people will listen to all these wonderful things that come at them, yet they fail to take action: they don’t do anything. So what I feel is great about us is that we’re young enough to know that we have a future ahead of us and that we can actually do something, so that’s what is so powerful,” she continued.\n Hector Cho ’15 added, “There was this group called Prometheon Pharma, a biotech startup out of the University of Florida, who pitched one of their products at one of the innovation sessions. As opposed to having the patients carry around a needle and a pump, the patch is just much simpler, cheaper and more discrete. To be one of the first to learn about the latest advances in both the pharmaceutical and traditional biology world is quite amazing.”\n In addition to the array of “innovation sessions” that members of AGHI attended, members of the club also had the opportunity to network with health professionals, CEOs and graduate students to establish relationships for future use, according to Cho.\n “The majority of the time, I got the speaker’s contact information so I could later shoot them questions. For instance, I even got the email of the founder of Theo Chocolate, who gave a presentation on building responsible business models,” said Tope. \n “Also, I remember some random person on the street for no particular reason, and as it turned out, he was [a health professional] at Yale for the conference and gave me his contact information,” she continued.\n The Andover Participants were Caroline Chen ’14, Co-Founder and Co-Head of AGHI, Graydon Tope, Meera Bahn ’14, Cho, Alessa Cross ’16, Rachel Gerrard ’15, Alexandra Houle-Dupont ’15, Chris Li ’15, Felix Liu ’15, Michael Ohakam ’15, Amelia Rider ’17, Soha Sanchorawala ’14, Erica Shin ’16 and Parker Tope ’16.\n The Andover Global Health Initiative, created last year by Chen and Graydon Tope, is grounded in their belief of “the agency of people to affect change.” Their motto, “Educate, Inspire, Act,” guides their club meetings and represents the goals of their efforts.\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2014'), ('\nAlthough his hands are full with teaching three sections of History 310 and coaching Instructional Swimming, Noah Rachlin, Instructor in History, manages to find the time to slip away to the beach to catch some waves on the weekends. \n Rachlin has always had a special place in his heart for the water, even before he developed his passion for surfing while working as a lifeguard after his college graduation. \n “That started it, and I would surf in the summers out on Cape Cod. Then, when I moved to California, that gave me a lot more water time year-round, so I just kept doing it. Now, I’ll try to duck away whenever I can to get into the ocean,” said Rachlin.\n One of the many things that Rachlin loves about surfing is the pure, unbroken concentration that comes while he’s on a wave. He explained that, in such a highly connected world, there are few instances where he can focus on one thing without any distractions.\n “I realize as the ride comes to an end that I haven’t thought about anything other than the experience of riding the wave while I was doing it. It’s so immersive… I really just enjoy the opportunity to step away, and I think it allows a little bit of space both physically and mentally, and it hopefully makes me better at my job, in part because it helps me to be energized in working towards the things that I care about,” he said. \n “My first-period class might even notice that I’m in a slightly better mood on Monday morning,” he added.\n Rachlin often applies lessons he learnt through surfing to the classroom to further enhance his students’ academic experiences. \n “Just because something is hard, that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun. I found surfing incredibly hard to learn. In short, it takes a lot of time and frustration to get better… But it’s incredibly gratifying to feel as though I’m working hard at something and improving over time. That’s rigor and joy,” said Rachlin.\n “Hopefully students feel as though they’re also being pushed to grow and to further develop in a multitude of ways, but they’re also feeling as though we’re having fun along the way… The way I construct an individual class session emanates from a place of trying to think about that balance,” he continued. \n Rachlin’s passion for surfing stems from his experience as a swimmer. Throughout his high school and college years, Rachlin swam competitively. \n “In swimming, you’re racing both your competitors and the clock. That means that it’s possible to swim a best time and lose a race… This is combined with the fact that most swimmers train all season for a single meet, and you’re always racing a clock, which, in essence, you can never beat. While I definitely didn’t internalize this message at a young age, competitive swimming says something powerful about the nuanced nature of success and failure,” wrote Rachlin in an email to The Phillipian. \n “I think that’s a particularly important lesson that I try to bring into the classroom as much as possible by encouraging students to see their academic experience, both in my class and others, as not just a series of formal assessments to be deemed ‘successes’ or ‘failures,’ but instead as a more nuanced and complex path of growth and development,” he continued. \n In addition to his weekend surfing adventures, Rachlin also often participates in triathlons. He even aspires to compete in the IRON MAN World Championship, which is known to many as the most physically rigorous and mentally demanding triathlon in the world.\n “It’s one thing to dabble in these smaller-distance triathlons, but there’s a part of me that thinks that it would be really cool to do something like that one day. It’s wild. Somewhere in my mind as a possibility for something I want to do, it’s out there,” said Rachlin.\n Rachlin came to Andover from the Pacific Ridge School in Southern California. After earning his Masters in Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Rachlin worked with a group of people in 2007 to start Pacific Ridge, a new independent school in Carlsbad, CA. \n “[Pacific Ridge] was a really phenomenal experience, and I felt really good about the education we were providing for people who were there. I think it’s been really interesting to have this experience of transitioning from a school that was really building from the ground up to coming to a place that was founded in 1778,” he said. \n “Andover stood out to me as a unique place that had a balance of things that I was looking for,” he continued.\n\n', 'Apr 17, 2014'), ('\nOutgrown LEGO building blocks will now have a place at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology (the Peabody). The new program, “Building Blocks of History: Using LEGOs to understand architecture in the ancient world,” aims to engage participants by exploring the convergence of architecture and history in different cultures through building LEGO structures. First proposed by Ryan Wheeler, Director of the Peabody Museum, the LEGO program will allow people to learn in an untraditional and engaging manner. In the program, the only LEGOs currently available to use are 2×4-hole blocks, forcing the visitors to use a limited set of materials to build their structures. “Struggling through the activity allows the group to discuss and think about how people in the past had to ensure that they would have the correct variety of building materials throughout the entire building process,” said Wheeler. “This type of tangible emotion — frustration — really allows the participants to begin to [experience] what people in the past [experienced], even if it is very limited. This type of connection would not have been possible if LEGOs and creating actual constructions was not a part of the activity,” he continued. During a given session, the staff members running the activity ask participants questions in order to spark conversation and debate about how ancient people created the structures and why they were created, according to Randall. Questions asked by Peabody staff revolve around topics such as materials that were used to build ancient structures, the differences between Mayan and Egyptian pyramids and the structure’s purpose. Randall said that staff members will conclude the activity by asking participants to reflect on their own structures, on the challenges they faced in the design process and on the strategies used to successfully design the structures. During prospective parents’ visits last week, the Peabody Museum conducted a trial run of the new program. The Peabody hopes to continue the program on weekends such as Parent’s Weekend, Grandparent’s Weekend and Alumni Weekend. The next offering of the program will be Saturday, May 10, which is during Grandparent’s Weekend. Randall sees the program expanding to other areas on campus, specifically the Addison Gallery of American Art. “We would love to be able to collaborate with them on something related to this activity,” said Randall. Randall hopes that the Peabody could work together with other groups on campus to explore the “Building Blocks of History.” The program plans to be available to visitors during “weekend events.” The Peabody experimented with the program during last week’s Revisit Days and will hold its next session during Grandparent’s Weekend.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nA projector flashed the image of a girl wildly dancing, as if she couldn’t care less if someone were watching, onto a wall of the Gelb Gallery. This animation, by Rebecca Savord ’15, and the other pieces of art that surrounded it, were original works by female Andover students in celebration of Coed@40. \n According to Peg Harrigan, Instructor in Art, a Girls Leadership Project (GLP) committee of 12 girls selected pieces of artwork to showcase the range of artistic talents of Andover girls.\n As the animation faded, it made way for footage of several girls describing their passions. One girl, Alex Kim ’17, discussed her love for figure skating. \n “Figure skating is my second home. I am always learning to trust myself, and know that no matter how many times I fall, I will always try again,” said Kim in the video. “I don’t think I will ever go to the Olympics or win that gold medal, but every time I get off the ice, I come away stronger and happier. To me, that’s what a passion should do for you, and if you ever find something like that, don’t let it slip away.”\n Another artist, Rosie Poku ’17, created a short video about the self-perception of beauty and the skepticism elicited when she asked girls, “Do you consider yourself beautiful?”\n “My intention of the video was to expose that so many beautiful girls here have a serious lack of confidence. These girls should be thinking more highly of themselves, but currently have the inability to do so. I hoped that my video could show that we need to do something to help raise girls’ self esteem. We need to find a way to show girls that they are, in fact, beautiful,” said Poku.\n “When I saw [girls I know] in the film, it made me realize that all of the people I pass [on the path] are really beautiful, and they can’t see that,” said Indy Sobol ’17 of Poku’s film.\n Complimenting the videos, photographs comparing life at Abbot Academy with modern life at Andover scattered the walls of the exhibit. Many of the images were similar, showing that in some ways, little has changed.\n One photograph of former Abbot students holding hands in a winter landscape held eerie resemblance to a recent photo of current female Andover students holding hands while climbing a snowy drift. \n “I found it really interesting, comparing and contrasting the photos from today and Abbot, and to some degree, it was empowering to see all of the incredible artwork by young girls,” said Haley Taylor ’17.\n The exhibition will be on display until April 2.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nPen, paper and iPhone in hand, Benjamin Yi ’14 sat attentively and curiously as he listened to an Abbot alumna recount her high school experience. Yi, along with various Andover students, faculty and staff made the long trek down to Davis Hall last Saturday to participate in an oral history training session as part of last weekend’s Coed@40 celebration. At the event, Maureen Doyle and Charlene Martin, representatives of the Worcester Women’s Oral History Project, an educational organization that aims to raise awareness on the daily lives of women, trained participants on how to conduct proper oral history interviews. After the initial training, Andover participants began to interview various Abbot alumnae, recording their conversations to later be compiled into the Andover Archives to help fill holes in the currently incomplete Abbot Archives. With oral histories, the Archives will have a more complete picture of Abbot life during the 20th century. The interviews highlighted the day-to-day experiences of both Abbot and Andover students, ranging from their dining experiences to where they went when they were sick. “Stories are really important to understanding a system as a whole. Those experiences are also very temporary, so if you don’t get them while they’re here, they’ll soon disappear forever and you will never be able to know of that experience,” said Katherine Vega ’14, who attended the event. “Especially now, at a time where we’re celebrating 40 years of coeducation we are still wondering whether or not girls are equals on this campus, it’s important to see what life was like then and compare that to where we are now,” she continued. The Brace Center hopes to conduct more oral histories of Abbot alumnae in the future, using students and community members to enhance the archival record of Abbot Academy. The Brace Center will achieve this goal through the Brace Research Fellows, a group of students conducting projects on Abbot Academy and its merger with Andover in honor of Coed@40. The Brace Center and Andover Archives will collaborate in hopes of remembering Abbot’s legacy.

Emerson’s video was one of 16 that were chosen for screening at the East Room in the White House from over 2,500 submissions.\n The central theme of all submissions was technology use in today’s classrooms. Emerson’s video, entitled “Tomorrow’s Classroom,” details the importance of globalizing education by focusing on the use of technology in third-world countries to reach out to and work with students can help find solutions to global issues.\n The video was created in conjunction with his eighth grade science course at Brookwood School, and the inspiration came from the school project in which he participated. \n “My old school had a curriculum about developing more efficient cook stoves, working in collaboration with students in Uganda, Rwanda, Brazil — all over the place. I made a movie about that, because it’s fairly innovative,” said Emerson.\n Emerson’s interest in filmmaking began nearly a decade ago. “My first grade teacher… covered all the school meetings at my old school, and I decided to pick up a camera and give it a try,” he said. \n His almost-accidental discovery of videography led to a love for filmmaking. Now, the art of making videos has become much more than a hobby for Emerson, who is taking Art 409, an advanced video course, this year.\n He is also the videographer for Andover Softball, as well as an avid member of the Andover Moviemakers Club. \n “I feel like you can kind of go anywhere with [filmmaking]. There’s an empty sequence, and you can do whatever you want with the camera. It’s a story, and you can do anything you want with it,” said Emerson.\n “It could be your story or someone else’s story in a narrative film or a completely random short story in the case of a narrative scenario. But it’s just kind of a non-linear way to tell [a] story, and it’s creative [and] fun,” he continued. \n Although he does sometimes come up with the ideas and inspiration for his own videos, Emerson said he enjoys handling the technical side of the filmmaking process more.\n “I don’t really have a favorite technique or shot; however, I find I like to use music to aid my storytelling quite a bit. Music helps to give the video the look or feel you want it to have,” wrote Emerson in an email to The Phillipian. \n Currently, Emerson is working on a project to document the behind-the-scenes work at Paresky Commons. \n “I’d like to have videography and filmmaking play a part in my life in the future. Even if it’s just a hobby, I like to experiment with telling stories. Becoming a professional filmmaker would be great, although it’s incredibly hard to become a successful director. It’s similar to the odds of becoming a famous musician or athlete,” said Emerson.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nIn the popular teen comedy “Mean Girls,” Regina George compliments the new girl, Cady Heron, on her looks. When Cady thanks her, Regina is surprised. “So you agree? You think you’re really pretty?” says Regina. According to Rachel Simmons, Cady broke a rule in the girl world: don’t brag.\n Simmons, author of the “New York Times” bestseller “Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls” and “The Curse of the Good Girl: Raising Authentic Girls with Courage and Confidence,” used this scene to kick off her presentation last Friday in Kemper Auditorium as part of the Coed@40 Weekend.\n From early on in their lives, girls develop friendships that forbid them from celebrating their accomplishments and skills, according to Simmons. \n “It’s not only that girls learn not to brag about themselves, but they also learn how to habitually diminish themselves. What begins as a social phenomenon among girls, among friends, migrates into how girls act and think in public spaces as leaders,” she continued. \n This inability to self-promote leads to larger consequences in the workplace, where being able to promote one’s skills leads to higher pay. Based on results from a recent survey cited in her presentation, Simmons said that men with new PhDs were eight times more likely than their equally qualified female counterparts to negotiate with their bosses for more money. When women ask for raises consistently throughout their careers, they earn at least one million dollars more than those who do not ask, according to Simmons.\n Simmons described the curse of the “good girl.” According to Simmons, the “good girl” is one who is smart, hardworking, polite and popular: she tries to please everybody but ignores her own personal pressure to be flawless and to make others happy.\n “I think the ‘curse’ is sending girls two very toxic messages. The first is that being likeable matters more than being confident, and the second is you’re going to be liked when you put others’ feelings and needs before your own,” said Simmons.\n “What is going to push a girl’s hand into the air to express an opinion without disclaiming it first? What is going to volunteer a girl to run for student government and promote herself to get the job? The answer has less to do with what girls need to do to change themselves and far more to do with the culture in which girls come of age,” said Simmons. \n Simmons is the Co-Founder of the Girls Leadership Institute, a national non-profit offering camps and workshops to empower girls and help them develop the tools to express themselves. Simmons graduated from Vassar College, where she majored in Women’s Studies, and she won a Rhodes Scholarship from New York.

The goals of the initiative include assisting with efforts to expand the Abbot archives, supporting Andover’s goal to provide an exemplary coed environment, enabling Abbot alumnae to act as resources to the school, and advising Abbot alumnae on ways to foster meaningful interaction with the school and its students. Hendrix, now program coordinator of the Initiative, said that Abbot alumnae have recently become frustrated with misspellings of “Abbot” in newsletters and mislabeling of Abbot alumnae in photographs in the Andover Magazine. Hendrix said that an article in Andover Magazine’s Spring 2013 issue about the Coed@40 celebrations was “condescending” and “factually incorrect.” Hendrix said that one of the first steps of the Abbot Initiative will be to create a comprehensive webpage. “We want the web page to be an informational ‘clearing house.’ So say somebody is doing an art project where they’re using materials from out of the archives and she wanted to get feedback or hear experiences from any Abbot alums or wanted to get specific donations of letters or diaries that a lot of us alumnae just have just sitting in attics, then she can post about it on the website and get in contact with us,” said Hendrix. In developing a larger connection with the school, Abbot alumnae hope to contribute to the ongoing dialog on topics such as gender, race and socioeconomic status. Hendrix said that such topics were discussed at Abbot Academy at “town meeting,” a form of student government, where students could submit their concerns and the student body would vote on issues. “Town meetings on issues like gender and race and socioeconomic class is one of the possibilities for something that [the Abbot Initiative] would perhaps want to sponsor. One of the things I heard this past weekend is that there isn’t a discussion amongst the school as a whole, including the students who don’t think there’s a problem. A town meeting might be one way to reach out to those students,” said Hendrix. By establishing the Abbot Initiative, Abbot alumnae hope to further cement their roles as resources for Andover community members. “I realized that there were a lot of issues that I had no idea were going on such as the attire for dances. I thought ‘Oh my god, 40 years later and we’re still talking about the same stuff.’ There are so many things that have changed for women and for this diverse student population as a whole, but sadly, so much has remained the same. Since we’ve gone through these issues, we can be helpful and a part of the dialog without pushing any agenda except to be a resource and a contributor,” said Hendrix. The Abbot Academy Steering Committee is currently working on a letter to be sent to all Abbot alumnae asking for their contribution to this endeavor. The letter will introduce the Abbot Initiative to all Abbot alumnae and ask for their support and contributions to the Abbot Archives and webpage.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nIn honor of Andover’s 40th year of coeducation, Abbot Academy alumnae, Andover alumni and current students gathered on campus for various events, including speakers, dance recitals, art exhibitions and panel discussions as part of the Coed@40 Spring Forum. \n “The Coed@40 Spring Forum is intended to generate discussions about gender, race, leadership and social equity, as well as seed important conversations we plan to continue for many years to come,” said Debbie Murphy, Director of Alumni Affairs and Co-Chair of the Coed@40 Committee, on behalf of herself and fellow Co-Chair Tony Rotundo, Instructor in History and Social Sciences and Interim Co-Director of Brace Center. \n The Coed@40 celebrations began on Wednesday, April 2 with a student panel on the intersection between race and gender on Andover’s campus. \n The weekend’s keynote speaker, Rachel Simmons, talked about gender and coeducation in a holistic sense, linking her experience as director of the Girls Leadership Institute with Andover’s current discussions surrounding gender.

Dewitt’s family, as well as families of previous “Run for Troops 5K” benefactors, were present at the fundraising event. \n “It’s not a fund going to an unknown family, and it is pretty special to connect with the person who you are actually raising money for,” said Lang. \n Catherine Haseman ’14, who has participated in the road-race fundraiser every year since her arrival at Andover, said, “The cause is something I feel very passionate about, and what’s great about the race is that everyone there really cares about it, too.”\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nReturning to the very school where she first discovered her passion for teaching, Erin McCloskey ’90 looks to draw from her experiences as a teacher and an online course designer as she steps into her new role as the Associate Director of Academic Technology. McCloskey began her term on March 31, 2014. As Associate Director of Academic Technology, McCloskey will help Andover faculty incorporate technology into the existing school curriculum and maximize the potential of technology in enhancing the overall learning experience of students. She will also work with the Andover Institute and the Strategic Planning Committee in further developing ongoing technology-related initiatives on campus. “For example, there is the iPad initiative. Because the use of iPads and laptops are so prevalent among the students in classrooms, I will help departments and faculty continue to experiment, explore and develop effective ways of using iPads in classroom settings,” said McCloskey. “My job right now is to learn about the initiatives that are already happening on campus. It’s really exciting for me to join something that’s already in motion and to work with people that want to change things up and come up with different tools and techniques of technology that can enhance the learning experience,” she continued. While McCloskey is a huge advocate of online learning, she recognizes that online learning and face-to-face learning have their respective advantages and disadvantages. “I believe that a teacher is most valuable when he or she is interacting with students around complicated topics that require an explanation, but not necessarily when they are presenting simple concepts. Students can often go away and learn some basic concepts on their own, and then come back to the classroom with questions that require a deeper dive,” said McCloskey. “In my experience, you can sometimes have richer discussions in online formats than you can face-to-face. An example of that is when a topic is sensitive. People are in deeper comfort when they have some geographic distance. It might be easier for them to reveal their feelings. In a face-to-face format, you don’t necessarily have the time to reflect because you’re put on the spot,” she continued. After graduating from Andover, McCloskey attended Brown University. She obtained her master’s and doctoral degree in education at Harvard University, became a teaching fellow at Andover and taught for a total of nine years. Immediately prior to coming to Andover this spring, McCloskey worked at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she oversaw and created online programs that taught people how to run online courses.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nThrough various disciplinary cases this month, the administration has become aware of the presence of “sexting,” the distribution of sexually explicit digital material, on campus. \n Although such issues are typically under the radar, a conversation about sexting has now diffused throughout the Andover community, prompting responses from faculty and Head of School John Palfrey, who addressed the subject in an email to the community on Wednesday. \n “Andover doesn’t exist in a bubble, contrary to popular perception from time to time. Sexting is something that we know is commonplace among American adolescents. In some studies, as many as a third of young people engage in this practice and it would be absurd for us to imagine that it doesn’t happen to some degree at Andover,” said Palfrey in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Palfrey reached out to the faculty early this week and asked House Counselors to speak on the subject of sexting in dorm meetings on Thursday night. Day student advisors will talk to their advisees during Advising period today. The topic of sexting was incorporated this week into the Personal and Community Education (PACE) curriculum for Lowers. \n “There have been some concerns this past week about the transmission of sexually explicit images; therefore, it makes sense to talk about that, in whatever way makes sense in any given seminar or section in any given week,” said Carlos Hoyt, Assistant Dean of Students and PACE coordinator.\n Palfrey is no stranger to the world of online risk-taking. In 2009, Palfrey was asked by 49 state attorneys general to chair the national commission Internet Safety Technical Task Force (ISTTF). \n “We covered a variety of topics, but it had to do with social media and safety and kids, ranging from the impact of dangerous content and relationships with strangers to the way in which people can psychologically harm one another through technology. We looked at a very broad range of things and made a series of recommendations about how to address them,” said Palfrey. \n As educators, the school hopes to ensure that students have the facts and, through helping students develop critical thinking skills, they will be able to make good choices, said Palfrey in the interview. \n “I often think about pictures posted online or shared through text — even on Snapchat in an era of SnapSave — as being like tattoos. You may think they look good now, but they are likely to be with you for a very, very long time. You may not like the looks of them when they are visible decades later,” said Palfrey in the email.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nTwenty-two percent of all faculty on campus are of color, according to the Andover website, contrasting starkly with the 42 percent students of color in our intentionally diverse student body. \n This disparity and the overall lack of visibility of teachers of color on campus makes it difficult for students of color to “see” themselves in their teachers and connect with them as role models and mentors, according to Asabe Poloma, Executive Director of the Institute for Recruitment of Teachers (IRT).\n The IRT, an Andover-run initiative that supports graduate students of color pursuing a degree in teaching, serves the larger purpose of increasing the number of teachers of color across the country. \n “Not having a diverse teaching faculty creates the implication that people of color do not have what it takes to succeed in academic professions, reinforcing the normative standards of an educator as white and middle-class,” said Poloma. \n “Because of a recognition that a homogenous culture and non-diverse climate is parochial in the 21st century and out of line with the changing demographics of our nation, the educational imperative is to prepare students for a global, interconnected world, and finally, our democratic ideals of equality,” she continued. \n Recently, the topic of diversity within the Andover community has garnered the attention of students and faculty alike on campus, prompting student panels and the creation of More Than Just A Number, a student group dedicated to furthering the conversation about black and Latino students at Andover. Jaleel Williams ’15 and Kayla Thompson ’15, Co-Head and Director of Forums, respectively, said the lack of diversity within faculty affected their experiences in the classroom. \n “The two times that I have had a teacher who was black, I made a deeper connection with that teacher than with any of the other teachers that I have had,” said Thompson. “I think that that’s because when you see a teacher of the same background as you, especially if you come from an underrepresented background, you feel a stronger desire to want to know them on a personal level and look to them as a mentor outside of the classroom.”\n Additionally, a diverse faculty population allows students to form relationships with adults of different racial backgrounds and helps minority students to find a teacher with whom they can potentially feel more comfortable. \n “I think one of the most important things about racial diversity at Andover is how the representation affects students. So many students look up to their teachers at Andover because you have to be smart and successful to teach at an elite school like Andover,” said Williams.\n Students can benefit immensely from the cultural wealth of knowledge that teachers of color could bring to the classroom. A powerful learning environment is fostered in an inclusive classroom setting in which different voices and perspectives are represented in equal weight, according to Poloma. \n “If a goal of schooling and an institutional strength we tout is to expose students to a diversity of perspectives and ‘youth from every quarter,’ then we should equally strive to have representation from adults from every quarter as well,” said Poloma. \n According to Thompson, the percentage of faculty of color may not be the most accurate representation of diversity among the faculty members at Andover. \n “I think that the statistic is misleading. Firstly, the statistic would be much more useful if they broke down the percentages by race. That way, if one race/background makes up half of the teachers of color, then we see a more accurate depiction of our faculty,” Thompson said. \n “You have to take into account the fact that each department doesn’t have an equal number of people from each background. So if the majority of the Hispanic teachers work in the Spanish department and the majority of the black teachers work in the history department, then students aren’t seeing any underrepresented people of color working in the math or science departments,” she added. \n THE SOLUTION\n Using the IRT and outside diversity consultants as resources, Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty, is working to increase the percentage of teachers of color on campus. Before hiring season this year, Andover faculty participated in workshops run by Diversity Directions, a group that teaches faculty to evaluate resumés and to choose new faculty with an inclusive lens. \n “We are sending six people to a week-long program, including myself and [Head of School] John Palfrey, that will be conducted by Diversity Directions. We have set aside $25,000 for diversity and multicultural training. We are going to review all of our hiring processes from the posting of positions right up to the end of where we actually we make a hire. We want to make sure that in every step of the hiring process, we are promoting diversity,” continued Farrell. \n Farrell is working with hiring procedures to retain faculty of color on campus, making sure that new faculty remain at Andover and can make a difference in the community. \n “We are hoping that the workshops we attend will help in that retention. We will also start instituting exit interviews for faculty that decide to leave the school so we can learn as much as possible if we can as to why they are leaving, and if there is anything we can do better to prevent them from doing so,” said Farrell.\n Poloma said, “I challenge [Andover] to disaggregate the [race] data and discuss ways in which we can enhance or improve on the recruitment and retention of particular underrepresented minority groups in the teaching as well as administrative ranks.”\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nCindy Sorensen AA ’63, a self-proclaimed shy — but scholarly — student, remembers walking across the pathways of Abbot Academy, going to her favorite Spanish class taught by her teacher Ms. Judd, living with a roommate and attending chapel meetings with the student body of around 300 girls. While it has been many years since her graduation, Sorensen still thinks fondly of Abbot while also appreciating the current, co-ed Andover.\n “I loved my two years at Abbot and am very thankful for the opportunity to have gone there. The education that students can receive at [Andover] today, however, is so much richer. It’s clear that there is a diversity of students and faculty that we never had. I had great, supportive teachers and made lifelong friends, but the [Andover] community appears to be one with a more enthusiastic and open communication among students, faculty and staff,” said Sorensen in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Sorensen was one of 28 alumni who joined over 80 current Andover students in a crowded Kemper Auditorium to speak about life at Abbot and Andover for an event titled Gender, Leadership, Mentoring and Networking. The event, held on Sunday, April 6, concluded the Coed@40 Spring Weekend.\n “While this event was not focused solely on women or women’s issues, many alumnae reached out to the alumni office after last year’s school presidential elections on campus and asked if there were ways they could help support students around topics of gender and leadership,” said Debby Murphy ’86, Director of Alumni Affairs.\n Nick Danforth ’60, one of the alumni panelists, detailed his rocky start at Andover.\n “I was very insecure and I had enormous self-doubts when I started [at Andover] in ’56… Things changed when I became the mentee of two men: the minister who was here in 1957, but also the one who really changed me, was a voice teacher. He taught me how to sing and how to speak in front of a crowd. I ended up winning the Draper Prize for public speaking,” said Danforth.\n Danforth also shared his experiences after Andover, in which he used the confidence fostered at Andover to travel to Africa and work in America with the hopes of empowering women and convincing men to join the cause for gender equality.\n The event included breakout sessions where small groups of students traveled to a group of different alumni for discussion. The discussions ranged from where males play a part in feminism to how to seek mentorship to the experiences of women of color at Andover.\n “Sharing my experience at [Andover] with current students helps build confidence that many of students’ concerns, preoccupations, challenges are all part of the narrative that other people have experienced… It helps to know that there are people that they can connect with in order to gain insight, advice, mentorship and camaraderie,” said Kelicia Hollis ’08.\n “I think the best advice that was given from an [alumnus] was that no matter what, after the four years we have at Andover, your classmates won’t see you differently for what you do with your life because such great bonds were formed at Andover. Everyone cares more if you love what you do, rather than what you’re doing,” said Nicole Rodriquez ’17.\n Students and alumnae not only discussed gender, but also the intersection between multiple systems of disadvantage. They expressed interest in more events — like this one — where current students can connect with alumnae for advice and exchange about gender issues, leadership and the Andover experience.\n “Over the past 40 years, many people have done important work to educate both boys and girls in an increasingly diverse community. We can all do better, however, at understanding how gender, race and class intersect to shape people’s experience at [Andover] and how we can improve inclusion and equity,” said Cori Field ’83, Alumni Trustee and member of the Strategic Planning Task Force.\n\n', 'Apr 10, 2014'), ('\nAt a dinner for Abbot Academy alumnae and Andover students on Saturday evening to celebrate forty years of coeducation, Leslie Hendrix ’73 announced the new Abbot Initiative to revamp Abbot’s involvement with Andover going forward.\n The goals of the initiative include assisting with efforts to expand the Abbot archives, supporting Andover’s goal to provide an exemplary coed environment, enabling Abbot alumnae to act as resources to the school and advising Abbot alumnae on ways to foster meaningful interaction with the school and its students. \n “There really should be a place and there should be a way for Abbot alumnae to make a contribution to the school and exchange information,” said Hendrix. \n Hendrix said that, thus far, she has received an overwhelmingly “enthusiastic response” from students, alumni and Head of School John Palfrey since proposing the Initiative. \n In addition to looking ahead to the next ten years, the Initiative will be a forum for discussion and interchange of ideas.\n “[Currently], there’s no real venue for an exchange of ideas,” said Hendrix. “We really don’t have a good idea of what’s going on,” she continued. \n Hendrix and other alumni have already created a steering committee with members from the class of 1973.\n\n', 'Apr 5, 2014'), ('\nSince the beginning of the second civil war in 1998, over 5.4 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have died as different militias within the nation launched raids at one another. The coveted prize? Coltan, a mineral that is found in nearly all cellphones, laptops and other electronics, according to Dr. Peter Eichstaedt. Last Friday in the Mural Room of Paresky Commons, Eichstaedt, a wartime reporter and author of the book “Consuming the Congo: War and Conflict Minerals in the World’s Deadliest Place,” shared his insight with the Andover community on the role of coltan in Congo’s on-going civil war. The Congo is currently responsible for supplying 10 to 15 percent of the world’s coltan. The value of the mineral has increased tremendously since the 1996 Internet boom, causing strife within the nation for control of the market for the mineral, according to Eichstaedt. “This is not a conflict way over someplace strange that has no bearing at all on our lives. Each time any of you pick up a phone, you have a little piece of the Congo in your hands,” said Eichstaedt in his presentation. The fight between the militias has completely torn the nation apart, and millions of people have been killed or forced to fight, according to Eichstaedt. “Those who didn’t [run] were captured, were herded into this school and killed. One guy, one of the militia soldiers, dipped his finger in one of the victim’s blood and wrote this on the wall: ‘We’re just the first wave,’” said Eichstaedt, recounting one of the stories the raid-survivors once told him. “It is absolutely relevant that we as Americans become aware of these issues [of violence in Congo] and do something about them,” he continued. Through his presentation, Eichstaedt hoped to convey to the students the real story behind the ongoing war in Congo. “We [try to help] them write the story and tell their stories in their own words, instead of all the news coming into the United States being filtered through the eyes of Westerners. It’s a term we call ‘parachute journalism,’ where [journalists] parachute into a country, hang around for a week, get a bunch of juicy stories and then fly out…The whole purpose of what I’ve done, my work, is to try to get beyond that,” said Eichstaedt. Eichstaedt’s visit was organized by Andover’s Students Taking Action Now for Darfur Group (STAND), an anti-genocide student group. Kory Stuer ’15, Director of Events at STAND, said, “You get a very filtered, biased understanding of a lot of the instances that are going on [from the media].” Stuer will be succeeding Junius Williams ’14 and Farris Peale ’14 as Co-President of Andover’s chapter of STAND next year, along with Rhaime Kim ’15. “We wanted students in the community to get out of it [a] greater appreciation for the work of humanitarian groups, [a] greater appreciation for journalism [and] a greater understanding of the historical groups of the conflict,” said Williams.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2014'), ('\nOn Friday, April 25, classes and athletic commitments will be called off in honor of the newly reformed Non Sibi Weekend, which will take place that Friday and Saturday. All students will be required to participate in the programming using an online sign-up system. Unlike past years where students were able to choose any project, they will instead have to pick an activity that falls under their grade’s theme, according to a previous article in The Phillipian. Juniors will focus on children and families, Lowers on the environment and sustainability, Uppers on hunger and Seniors on homelessness and housing, according to Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Service. “These are the main social issues that are addressed by a lot of our programming throughout the year. The whole point of revamping this was that it will have a closer tie to what we do throughout the year,” she said. Students who do not sign up will be randomly placed in a project. Cueto-Potts said that this random assignment may conflict with athletic and music obligations on Saturday, which is why it is critical for students to sign up on their own as soon as possible. If assigned to a project that conflicts with a scheduled game, then the student will be required to attend the Non Sibi project. Students will receive an email with instructions and a link to sign up today, and they will have until 10:30 p.m. on April 7 to sign up for a project. Non Sibi Day was created in 2007. Originally, it involved the entire student body and occurred the second week of school. From its inception, the day has taken many different forms. Last year, only new students were required to participate in the program. “We felt as though we needed to revamp the program so all students were participating again,” said Cueto-Potts. “It’s not often that we cancel classes to do something else here, and so I really hope that students are present during that time and really appreciate and are grateful for having a few hours out of one day to go and do something they wouldn’t normally be doing and to learn about issues that are affecting a lot of people and all of us in some way.”\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2014'), ('\nHead of School John Palfrey urged students to make good choices and alerted faculty and students of an uptick in drug and alcohol-related disciplinary cases in an email to the Andover community on March 26. \n “Over the last few years, our instances of drug and alcohol-related discipline has been incredibly low. This year there are more. This is not a situation of huge concern, and this is not a major change in terms of what is happening on campus, but I felt like it was appropriate for me to say what I knew and to say as much as possible at the beginning of Spring Term,” said Palfrey in an interview with The Phillipian. \n In 2011-2012, one percent of the student body were involved in disciplinary cases that dealt with drugs and alcohol. The same percentage held true in 2012-2013. This year, however, two percent of the student body have sat before a disciplinary committee thus far in the 2013-2014 school year, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. \n “We are still below where it has been in recent years, but this is not going in the right direction,” said Palfrey in the interview. \n In his email, Palfrey noted that this uptick has occurred despite the deliberate effort to decrease the number of students enrolled from 1,142 last year to 1,122 this year. \n The result of a disciplinary case dealing with drugs and alcohol typically results in probation and is marked on the student’s college record, according to Palfrey. \n “We are, generally speaking, a second-chance school, which I think is right, and we are generally quite clear about our drug and alcohol policies, and it’s a choice before students on whether or not they are going to abide by it,” said Palfrey. \n “There are so many instances when students will come into my office and ask for a do-over or an exception to the rule and the answer is no. This is just a choice that you’re making,” he continued. \n “The point of the email was not to raise a red flag. I understand this is a high school, but make good choices. I’d rather [students] thought about it in advance,” he said.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2014'), ('\nKicking off the Coed@40 weekend programming, seven students shed light on their experiences with gender and race, an intersection that is often excluded from the mainstream feminism conversation, and, some argued, from Andover’s Feminism is Equality movement.\n “People tend to think of the two issues as taking place in different silos and if you’re talking about gender you’re not talking about race, and usually that means you’re talking about white gender. I thought it was really important for us to use the anniversary events to make the conversation about gender broader,” said Tony Rotundo, Instructor in History and co-chair of the Coed@40 committee, a group of faculty and students organizing events in honor of the 40th year of coeducation. \n The student panelists at the event were Alba Disla ’15, Devontae Freeland ’15, Kai Kornegay ’14, Farris Peale ’14, Soha Sanchorawala ’14, Alex Tamkin ’14 and Daniel Wang ’14.\n Kornegay’s own experience emphasized the importance of acknowledging diversity of background within gender, race and class labels. \n “I could never really separate being black and being a woman, and if anything coming from a race standpoint it almost felt like a privilege to be a black woman. I’m not being read as immediately dangerous and that’s something that a lot of black men have to deal with,” Kornegay said. \n While Kornegay found her experiences with race and gender as synonymous, Freeland grew up with the opposite mindset. \n “My experience with race and gender simply were separate. I didn’t find for the most part any kind of crossover any kind of correlation between [them]… in my town, when you were a boy, in my town, in the fall you played popcorn football, in the winter… basketball, and in the spring you played baseball. Now, if you were black, you played all three of those, and you did it rather well,” Freeland said. \n Kornegay explained her feelings of estrangement from Feminism Is Equality, Andover’s feminist movement from last spring. \n “I think that one of the faults is that they want to be intersectional but they never asked us directly… they never contacted Alianza or AfLatAm and said, ‘Look, we really think this is important we really want you guys to get involved’… I think that that would have been one way the feminist [movement], I think, would be a lot more appealing to me,” said Kai Kornegay. \n Wang described growing up feeling like an “outsider” as a Chinese-American in a predominantly white community. \n “East Asians, Asians, Asian Minorities, are taught from a young age both that ‘you are different, you are the other, and you are inferior’ and that ‘you should not acknowledge it, you should not fight against it, you should not argue against those facts,’” said Wang. \n He reflected on the small moments in his life in which his Chinese heritage and language set him apart from his classmates.\n Disla’s experience as a Latina woman stemmed from the expectation for her to get married and have children early instead of pursuing an education, according to Disla. She began to feel like an outsider when she arrived to Andover’s campus, where the majority of white students differed from her majority-Latino community in Lawrence, and she felt that her academic preparation was inadequate in comparison with her peers. \n “[Before Andover] I never really had to interact with anyone other than the Hispanics. Race wasn’t something that was something on my mind everyday… and then I came to Andover, big shock to me…[and] I started to really see that I was an ‘other’ and I didn’t see it… It was a big blow to my self esteem,” said Disla.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2014'), ('\nFor Amy Chou ’16, a passion for computer science seemed only fitting after the time she spent participating in math contests throughout middle school. After taking an online course the summer before her Junior year, she joined Andover’s Computer Science Club and began participating in on-campus competitions. Last December, Chou was named state recipient of the Award for Aspirations in Computing after applying in the fall of 2013 and will receive her award on April 19. “Students who apply [for this award] who just have aspirations, but don’t have achievements, cannot get the award. In Amy’s case, she has significant achievements already, and she continues on this path,” said Maria Litvin, Instructor in Mathematics and Faculty Advisor to the Computer Science Club. Established by the National Center for Women and Information Technology, an organization that aims to correct the gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, the Award for Aspirations and Computing was created to “[honor] young women at the high-school level for their computing-related achievements and interests. Awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership ability, academic history and plans for post-secondary education.” Chou first realized her passion for computer science in middle school after her dedicated involvement in math contests. Chou, however, soon found herself intrigued by the world of computer science, seeing the parallels between her math contest skills and the skills needed to solve computer science problems. “I took an introductory online course in computer science, and I thought that it was really close to math, which I really liked. The problem-solving part just wasn’t very different… It’s the same feeling I get when I solve a contest math problem, the fact that I know that I can improve in it keeps me going. This year, I started doing a computer science research program at MIT, which is a really big resource for me to go to,” said Chou. Chou found support from her parents, both of whom work in STEM fields, her mother a professor of math education and her father a computer engineer. They encouraged her ventures into computer science because back in her home state of Montana, people — especially girls — were not as interested in STEM fields as students at Andover are, said Chou. “There were definitely fewer resources [where I came from], but [at Andover], it’s not so much the material resources that have helped me, but more the people and the community. There just weren’t as many people who were interested. I don’t know if I would have met a teacher who was as helpful as Ms. Litvin had I stayed back home,” said Chou. Recently, there has been an emergence in computer science competitions specifically aimed toward girls to help reduce the gender STEM gap. Only 27 percent of computer science professionals are female, according to the US Department of Commerce. Chou will be the first girl in ten years to enter an off-campus computer science competition when she participates in the high school programming contest at St. Anselm College this Saturday. Chou believes that more girls have been becoming actively interested in not only computer science but also math and other STEM fields, and Litvin has also seen an upward trend in her classes. “I think girls want to look at the class and see more girls in it, so you see more girls taking these classes, and you think that’s good. A few years ago, I sometimes would have a class with just one girl [or] not a single girl. Now we may have three, four, maybe even five girls.

As in previous years, the process involved a written application, as well as a live audition before an audience of students in Lower Right of Paresky Commons. \n A few of 2014’s BKHs noted that the auditions this year tended to be less sexually oriented than many of last year’s auditions. Instead, most of this year’s auditions seemed to focus on being as humorous as possible.\n “This year, the applicants did a wonderful job of keeping things PG. Last year, there were instances where things had gotten a bit out of hand, but I think the Class of 2015 did a great job of keeping things tame but still creative and fun to watch,” said Nekoroski.\n Gaiss added, “We definitely emphasized that all applicants should keep [auditions] PG. Walking the fine line between being funny while keeping things appropriate is an integral part of being a Blue Key Head.”\n “From the start, the whole process has been so much fun. The audition was one of the best things I have done here at Andover, and I am very excited for the rest of the year,” wrote Jacobson in an email to The Phillipian.\n As part of the auditions, the applicants serenaded their peers, did push-ups, invented and taught the crowd their own creative cheers, pretended to be animals and led cheers to demonstrate their ability to inspire the crowd to get “a little bit rowdy.”\n Irvin said, “The most fun part [of the audition] was definitely the serenade. It’s not very often that you have the chance to completely embarrass yourself, and I had a great time doing it.”\n “The hardest part [of my audition] was trying not to forget the words to ‘Burning Love’ as I serenaded Bryan Ackil because I was just so lost in beautiful blue eyes,” said Dolan.\n Among other duties, the role of the BKHs involves organizing and running new-student orientation, leading cheers at all home sports games and spreading spirit across campus.\n Haseman explained that a BKH’s duty goes above and beyond leading cheers.\n “There is a more personal aspect to it. They are not just Blue Key Heads during their weekly meetings or during football games. It is a 24-hour-a-day commitment, and I hope to see this commitment manifest itself in their everyday attitudes, in their relationships with their friends and in their friendliness toward the rest of the student body,” she said.\n The new BKHs all expressed their excitement as they step into their new roles. \n “This feeling is indescribable… I can’t help but smile and laugh, and this will go down as one of the best days of my Andover career,” said Yost in an email to The Phillipian.\n “Right now I’m essentially lost in euphoria. This is hands down the proudest moment of my life, and I am beyond excited to represent PA with Big Blue Spirit,” said Swett.\n Ogando said, “My goal as a Blue Key Head is to make sure everyone I pass by walk by on the path or anywhere on this campus is smiling and happy to be at Andover.

Hilton already has a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and a Master of Arts in chemistry. For a faculty member to take a sabbatical, he or she must have been teaching at Andover for at least five years. Hilton has only been at Andover for three, so she is taking a leave of absence. Hilton plans to pursue a two-year-long graduate program; taking a sabbatical would require her to come back to Andover after only one year. A leave of absence is more flexible and will allow Hilton to apply for an extension so that she can complete the two-year program. “I’m obviously very interested in chemistry, but I also do a lot of baking. I bake for all the girls’ birthdays in my dorm. I keep track of numbers, and I’ve made them over 1200 cupcakes this year. But food really interests me, so I wanted to combine my interests in chemistry and food and study food science,” said Hilton. Some of the classes Hilton will be taking at Cornell include Food Chemistry, Wine and Food Fermentations and Agriculture in Developing Nations. “An example of something that one might do in the lab is you might be analyzing a sample of milk for particular proteins that might show a cow has a certain issue. Dairy chemistry is one of the main areas for Food Chemistry at Cornell, so there’s a high probability that I’ll be doing research in that area. If I choose to take a biology class, then I might be working on genetically engineered foods,” said Hilton. Hilton, who currently teaches sections of Chemistry 580 and Chemistry 300, looks forward to exploring how her new degree will affect her teaching. “In 300, I’ll be able to incorporate different types of examples into my daily lecture instead of just using the examples that are frequently given in the textbook. So I can take a principal of, let’s say, acid-base chemistry and use an example of food science to illustrate that topic. And then with 580, after the AP, the syllabus sort of goes away, and it’s the teacher’s choice about what to do, so I’d like to do a mini unit on food science,” said Hilton. While she does love to cook, Hilton’s studies at Cornell will focus on the science behind food rather than time in the kitchen. “It’s all very science-oriented and not culinary at all, which is a little sad because I love the culinary side. One day I might want to go to pastry school, but if I went to pastry school, I would want to learn the science behind what I’m doing. Pastry school would incorporate the science and all the practical stuff together. But this part of the journey is just the science part,” she said. Aside from chemistry and cooking, Hilton has many more interests and hobbies, including aerial arts. She hopes to continue pursuing her other interests at Cornell, but also to engage in other new activities. “I am going back to a school environment. It’s like what you [students] do here! There are lots of opportunities to join different groups and clubs. I like things related to fitness, so maybe I’ll join a step team,” said Hilton.\n\n', 'Apr 3, 2014'), ('\nMembers of the class of 2011 in conjunction with faculty members are in the beginning stages of establishing a memorial fund in honor of Mark Adamsson ’11, Andover alumnus and Georgetown student, who passed away while on spring break in the Dominican Republic.\n Adamsson, a native of Stockholm, Sweden, died from lung and heart failure because of medical reasons, according to the “Washington Post.” He was 22.\n “He was a gentleman and a scholar, and he was thoughtful and kind to his peers and the adults on campus, and I was very proud that he represented Andover. I was really shocked to hear that he’d passed away because he was so young and had such promise… People who knew him were all impressed by him. It was a real loss for a lot of people,” said Christopher Odden, who served as Adamsson’s house counselor at Andover. \n While at Andover, Adamsson was a captain of the Boys Varsity A Tennis team, and the memorial fund will be dedicated to providing equipment and uniforms for Varsity Tennis in the upcoming years.\n “It’s still in the very early stages, but the short term goal [of the fund] is an immediate honoring of Mark with embroidered uniforms for the Boys Varsity A [tennis] team,” said Michael Kontaxis ’11, teammate and friend of Adamsson at Andover.\n Kontaxis helped coordinate the establishment of this fund, along with Peter Heidrich ’11, Adamsson’s Co-Captain on the tennis team, Trey Meyer ’09, former Captain of the tennis team and friend of Adamsson, Michael Kuta, Athletic Director, and some of Adamsson’s other former teammates.\n “[We] have been discussing possibilities at length to honor his memory, and this fund was decided upon in coordination with Coach Kuta and the administration as a solution to both immediate and long term goals,” said Kontaxis.\n Adamsson’s memorial fund will also have a long-term impact on the tennis team, as the money will also go towards improvements to the tennis facilities in both practical ways and ways commemorative of Adamsson’s time at Andover.\n Organizers of the fund hope that both the fund and its contributions can stand as lasting testaments to Adamsson’s legacy at Andover both as a tennis player and as a friend.\n “While Mark’s life may have been tragically cut short, we’re hoping that his contributions to Andover Tennis will live on through the players and facilities of years to come,” said Kontaxis.\n During his time at Andover, Adamsson was a fierce competitor on the tennis court, and he brought his team to many victories. Most prominently, Adamsson triumphed in the deciding match during the championships his Senior year, winning first place for himself and his team, according to Boys Varsity Tennis Coach Greg Wilkin.\n “It was magnificent,” Wilkin said of Adamsson’s victory during the championship game of the 2011 tennis finals. “Put Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack from Gladiator on in the back of your mind and imagine that. … Nobody who saw that match that day will ever forget it nor the obvious, indisputable fact that Mark had the heart of a lion.”\n Adamsson was also a great friend, a proctor, a Flagstaff GeograBee cluster finalist and winner of the “best-dressed” senior superlative among other achievements, according to Kontaxis. \n “I’d argue Mark got the ‘best-dressed’ superlative not merely for his sense of style, but for the way he carried himself… He was a hard worker and an intense competitor, had a wry sense of humor and, for those who knew him, a respectable amount of humility. I’ll always remember him for his distinct combination of poise and determination,” said Kontaxis.\n Heidrich said, “Mark was a very well-dressed, tall Swede. He was very helpful in my transition to Andover my junior year of high school and a well-respected athlete at Andover… and in class he was a great student and intellectual.”\n “He was a natural leader and instilled a great deal of confidence in the younger players with his dedication to practice and willingness to share advice with the [Juniors],” Heidrich continued.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nOn March 5, the College Board announced that the company’s current Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) will be reformatted for the spring of 2016. Similar to the ACT, the redesigned exam will include an optional essay and will not penalize for incorrect answers. Rather than testing students on obscure words, the vocabulary section will focus on relevant words that students are more likely to come across during their time at college. The goal of the newly formatted SAT is to make it more relevant to today’s students and to specifically target material covered in high school classrooms, according to Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling. “I think the main reason was to make the SAT ‘fairer’ and to make it more relevant to today’s kids. … They are taking out a lot of the gimmicky questions like vocabulary words that people rarely use and [making] it much more centered on critical thinking and reading skills,” said Logan. “The cynical reason [for the shift] would be that the ACT took over the SAT in terms of market share, so I think they were starting to lose market share, and they wanted to make themselves more relevant and a bigger presence,” he continued. Due to lack of substantial information regarding the content of the test, nothing has been planned so far by the College Counseling Office to respond to the new format, according to Logan. “The College Board has sort of rolled out their initial ‘hey, here’s what we’re doing,’ but I think the test will become much more tangible with more hard information on what’s going to be in it, etc. As of right now, I don’t think there’s much to do. … The short answer is: it is to be determined,” said Logan. Although the majority of Andover students in the class of 2014 took the SAT, over half of the class of 2014 took the ACT, often in addition to the SAT, according to Logan. Unlike the SAT, the ACT started out with an objective to test what the students were learning in classrooms. Although speculation suggests that the new format will be “easier,” Logan said that this may not necessarily be the case. “It will be testing students in a different way, in that it will be more geared towards what you are learning in class and how you are learning it,” he said. “It will be interesting to see what the new SAT ultimately looks like and how kids will perform on it,” he continued. College Board has announced that the new SAT will revert back to its original 1600 point scale and optional writing section. In 2005, the College Board changed the SAT to its current 2400 point scale with a required writing section. “[The writing section] will be a very different type of writing. For example, the old SAT writing didn’t have to be factually correct, as long as the evidence backed up your statement; however, that may not be the case anymore,” said Logan. Andover has not yet made specific action in response to the new change in the SAT, but just last year it has begun a partnership with a test prep company, “PrepWorks,” to provide students a high-quality test prep option that will prepare students for both the SAT and the ACT. Currently, the Senior and Upper classes have access to this online program, and the Lower class will have access to it within the month.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nAndover placed 11 out of 19 New England Boarding schools in the Green Cup Challenge by reducing its total energy expenditures by 2.2 percent. “[The percent reduction] is not a huge number, but it still shows that everybody is working hard to reduce their energy,” said Debra Shepard, Sustainability Coordinator. The winning school for the New England Boarding schools region, Avon Old Farms in Connecticut, had a 16.8 percent reduction in energy expenditures. The competition ran from January 15 to February 12, but there was a delay in tallying the official results until March. Andover participated in one of the nine regional competitions of the Green Cup Challenge. The entire national competition, which involves more than 300 schools around the country, judges schools after taking a baseline reading of normal energy expenditures prior to the competition, and comparing those readings with readings of energy expenditures taken during the competition. Andover also hosted a simultaneous inter-dorm energy challenge. Eaton Cottage won the challenge with a 34.7 percent reduction. Shepard says that her goal in participating in the competition is to build a community that lives off of energy savings and sustainability-minded behaviors. “The real challenge in terms of the culture of the campus is how do we maintain that momentum from the Green Cup? Green Cup is only four weeks and people do a lot of crazy things, but [we need] to get that energy and enthusiasm and stretch it out over the whole year,” Shepard said. To promote energy sustainability throughout campus, the office seeks to tie in environmental consciousness in everyday student life. “At orientation [students are asked] what it means to be sustainable at Andover, [and this consciousness prevails] all the way through major events, to dorm life, through walking through academic buildings,” Through renovations and structural changes, the Sustainability Office hopes to reduce Andover’s energy consumption through installing “greener” technologies to increase efficiency. The new Rebecca Sykes Wellness Center is slated to have Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification and geothermal heating, an environmentally conscious process that extracts heat from the ground. The ice rink is also planned to make use of solar power in the coming years. “[The point is] having the campus demonstrate and be a model for sustainability, but [also] it’s kind of infusing [a respect for the environment]: getting it, buying into it and using that information in [student’s] lives going forward,” said Shepard.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nHarboring anxious feelings and clutching prepared notes, Patrick Monaghan ’14, Rachel Murree ’14 and six other Andover students entered a courtroom at Lawrence Housing Court. They were there to fight a legal case against Carborite Aircraft Inc. for the death of John D. Jacob, who was performing a stunt in one of Carborite’s stunt planes. John D. Jacob, in truth, was a fictional character and Carborite a made-up company, but Andover’s Mock Trial team walked into the courtroom acting as Jacob’s lawyers, fighting for the Massachusetts Regional Mock Trial championship. On Wednesday, February 26, Monaghan and Murree, the Co-Presidents of Mock Trial, led members of Andover’s Mock Trial team to a victory against Andover High School (AHS) in the 29th annual Massachusetts State Bar Association High School Mock Trial Tournament. Andover’s team had passed three preliminary rounds in prior weeks but needed to beat AHS in a tiebreaker to be crowned regional champions. “It was such a relief when we found out we won, because at the end of a trial I’m never really sure which way it goes, and I always sort of brace myself for the worst. The judge will either leave the room or possibly sit at the bench and calculate scores. And so you’re sitting there waiting, trying to stay in character. When you win, there’s no cheering, just a sigh of relief. You always want to be a good sport about it to the other team because they’ve been working just as hard as you have,” said Murree. After winning the title of regional champions, Andover’s Mock Trial team moved onto a Sweet Sixteen round that could have sent them to a state championship. Unfortunately, the team lost their trial to Malden Catholic High School on March 6. Andover’s team was still satisfied with a regional victory, having been plagued in recent years with a lack of victories at the state competition, a small team and little adult advising. “It felt very much like [Patrick and I] were building the Mock Trial team from the bottom up. When we got the club, it was in bad shape. We were working with a fairly new team this year, not a lot of people. We both had experience with Mock Trial at a school before Andover, but a lot of the people we were training from scratch,” said Murree. According to Murree, most high school Mock Trial teams have an attorney coach who attends weekly practices and gives the students critiques and advice about what an actual lawyer would do in a court case. “The two of us were both attorney and teacher coach for a long time this year. And when we did find an attorney coach, [Scott Taylor], this year, unfortunately he had to leave to do some litigation work in Texas,” said Murree. Since winning their new title, Monaghan and Murree are focusing on preparing next year’s board and creating a foundation for future years of success. “We just turned over the board, and so [Patrick and I] will be working with the board to make sure that they’re in a good spot going into next year so they feel like they’re ready to take on the world because honestly they’re in an amazing spot. There are a lot of really strong Uppers who we know are going to lead the club really well next year,” said Murree. Mock Trial will spend the Spring Term preparing for and competing in a trial against Exeter’s Mock Trial team. They have also been awarded an Abbot Grant to attend a trial at Harvard University in the fall.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nOn March 10, 3,049 students nervously sat by their computer screens, constantly refreshing the Andover decision webpage in hopes of receiving an acceptance email from the Andover Admissions Office. 427 — or 14 percent — of these students received an invitation to join the 237th admitted class for the 2014-2015 school year. These 427 students were chosen from an applicant pool representing 33 states and 25 countries, according to Bill Leahy, Director of Admission. This year’s acceptance rate is a slight increase from last year’s historically-low 13 percent. “We are not interested in just driving up applications and driving down the admit rate in order to appear even more selective than we already are. Instead, our focus all fall during our interviewing season was to help families think about the best ‘academic and social fit’ so that they could develop an appropriate list of potential schools,” said Leahy in an email to The Phillipian. Leahy attributed 2013’s unusual admission rate to an enrollment management strategy designed to prevent over-enrollment. In 2012, Andover saw a record-breaking 84 percent matriculation rate, prompting the school to create additional housing options to accommodate a greater number of students. The high yield required renovations to Tucker House to add more rooms and three-room triples and one-room doubles to be formed around campus. $5,685,000 in financial aid was awarded by the Admission Office to this year’s admitted class. Approximately 47 percent of the student body is projected to be on financial aid in the 2014-2015 school year, with 13 percent on full scholarship, according to the Andover website. 51 percent of admitted students identified themselves as white. 24 percent identified as Asian, Asian American or Biracial Asian, and 16 percent identified as Native American, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino or Biracial, according to Andover’s Website.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nAccording to a March 11 press release, Andover has set the tuition for the 2014-2015 academic year. Determined during the Board of Trustees’ winter meeting, tuition for boarding students will be $48,850, and tuition for day students will be $38,000. Tuition for both boarding and day students increased 3.5 percent from the 2013-2014 academic year tuition, according to Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer. For the 2013-2014 academic year, tuition for boarding students was $47,200, and tuition for day students was $36,700. According to Carter, Andover’s tuition costs remains low in comparison to peer schools. “We are at the second lowest in our peer group. Exeter is the lowest,” said Carter. The costs of tuition at St. Paul’s School, Choate-Rosemary Hall, Hotchkiss School, Deerfield Academy and Northfield Mount Hermon School are all greater than that at Andover. Carter said that the increase in tuition was prompted by several factors. “You have to fund the financial aid budget, you have to fund salaries, you have to fund increases in the cost of services, like energy and things like that. [The tuition] is really balancing the budgetary priorities and other sources of income, and try to keep the increase [in tuition] as low as possible.” Ultimately, the tuition is determined by “how much costs are going up,” said Carter. The Senior Administrative Council made a recommendation for the new tuition to the Board of Trustees, who approve and set the tuition, said Carter.\n\n', 'Mar 27, 2014'), ('\nThe Office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) announced the five students selected for the 2014-2015 CAMD Scholar Program on February 27.

A new addition required another piece that outlined specific entities on campus that may be interested in involving themselves with the presentation or complementary programs that could go alongside, for example a panel discussion, a film or an expert in the relevant field.\n Students will start preliminary research in the spring with the help of their faculty advisors to hone down their topic and will continue researching this summer. In late July, they will turn in a rough draft of their research paper to their advisors and begin the editing stage that lasts through August. Then the students and their advisors will work together to create a presentation that the student will give during fall or winter term.\n DEVONTAE \n FREELAND\n Advisor: LaShonda Long, Instructor in English\n Freeland will be conducting a comparative study regarding the situations of African-Americans in the United States and gypsies in Spain in his project, “The Unwanteds: Comparing the Socio-Politics of African Americans and Spanish Gitanos in the Post-Civil Rights and Post-Franco Era.”\n “When you look at the Gitano community, you see an ethnic minority in a country that describes itself as a melting pot. Gitanos have been there in the country for about 500 to 600 years, yet are still underrepresented in politics, concentrated in urban areas, subject to gang violence, drugs,” said Freeland.\n In comparing the cultures, Freeland hopes to expose the student body to “the various systems and intricacies of the ethnicities of the Hispanics and African Americans,” he said, and hopes to tie in his presentation with either the Black Arts or Latin Arts Weekends next year.\n CARRIE \n INGERMAN \n Advisor: Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator\n Ingerman’s presentation, “Impact of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) on Secondary School Education,” will explore the implementation of IDEA in public and private schools, with a focus on Andover itself.\n Ingerman’s interest in the topic was spurred after meeting an autistic boy in second grade. In 2012, Ingerman had her own medical experience that left her disabled both physically and cognitively. Ingerman hopes to further expose students at Andover to disabilities. \n Ingerman said there are 50 students with disclosed chronic disabilities at Andover. “It’s estimated that there are roughly another 50, so that’s close to 9 percent, which is equal to the international student population,” said Ingerman.\n Ingerman is the Barbara Landis Chase CAMD Scholar for next year. One BLC Scholar is chosen each year by the selection committee to focus on race relations or human rights.\n THEA ROSSMAN\n Advisor: Christopher Jones, Instructor in History\n For her project, “A Race Apart: Discovering Whiteness in Appalachian America,” Rossman plans to compare what it means to be white in America and what it means to be white in the Appalachian America.\n Rossman has always been interested in race relations and race studies. “When you think about race, not a lot of people — I didn’t, definitely — think about whiteness, because white is often perceived to be the lack of race, or kind of the neutral against which everything else is prepared. Part of what I want to argue in my paper is that the white experience is actually very racialized,” she said.\n She hopes to educate students about the truth about the hidden “racialization” of whites, the effect of power and the ways we define “whiteness” on the lack of overt racism and compartmentalization.\n KAILASH \n SUNDARAM\n Advisor: Theodore Parker, Instructor in History\n Sundaram will research underrepresentation of Indian-Americans in the United States government for his project, “Wealth, Knowledge, But Little Power: An Examination of the Lack of Indian American Political Activism.”\n He realized his passion for his topic when he became interested in politics at the beginning of high school. “I realized that there were very few people who looked like me and who I could identify with,” he said. “I’m sure you’ve seen MetroPCs commercials where there is that nerdy Indian guy, and those contribute to the stereotype where you don’t see [Indians] as leaders, but more as the person who does your math homework for you.”\n Raising awareness and exposing stereotypes are the goals of his presentation. “Around 5 percent of our school is Indian-American, so the topic is really relevant to our community,” he said. \n JOYCE WANG\n Advisor: Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator\n In her project, “Unreachable Schools, Invisible Hope: An Examination of the Limited Educational Resources of Migrant Children in Mainland China,” Wang will research the situations of lower class families that live in China. \n “I noticed the huge inequalities in Chinese society. . In my own neighborhood in China, there are really rich people who live in luxurious apartments and houses and country clubs, and right next to them are slums,” said Wang. “There are not as many people in America who care about the issues of poverty in China. I think that’s my responsibility.”\n Wang hopes to show students the other side of China. “Recent years, China’s all [been] about the economic growth.

In addition to this initiative, Gutierrez and Somer are also looking to improve the club system.\nPerkins and Williams posed questions to the candidates during the debate. When answering a question concerning her and Gutierrez’s platform, Somer said that “clubs need to advertise much more effectively. Students should know all the clubs on campus before the Club Rally, because that’s a very overwhelming experience. That’s not a good opportunity for people to get familiar with the clubs available on campus.”\nIn their closing remarks, Gutierrez and Somer discussed one of the most emphasized items on their platform: mental health awareness. “We can’t ignore the fact that a number of students here at Andover are dealing with mental health issues. It needs to be addressed now,” said Gutierrez.\nGutierrez and Somer plan to work with Graham House and Isham to create a resource guide on PAnet where students could gather information on mental health. and according to their platform, they hope to provide students “with clear information on how to help yourself or a struggling friend.”\nIn addition to mental health, Gutierrez and Somer plan to increase community spirit through alteration of the orientation program and hope to increase student input in Student Council proceedings.\xa0\n“My strength I would definitely say is my passion, because I’ve really struggled here like many others and I really care about the student body,” said Somer during the debate.\xa0“I’m willing to go the extra mile and put in the effort,” added Gutierrez.\xa0\nPage and Vale’s ideas included using Out of the Blue as a text in the English department, developing an online video resource for students in chemistry and math classes, introducing a part-time sexual education program, removing an art requirement for new Lowers and supporting further sustainability efforts on campus.\nWilliams said, “[Clark and I] are incredibly excited to work with [Gutierrez and Somer] in the coming months before the assume the Co-Presidency in September 2014.

Mental Health Awareness_\nWe strongly believe this campus needs to open up the discussion on mental health. While many struggle with mental health issues themselves, most of us at least know someone dealing with them. This issue affects a large portion of our student population and has gone unaddressed for far too long. We want to host a school-wide forum or possibly make this next year’s school congress topic in order to connect students with faculty on this issue. We also want to do a poster awareness campaign and create a guide that outlines how to seek help for yourself or your friends.\n_II. Community Spirit & Bonding_\nWe have come up with concrete ways to improve orientation in order to make it a time for people to actually bond. While brainstorming realistic, simple ways to help day students have a place to go on campus, we thought that it was a no-brainer that they should be allowed to study with friends in dorms during study hours.\n_III. Bringing Your Ideas to the Table_\nWe’re all about hearing the improvements that make your days a little easier. This year, I (Rebecca) collaborated with Mrs. Kip to add the new healthier options to Fourth Meal. It’s these small details that we want to bring to Student Council. While meeting many of you, we have heard many new suggestions, such as adding a plate of cheese pizza to Paresky each day. It’s these realistic ideas that Student Council needs to focus on.\n* * *\n## Carter Page and Hanover Vale\nCarter Page ’15 and Hanover Vale ’15 began their campaign with a question: “What do you struggle with most at Andover?” The answers that students gave to these questions, Vale said, were ultimately what drove their platform.\n“People would respond with these very personal things that we didn’t usually think student government targeted at all,” said Page. In response, Page and Vale have tried to make their campaign about the personal. Their top priority is to integrate “Out of the Blue,” an anthology of student writing about race, class, gender, sexuality and ability, into Andover’s curriculum, according to Vale.\nThey hope also to make the Co-Presidency itself more personable in smaller ways.\n“At [All-School Meeting]s, instead of talking about Andover and invoking lots of the quotes of the constitutions. You know what, can we talk about how students are feeling?” said Page. “Once in a while throughout the school year, we hope to send out an email [saying], ‘Freshman fall, this is what I struggled with. The position is not the source of ideas, it’s more a representation of students.”\nPage and Vale are three-year Uppers from Glenview, IL, and Wilmington, MA, respectively.\n**Top 3 Proposals:**\n_I. Strengthening community and easing the transition to Phillips Academy via “Out of The Blue.”_\nWe intend to implement its use in Junior English classes during the Fall Term or a pseudo-“PACE” program for ninth graders and its incorporation within advisory groups for all other grades. We believe a more open community stems from discussion, and that “Out of The Blue” is the greatest form of student expression we have, as well as the perfect vehicle to base this discussion around.\n_II. Using Technology to Improve Education. Creating online videos specific to Phillips Academy in introductory science and math classes, similar to MITopencourseware._\nWe feel it is imperative to utilize the capability of our student body and having these videos as a work duty would satisfy the requirements of those who may have not been able to tutor as well as allow for students to strengthen their understanding of a certain subject.\n_III. Sustainability._\nRestricting hours of certain lights on campus in order to reduce light pollution and energy waste, encouraging the school to shy away from fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies and proposing the modification of old buildings on campus to make them more efficient.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2014'), ('\nAll of the ten initial Co-Presidential candidates created a Facebook page dedicated to their campaign, and the six pairs who made it through the first round of voting all created Facebook pages less than 24 hours after they were officially allowed to announce their candidacy on Monday at 12:01 a.m. These Facebook pages have filled quickly with photos of the candidates, drafts of platforms and statements of support from friends.\n“This campaign is really about making yourself a presence either on students’ computers or in their lives. On Facebook, it’s visual. You have to make sure that people see you and that you don’t suffocate them with text,” said Andrew Zheng ’15, who is running for Co-President with Kinsey Yost ’15.\nYost and Zheng have posted 12 campaign posters to their Facebook page throughout the 12-day campaign period, including a black and white “Academy of Cards” poster, playing on “House of Cards,” a popular Netflix television show.\nThe decision to restrict when pairs were allowed to publicly announce their candidacy was made in part because of the greater influence of social media in this campaigning season, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. In prior years, candidates were allowed to announce their intent to run on Facebook several weeks before the elections.\n“Some people were tempted to start campaigning in January, and that’s not what we want people to be thinking about. It makes the whole group, the whole candidate pool a little crazy,” Murphy said.\nDespite having less than a week to campaign before the first round of voting, candidates have taken advantage of social media to get their messages across. Corinne Singer ’15 and Juan Pablo Villarreal ’15 even made an account on Instagram, (@straightshooting).\n“I suppose it’s because I’m a photographer that one of the first things I considered in running is how are we going to appeal aesthetically, how are we going to advance in the eyes of the student body, if not through social media. We understood that immediately as one of the most essential ways and try to separate ourselves from the other candidate pairs,” said Singer.\nAside from advertising the visual component, candidates have also been using social media to actively spread their campaign platforms. Carter Page ’15 and Hanover Vale ’15 uploaded a six-page “unabridged platform,” complete with a title page to their Facebook page on Monday night via DropBox.\n“We’ve been using Facebook as a resource guide while we’re talking to people. While getting signatures, we can’t sit down and explain every single idea. So we give people the main idea and say, ‘Go to the Facebook page and see our thoughts fleshed out,” said Page.\nTessa Peterson ’15 who is running with Sina Golkari ’15 said, “[Facebook] is an integrated place where most everything about our campaign can be found and vocalized on our Facebook page. It really lets people see all of us in one spot.”\nPeterson and Golkari posted brief profiles on Facebook. “We did it with a little instagram flair and #mancrushmonday and #womancrushwednesday, just to sort of show people that we aren’t poster people. It’s a good way to get people to see that there are two humans behind our platform,” said Golkari.\nRebecca Somer ’15 and David Gutierrez ’15 have also used Facebook to publish additional information about themselves and promote their slogan: “Real Life. Real People.”\n“We have tons of faults and we’ve posted about them, our struggles, on our Facebook page and that’s what really sets us apart,” said Somer. “We want the student body to see that we’re just average student body members, struggles and all, who have a passion for helping our community,” wrote Somer in an email to _The Phillipian_.\nPerhaps because of the expanded presence of social media in this election season, some candidates, such as Arthur Doran ’15 and Antonia Leggett ’15 are finding greater value in simply talking to people.\n“The use of Facebook, that’s almost just a base level that everybody has. They have the page, they post their platforms on the Facebook page, they post their posters and some cute pictures of the pair,” said Leggett. “Being able to talk to people and going out of your way to speak to as many people as possible…. that’s the core of our campaigning. The Facebook is just a default.”\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2014'), ('\nStudents will enjoy two scheduled four-day weekends during the 2014-2015 school year, one during Fall Term and the other during Winter Term. The change was spurred by the positive feedback among both faculty and students after Head of School John Palfrey granted a four-day weekend this term with Head of School Day. Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, first brought up the idea to institutionalize additional four-day weekends at a Senior Administrative Council Meeting. “We just had a long-held feeling that we need breaks of substance along the way. When the administration created February Frees, it was a result of this feeling too,” wrote Murphy in an email to The Phillipian. “At the same time, I’m a little nervous that people will make too many plans [for the long weekends] and then arrive back to campus even more exhausted,” he continued. Fall Term’s Family Weekend will become a four-day Midfall Holiday next year, as classes will not be held on the Monday or Tuesday. The current Midwinter Holiday will also be extended to a four-day weekend. To compensate for the the extra day off during Winter Term, students will return a day earlier from Winter Vacation next year. No changes will be made to the Fall Term schedule. Murphy said that, while the Midfall Holiday will be a good opportunity for students to rest midway through the Fall Term, one of the main reasons the school decided to schedule a four-day weekend is to give students — especially Seniors — the opportunity to visit colleges and work on college applications. The additional day off next Winter Term will not replace Head of School Day, according to Murphy.\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2014'), ('\nEvery year, thousands of high-achieving students from low-income families in the United States are discouraged from applying to prestigious universities, and institutions of higher education in general, because of a lack of formal and effective college counseling, according to Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling, and Jim Ventre, Dean of Admissions. In collaboration with Khan Academy and the White House, Ventre and Logan are helping to produce a series of free college admission videos aimed to prepare students for the application process and the academic rigor of college. “Mr. Ventre and I are helping with the content of the videos — from where to start this college application process and where it is leading forward. We want to help students from low-income families to access the higher education system,” said Logan. The White House initially approached Khan Academy, who then reached out to Andover in December 2013 for aid in the effort. “Our country isn’t great [at] teaching how to do college counseling. So I think the videos will help guidance counselors by being a great teaching tool for them. I think it’s an opportunity to use some of the talents we have here at Andover and aid the broader good,” said Logan. One resource that many students tend to overlook is financial aid. Generally, higher-ranking universities have larger endowments and therefore have large amounts of aid to give to students. Yet these institutions are also normally more expensive, deterring many students from applying. “If a student is not aware of how different financial aid packages operate, he/she could potentially compromise himself/herself by selecting the school that is more familiar, just because it is easy, instead of going through the process and configuring the financial award that would make a higher institution more affordable,” said Ventre. The actual videos will be separated into two different sections: one portion of the video will feature both Logan and Ventre where they answer frequently asked questions that high-achieving students from low income families may have; the second will be a typical Khan Academy video with the trademark blackboard background, in which Logan and Ventre will compare the different financial aid packages that various colleges offer. Outsiders from various colleges and universities who are deans of admission and directors of financial aid will participate in the videos as well. The first set of videos will be released this summer.\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2014'), ('\nThe first round of voting for the 2014-2015 School Co-Presidential elections took place last Monday, with a record 85 percent participation from the student body.

The candidate pool will be narrowed to two pairs tonight.\n Unlike previous years, Junius Williams ’14 and Clark Perkins ’14, current Co-Presidents, released the voting percentages each candidate pair received in their email to the student body on Monday night. Each voter was able to vote for up to six pairs. \n Gutierrez and Somer received the most votes, as 68.3 percent of the 954 voters voted in support of the pair. 61.4 percent voted for Singer and Villarreal and for Golkari and Peterson, 59.3 percent for Yost and Zheng, 56.8 percent for Page and Vale and 53.8 percent for Doran and Leggett.\n “We found that in our past years of experience with elections, it would have been immensely helpful to know where we stood and to know the numbers. We found there have been lots of students who have been curious to know the numbers themselves, so we sought to present the hard numbers in the most legitimate fashion,” said Williams.\n The two female-female and two male-male pairs were eliminated after the first round of voting, and all six pairs that made it through to the second round consisted of one boy and one girl. Since the conception of the Co-President election model last year, more girls have put themselves forward, said Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. “We’ve had some years in the recent past where only two or three girls have run,” he said. \n The six candidate pairs participated in a debate hosted by Williams and Perkins past Wednesday. \n On March 26, the remaining two pairs will take part in a final forum at All-School Meeting. \n “It’s great to see so many pairs and so much diversity,” said Perkins.\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2014'), ('\nElection narrows to six candidate pairs.

A lot of the things that we’re focused on is making Andover a more personal community and helping us find the smaller communities within a bigger one,” said Leggett.\nRather than focusing on traditional “Christmas presents,” as Doran said, such as better food at Paresky Commons or added facilities, their campaign is about the long-term. “Promising material things to the student body – anyone can do that. Anyone can write an Abbot Grant. What we recognize is the power the [Co-Presidents] have in effecting kind of an intangible change, a shift in student culture,” said Doran.\nThey hope that “for years to come, people can focus more on their time here,” said Leggett.\nLeggett and Doran are three-year Uppers from Manchester, MA, and Natick, MA, respectively.\n* * *\n## Sina Golkari and Tessa Peterson\nWith a self-termed “holistic approach,” Sina Golkari ’15 and Tessa Peterson ’15 are hoping to “get to the root of the problems we see at Andover, rather than just sort of scraping the surface of them,” said Golkari.\nWith a combined two years of experience on Student Council, the duo believes it will be able to address broader concerns over student convenience, school unity and health with a platform that revolves around a set of very specific proposals.\n“Selfie sign-in” is one of their largest platform points.\n“As a Lower Rep, I discovered pretty quickly that change comes really slowly,” said Golkari. This is why, Peterson said, their goal this year will be to “lay the groundwork for those ideas… We hope to carry on ideas that have come from the past and continue to push those forward.”\nGolkari said, “To be able to leave a sort of tangible impact in the way we initially envisioned would possibly be the defining factor of our success.”\nGolkari and Peterson are three-year Uppers from Swampscott, MA, and Nederland, CO, respectively.\n* * *\n## David Gutierrez and Rebecca Somer\nCampaign ideas aside, David Gutierrez ’15 and Rebecca Somer ’15 believe that the most important role of the Co-President is to represent the average Andover student.\n“I haven’t seen any of the other candidates talking about their flaws at all,” said Somer. “Our slogan is ‘Real life, real people’ and that’s kind of what we’re going at… We are here to represent you guys and your problems.”\nSomer continued, “We are tired of seeing leaders come across as these perfect beings who are supposed to lead everyone because they’re so great… We have tons of faults. We’ve posted some of our struggles on our Facebook page.”\nWith this emphasis on representation, the duo believes it’s important that they “bring diversity to the table,” Gutierrez said.\nHe said, “Both of us come from two different friend groups, the things we are involved in. We both have very different backgrounds in all aspects. I think we really represent the campus pretty well, combined.”\nGutierrez and Somer are three-year Uppers from Hightstown, NJ, and Falls Church, VA, respectively.\n* * *\n## Carter Page and Hanover Vale\nCarter Page ’15 and Hanover Vale ’15 began their campaign with a question: “What do you struggle with most at Andover?” The answers that students gave to these questions, Vale said, were ultimately what drove their platform.\n“People would respond with these very personal things that we didn’t usually think student government targeted at all,” said Page.

It’s about how the organization functions itself. It’s an entity, and if that’s flawed, you won’t be able to be effective.”\nThe pair hopes to invite greater student participation in the political process by revamping the Student Council website to include a forum and platform for voting on ideas.\n“The most important part of our proposal is that it allows for student input,” said Villarreal. “Although we have our ideas that we would like to enact, we would like to start off the ideas by getting some input from the student body about what they actually want. If what they want and what we actually envision, we cannot pursue what we envision.”\nSinger is a three-year Upper from Lynnfield, MA. Villarreal is a new Upper from Monterrey, Mexico.\n* * *\n## Kinsey Yost and Andrew Zheng\nKinsey Yost ’15 and Andrew Zheng ’15 are all about the little things. Lawn games, a boombox in Paresky Commons, a newsletter from Student Council – this pair’s platform is centered on the feasible.\n“Small changes are feasible. You can get them done, and you can get them done quickly,” said Yost. “It’s just a way that we can help ensure that we are promising the students what we can actually give them.”\nTo that end, Yost and Zheng’s goal is to make the student experience more enjoyable at Andover. “We’re here to take things seriously, but not too seriously. We’re here to make sure people enjoy their experience, as cliché as that sounds. We’re here to be a fun presence so that people can come up and talk to us,” said Yost.\nZheng added, “We honestly don’t believe that our solutions will completely eradicate these problems on campus, but we do believe that they’ll set a precedent for further change. Our ideas are small, they’re not ingenious… we think they can make a big difference.”\nYost and Zheng are three-year Uppers from Lake Oswego, OR, and Naperville, IL, respectively.\n\n', 'Feb 27, 2014'), ('\nAll of the ten initial Co-Presidential candidates created a Facebook page dedicated to their campaign, and the six pairs who made it through the first round of voting all created Facebook pages less than 24 hours after they were officially allowed to announce their candidacy on Monday at 12:01 a.m. These Facebook pages have filled quickly with photos of the candidates, drafts of platforms and statements of support from friends.\n“This campaign is really about making yourself a presence either on students’ computers or in their lives.

Rethinking advising with a more personal selection process at the end of freshman year_\nThe new advisor selection program would match you with an academic advisor with a survey at the beginning of Lower year (or Upper/Senior/Post-Graduate year for new students) based on common academic and general subject interests.\n_II. Creation of an electronic textbook database to reduce costs and increase efficiency_\nThe electronic textbook database would be available to all students and would be accessible on laptops, tablets and smartphones. While the administration is currently considering requiring iPads for the Junior class in future years, we hope to capitalize upon this by making online textbooks available to all students. By doing this, students would no longer have to lug around heavy textbooks and shell out hundreds of dollars at the beginning of each term.\n_III. Helping students appreciate the campus, with more outdoor seating areas and outdoor classroom spaces_\nWe live on such a beautiful campus, and, though it is hard right now to think about the fall and spring days of lawning, we want to make the best use of those times with more outdoor chairs on the quads and additional seating circles for holding class outside.\n\xa0\n**Sina Golkari and Tessa Peterson:**\n_I. Selfie sign-in_\nOnline sign-in would be achievable using a sign-in app installed on tablets stationed in places of study and dormitories. Students would sign their names and mark the time on the device in a similar way to the current system. After the student signs, the application would take a photo of the student, so that a house counselor could verify the authenticity of the student’s sign-in. If such a system proves successful, it would be updated to work from student iPhones.\n_II. Host Dorm_\nLike international students have “host families,” day students would benefit from host dorms, with access to support resources such as common rooms, dorm munches and meetings and house counselor mentorship, among others. Host dorms would be assigned thoughtfully, just like new student housing, so that day students feel comfortable within their assigned dorm.\nIII. Student Health Website\n_III. Creating a student website_\nA student website will be created, compiling health resources (regarding sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress, eating disorders, depression etc.) into a local interface. The website would also give students access to online anonymous Q&A with Isham and Graham House, as well as archives of previously-asked questions. Such a website would open up campus to discussions on student health and let students know that many of their classmates grapple similar questions, thus helping to overcome the stigma around visiting Isham and Graham House.\n\xa0\n**David Gutierrez and Rebecca Somer:**\n_I. Mental Health Awareness_\nWe strongly believe this campus needs to open up the discussion on mental\nhealth. While many struggle with mental health issues themselves, most of us at least know someone dealing with them. This issue affects a large portion of our student population and has gone unaddressed for far too long. We want to host a school-wide forum\nor possibly make this next year’s school congress topic in order to connect students with faculty on this issue. We also want to do a poster awareness campaign and create a guide that outlines how to seek help for yourself or your friends.\n_II. Community Spirit & Bonding_\nWe have come up with concrete ways to improve orientation in order to make\nit a time for people to actually bond. While brainstorming realistic, simple ways to help day students have a place to go on campus, we thought that it was a no-brainer that they should be allowed to study with friends in dorms during study hours.\n_III. Bringing Your Ideas to the Table_\nWe’re all about hearing the improvements that make your days a little easier.\nThis year, I (Rebecca) collaborated with Mrs. Kip to add the new healthier options to Fourth Meal. It’s these small details that we want to bring to Student Council. While meeting many of you, we have heard many new suggestions, such as adding a plate of cheese\npizza to Paresky each day. It’s these realistic ideas that Student Council needs to focus on.\n\xa0\n**Carter Page and Hanover Vale:**\n_I. Strengthening community and easing the transition to Phillips Academy via “Out of The Blue.”_\nWe intend to implement its use in Junior English classes during the Fall Term or a pseudo-”PACE” program for ninth graders and its incorporation within advisory groups for all other grades. We believe a more open community stems from discussion, and that “Out of The Blue” is the greatest form of student expression we have, as well as the perfect vehicle to base this discussion around.\n_II. Using Technology to Improve Education. Creating online videos specific to Phillips Academy in introductory science and math classes, similar to MITopencourseware._\nWe feel it is imperative to utilize the capability of our student body and having these videos as a work duty would satisfy the requirements of those who may have not been able to tutor as well as allow for students to strengthen their understanding of a certain subject.\n_III. Sustainability._\nRestricting hours of certain lights on campus in order to reduce light pollution and energy waste, encouraging the school to shy away from fossil fuels and embrace alternative energies and proposing the modification of old buildings on campus to make them more efficient.\n\xa0\n**Corinne Singer and Juan Pablo Villarreal:**\n_I. Bringing Student Council to your screen and your proposals to the table_\nThrough the Student Council website, every student should have the ability to contribute to,\nread about and comment on initiatives taken by the members of Student Council. You should\nnot have to be on Student Council in order to participate in its affairs.\n_II. Using Online Resources_\nAny initiative pursued by the whole school carries more weight than one pursued by a\nfew. Revolutionizing Student Council by taking it online would allow students to demonstrate their interest in initiatives online, the collective voice of the student body will not be ignored. Let’s\nbuild the online bridge between the student body and Student Council.\n_III. Introducing Powerschool_\nProblem: Tired of vague midterms? Anxious about your progress in class?\nSolution: Welcome to “Powerschool,” a program that teachers use across the globe in order to post online live updates, comments, and grades on specific assignments. “Powerschool” constantly calculates and updates your term average, abolishing grade ambiguity.\n\xa0\n**Kinsey Yost and Andrew Zheng:**\n_I. Student Council Transparency_\nIt’s the age-old question: What does Student Council do? To be honest, we are not entirely sure. The student body deserves to be aware of its representatives’ actions and how effective Student Council can actually be as an instrument for reform. To address this grand issue, we first propose a simple monthly printed newsletter that would be distributed to the student body and inform students of the progress Student Council is making.\n_II. Day Student Integration and Cluster Munches_\nAlthough day students make up over 25 percent of Andover’s population, we do not do as good a job as we should of integrating day students into the community. One way we can help to facilitate this connection is by making cluster munches earlier so it’s easier for day students to attend. Through cluster munches, we meet new people and bond over our shared love of free food, but this privilege may conflict with the unique schedules of day students. Earlier cluster munches are one simple way we can begin to tackle a much bigger problem.\n_III. Online Sign-In_\nWe hope to implement a new system of sign-in that would not require us to toil to and from our dorms everyday. As two people who have both lived in remote Abbot dorms, we know first hand that the walk can be quite intimidating and exasperating. iPads could be put in places of study (Gelb, Morse, library etc.), allowing students to sign in and out digitally by signing their name with a stylus. With software being tentatively developed, these signatures would be able to be recorded, logged and viewed by the student’s house counselors.\n\n', 'Feb 24, 2014'), ('\nThe international sensation PSY and his 2012 record-breaking single “Gangnam Style” was many people’s first introduction to the world of Korean Pop Culture (K-Pop). This singular figure has created a very specific image of K-Pop—an image that Jackie Kim ’14 believes does not truly reflect the nature of the musical genre. Kim, a native of South Korea, sought to examine the origins of K-Pop and how modern stereotypes and misconceptions on the genre have contributed to what it is and how it is perceived today in her Global Scholars presentation: “Cultural Technology: Examining the Transnational Advance of Korean Pop Culture.” “I think people have a lot of certain stereotypes about K-Pop, so I wanted to expand that to see the development, where K-Pop originated and where it is going currently… I wanted to expose people to the behind the scenes of K-Pop-making, as well as the spread of it and the globalization of it,” said Kim. The music genre of K-Pop set roots in South Korea after the Korean War in 1953. Because American troops stayed in Korea after the war for protection, American products and culture, including the music industry, began to spread across Korea. K-Pop emerged from the cross between American and Korean culture, according to Kim. In the 1990s K-Pop saw a major turning point with the group Seo Taiji and the Boys, who incorporated American popular music styles like rap into their music, and became very popular to teens, starting a trend of music groups across the country. Though these were not the first K-Pop groups, they were incredibly successful. They became known as “Idol Groups,” because teens would idolize the group members, said Kim. K-Pop soon began to spread, so much that the Chinese gave it the term “Hallyu,” or means Korean Wave, because it was becoming so popular in China and Southeast Asia, said Kim. The K-Pop movement faced opposition and ridicule, however, even being voted one of the “Top 10 Most Embarrassing Trends in the Nation” in Vietnam. “I have always been really interested in music, I am part of the orchestra here as well, and I really enjoy listening to K-Pop. And as an International Club board member, I really enjoy multiculturalism as well as music, so combining both, I thought, would be a really cool idea,” Kim said.

A white clerk saw Williams and his brother at the “white” fountain, and their need for a sip of water escalated into a heated argument between the clerk and Williams’ mother. \n “My mother won the argument because the messenger of white superiority was no match for her rage, her facility with language and her protective spirit. We were both impressed, and we left the store laughing with our heads held high. Now, those individual acts of resistance were what eventually started the civil rights movement,” said Williams in the presentation. \n In Richmond, Virginia, where Williams grew up, having separate facilities for Caucasian and “colored” people was the norm. Williams, the keynote speaker for African Latino American Society’s (Af-Lat-Am) annual Black Arts Weekend, spoke of participating in segregation resistance efforts during his childhood and adolescence in his presentation on Friday. \n Williams immersed himself in the civil rights movement with the help of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Montgomery, Alabama. An SNCC protest on the streets resulted in William’s arrest, along with hundreds of others. In the jail cells, there were only mattresses—no sheets or blankets.\n When it got cold, Williams said, the guards brought some blankets, but not enough for everybody in the cell. Williams watched men grab the blankets in a flurry of hands and dust, but he did not get one. Another cellmate who worked with the SNCC, Worth Long, got the attention of all of the cellmates.\n “He said, ‘I don’t know about you, but if I was a man, I wouldn’t take a blanket for myself unless there was a blanket for everybody,’” Williams said. Long’s ideals shaped Williams’ outlook on resistance for the rest of his life.\n “I can’t be satisfied with the blanket I have when other people don’t have that same blanket. People ask me, well, why do you fight so hard for public school in Newark when your children go to private school. I say, well, that’s fine, and I’m happy that Junius [Williams, Jr. ’14] has an educational blanket here at Andover, but I can’t be comfortable unless everybody else’s child has a blanket just as good,” he said.\n Williams attended Amherst College in Amherst, Mass., where he was one of four students of color in his grade. At Amherst, Williams was known for his constant smile. \n “The smile was both my offense and my defense. I didn’t realize it at the time, but every day I was running parallel to the development of the Civil Rights Movement, then full blown in the south. I was employing the strategy of Gandhi without knowing it by wearing them down with my capacity to suffer. I wanted to show them that I was a good guy, a fun guy to be around and just like them in every way,” said Williams. “I ignored a lot of things in order to get along and gain some friends, and that’s how I became the exception. Being the exception was all that we could hope for in those days,” he added.\n As his grades improved, Williams saw literature and psychology as applicable tools to the Civil Rights Movement. He majored in political science. \n “Power fascinated me, maybe because of what I was beginning to see in the civil rights movement,” said Williams. “Power is a function of people, money and position… If you’ve got money, you’re at the top. Then in the middle, you’ve got the people in the government positions… finally, you have the people at the bottom, but as all things part of the natural order, that may not be so bad. If the bottom crumbles, all the rest of it does.”\n Using his understanding of power, Williams caused social change by protesting against the construction of a highway in Newark that would have wiped out part of the black community.\n “It’s important for young people to understand these lessons about power so that when they get into positions and they can take charge, they will understand it,” said Williams. \n In addition to Williams’s keynote speech, Black Arts Weekend featured a talent showcase on Saturday night, a Black Arts Regional Dance and a worship service with the Andover Gospel Choir.\n\n', 'Feb 20, 2014'), ('\nAfter a national search that lasted for several months and yielded over 150 candidates, Thomas Lockerby, current Vice President for Development at Boston College, was selected to become the new Secretary of the Academy, and will begin his tenure at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.\n Lockerby will replace Peter Ramsey as the Head of the Office of Academy Resources (OAR). Ramsey is in the midst of his 17th year as Secretary of the Academy and will step down to join the OAR as the Senior Philanthropic Officer.\n “This represents a major change and opportunity for the Academy for the next ten to 15 years in the work of alumni and parent engagement and philanthropy that we do for the school,” said Ramsey.\n As the Secretary of the Academy, Lockerby will oversee fund-raising for the school. He will also manage all communications with alumni and parents of the Andover community. “It’s a job with many parts, all designed to work with people who want to become better connected and support the Academy in a greater way,” said Lockerby.\n Lockerby graduated from Harvard after attending a local public high school in Vermont, where he grew up. He entered the field of institutional advancement around 20 years ago and has worked at both Harvard as Director of Development Relations and at Dartmouth as Director of Gift Planning.\n For the past ten years at Boston College, Lockerby has overseen the $1.5 billion Light the World campaign.\n “I think that it’s really my work experiences and my passions for philanthropy and how it affects schools and helps them to be stronger that has really prepared me well for this next job,” said Lockerby.\n The search process to find a new Secretary of the Academy began several months ago when the OAR team met with the Isaacson, Miller Search Firm to discuss the position. The search committee and Isaacson, Miller worked together to narrow down the applicants to three finalists, according to Tracy Sweet, Director of Communications. \n “The quality of the pool of candidates was impressive, the process inclusive and thorough, and the outcome excellent,” said Thomas Hodgson, Instructor in Philosophy and Religion and a member of the search team for the new secretary.\n After the OAR team met with the candidates, reviewed their qualifications for the position and gave their feedback to both Head of School John Palfrey and the search team, Lockerby was selected for the position.\n “[Lockerby] stood out among an exceptional group of candidates for the position of secretary of the Academy. … [Lockerby]’s record as an outstanding fundraiser, skilled manager and team leader, coupled with his success representing a top tier university with deeply loyal alumni, will serve Andover extremely well,” said Palfrey in an Andover press release.\n “I’ve had the pleasure of knowing [Lockerby] and admiring his work for a number of years now. I’m very excited about his appointment, and I think that we can all look forward to seeing the Office of Academy Resources and our support for volunteers going to the next level in support of the Academy and in support of our students and families and faculty,” said Ramsey.\n Lockerby said he is looking forward to coming to Andover this summer. \n “As I got to know faculty and I met some students in my day at campus, I was really attracted by the feeling at Andover and how important the community was to all of the faculty, students and administrators that I met,” said Lockerby.\n Lockerby will arrive on campus in June to begin his term as Secretary of the Academy during the final phase of the strategic planning process. Despite being unable to shape the beginning of the process, Lockerby will play an instrumental role in communicating the strategic plan off campus, primarily as it affects alumni and parents. \n “I’m arriving later to the [strategic planning] process, but I hope that I’ll be very much involved in it as it moves forward.” said Lockerby.\n In addition to helping further the strategic planning process, Lockerby hopes to quickly get to know many of the people whom he will be working with in the coming years.\n “My immediate goal when I arrive on campus is to get to know my team in the Office of Academy Resources… Then, my second priority is to get to know the campus community by meeting and developing relationships with faculty and other senior administrators,” said Lockerby.\n\n', 'Feb 20, 2014'), ('\nLast Wednesday, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) released its new revitalized website in order to provide researchers with more organized information and resources. The OWHL webpage primarily serves to aid current students in finding resources and to provide information to prospective families. In attempting to fulfill these roles, the old website was cluttered with information and was difficult for students to use to find guidance, according to Elizabeth Tully, Director of the OWHL. “In essence, the website is the face of the library, electronically, so we’d like to have it be clean and streamlined and to be less chaotic and easier to navigate,” said Beth Tompkins, Head of Technical Services at the OWHL. In order to help organize its resources, information is now categorized under five tabs titled: “About the Library,” “Programs and Services,” “What’s New,” “Research” and “Ask a Librarian,” all of which are designed to make the website as practical and immediately useful as possible. In particular, these tabs have helped make OWHL Guides, a popular research tool that consolidates resources by topic onto one page, more accessible. Previously, the Guides were buried behind multiple pages and links on the website. “I think [putting the Guides under the ‘Research’ tab] will end a lot of frustration that students have had with our website before. The OWHL Guides are front and center since we know that’s what a lot of students use, and that’s what we designed them for,” said Liza Oldham, Instructional Librarian at the OWHL. “Even for prospective families and some of our current teachers, they want to explore a little bit and see what the library has to offer, so we wanted to make that as clean and clear as possible by organizing with these tabs,” she continued. The new webpage runs on WordPress, a blogging platform. Using WordPress, OWHL faculty can now easily post updates on the page to notify the community if the library must close early or if a new book collection becomes available. “Even updating the staff list was tricky [on the old website], and we couldn’t just log in and do it. It wasn’t as fast and easy and simple,” said Emily Tordo, Assistant Archivist at the OWHL.\n\n', 'Feb 20, 2014'), ('\n“Let’s take a test,” said Alex Westfall ’15 to her audience in Kemper Auditorium on Monday. “How many of these seven famous quotes from comedy movies do you recognize?” \n Of the seven quotes, four were from modern male comedians, and the rest from their female counterparts. The general consensus of the room: only a handful of audience members could confidently say that they recalled the three female quotes. \n With this exercise, Westfall asserted that female comedians do not have the same presence as males in the same profession. Yet despite this disadvantage, women have made extraordinary bounds in comedy. Seeking to examine the identity of female comedians in the eyes of the American public in the past and what steps these women took to procure the image they have today, Westfall shared her research during her Brace Fellow Presentation “‘Fire the Girls!’: The Female Pioneers of Modern American Comedy.” \n Westfall focused her presentation on Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers and Mary Tyler Moore: two female comedians who earned their fame through situational comedy television and two who became successful through live stand-up comedy performances. \n Each comedian contributed in her own way to change the public perception of female comedians, said Westfall. Ball subjected herself to self-deprecating humor on the classic 1950s sitcom “I Love Lucy.”\n “[Ball] was willing to take the pie, to act as the fool, yet she stayed completely feminine like the stereotypes she was held to. She was not threatening to women, because she was not sexy, but had just the right amount of attractiveness,” said Westfall.\n “Lucy’s hilarious mishaps were what all real housewives of America wanted to do, they wanted to get out of the kitchen and the laundry room. She struck this nerve of frustration among American women which made her a television heroine,” she added.\n In contrast to Ball, Moore became the first professional, single, independent woman who supported herself in the comedy industry.\n “In a very quiet way, [Moore] made a statement about the women’s movement and the fact that women are more than housewives and mothers and nurses and they can do anything a man can do,” said Westfall.\n Rivers made her impact on the comedic profession in a completely different way, as she stormed the comedic scene with her profanity and excessive cursing, actions that were unexpected of women during her time in the 1980s.\n “[Rivers] absolutely caught the attention of her audiences by being incredibly quick and witty. She would make jokes about woman’s areas in her spiels, things like: giving birth, jewelry, husbands, etc…. It was really all around talked taboo subjects,” said Westfall.\n “This was groundbreaking—in the beginning, it was not normal for a woman to be talking about these kinds of things. Joan was sort of a contradiction within herself, wearing beautiful long gowns and expensive jewelry while maintaining an entire routine full of cusses and toilet humor,” she continued.\n Diller became excessively famous for becoming first female stand-up comedian to become successful without exclusively cursing or being profane, according to Westfall. \n “She was sexually repellent. Diller would engage in a more literal method of self-deprecation compared to Lucille Ball—literally making fun of herself, wear baggy, unflattering dresses on stage and would joke about her lack of sex appeal,” said Westfall.\n “Diller saw hostility mainly from males, because it seemed like she may have been smarter or wittier than them. She said that ‘women laugh quicker than men. It takes lot more to make men laugh. When the men realized I was a normal human being, they became fans,’” Westfall continued. \n Westfall’s upbringing inspired her to research this topic.

And that women usually starred in drama oriented shows. In addition, I can probably name four Filipino stand-up comedians off the top of my head, all of which are male,” said Westfall.\n Additionally, Westfall attributes her yearly visits to the Nantucket Film Festival and the comedy roundtable to her interest in the growth of female comedians.

The specific numbers of applicants to Niswarth, however, is confidential.\n “This certainly is only a one-year type of phenomenon, I don’t think this is a trend because traditionally, we’ve had a lot of applicants. I want to add, however, that the people that we chose for Niswarth this year, we’re so thrilled with this group that’s going. And that the lower numbers of applications don’t reflect the quality of people who applied,” said Mundra. \n As a result of the common application, Merrill said that some programs might not have been as exposed or well-advertised to the student body as they have been in the past. There may have been the possibility that some programs will not have as much visibility as they did in the past. \n While Merrill does not think that the drop in the number of applicants is detrimental to any of the programs themselves, he hopes that more students will apply in the following years. “One reason is that because not everyone who applies is well-suited to a particular program. It’s important to have the latitude to choose participants who match the design of the program,“ wrote Merrill in an email to The Phillipian.\n Despite the decrease in number of applicants, the common application will most likely be in place in the following years as well. “It’ll make it easier for us to keep track of who’s participating in what program…because it’s centralized, it’ll be easier to manage the financial aid aspects of it. Once everybody gets used to it, it’ll also be easier for students to keep track of what their options are,” said Merrill. \n GPG is a multidisciplinary faculty group created in 2006 with a mission of looking beyond Andover and making progress in global education.

Abbot was extremely important to me and Andover became so after the schools merged. And it is an irresistible opportunity to work with John Palfrey, whom I admire enormously,” said Rogers. As the new Charter Trustee, Rogers hopes to “contribute the professional experience [she has] had in education working at the university level and also [her] passion for education in general and Andover in particular.” There are 17 Charter Trustees and six Alumni Trustees on the Phillips Academy board. Rogers will fill the seat which became vacant upon the retirement of Mollie Lasater AA ’56. According to Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, one of the responsibilities of the Charter Trustees is to select members of the Board. Charter Trustees are typically the chairs of various committees within the Board of Trustees because they usually remain with the Board the longest, according to a previous article from The Phillipian. Charter Trustees have terms of six years, though it is common for Charter Trustees to be re-elected and serve a total of 12 years, according to a previous article from The Phillipian. Rogers was a two-year day student at Abbot Academy, where she appreciated the rigorous educational system of the institution and the many opportunities that it provided her. “I loved Abbot. My earlier school experience was in the public school system of Lowell, [Mass.], where I had some wonderfully dedicated teachers. But Abbot had small classes and a lot of personal attention,” said Rogers. “I was encouraged at Abbot to aim high in applying to college, which meant a lot as my parents had not gone to college. I have the best parents in the world, but they couldn’t really advise on how to think about college,” continued Rogers. “And of course, Abbot broadened my horizons as I met girls from many regions and backgrounds.” “I love education. I was in Harvard Admissions for many years, and I am particularly excited about working [for] an extraordinary educational institution at the secondary level. It is intellectually fascinating and emotionally gratifying,” she continued. Since graduating from Abbot Academy in 1970, Rogers’s dedication to both Abbot and Andover has only grown over the years. The merger of Abbot and Phillips in 1973 has strengthened her enthusiasm for her high school alma mater. She became a volunteer after the merger, when Andover reached out to her. “As a volunteer, I worked closely with Barbara Chase, the wonderful previous Head of School, and also with faculty leadership around the Abbot Academy Association and the [Institute for Recruitment of Teachers]. It was a great experience,” said Rogers. Rogers served as a board member and the President of the Abbot Academy Association and also as President of the Alumni Council, at which she also served as an alumni trustee. Rogers began her career in admissions at Harvard College, serving as Director for International Admissions.

Sidney R. Knafel ’48, the Chairman of the Addison Board of Governors, and Michael Schmertzier ’70, the Chair of the Addison Development Committee, both made gifts in support of the campaign, in addition to reaching out to others for support. \n “As the Chair of the Board of Governors, I think that I sort of took over the role as the Chair of the campaign effort. I made the plea for the Addison at the Board level. There was wonderful support and a growth of knowledge about the Addison and an interest in what it was doing. We ended up getting support from a number of the Trustees,” said Knafel. \n Most of the donations came from Andover alumni. Other donations came from foundations and parents of students. People without an affiliation with the school also donated to support the Addison Gallery. \n Using funds from the campaign, numerous renovations and updates were made from 2008 to 2011 to the Addison beginning in an effort to maximize space. \n “When people walk into the Addison now, it doesn’t look that different from what it used to look like. A lot of the changes were sort of behind the scenes, but they were very important. We have a much better security system, better climate control, better lighting. All of the systems have been upgraded,” said Susannah Abbott, Director of Development at the Addison. \n The library was expanded to hold all of the Addison’s collection of books, which was previously too large for the museum to store alone. Staff offices that once took up space in one of the galleries were moved, and a stairway that once connected the gallery to the Elson Art Center was taken out to restore the configuration of the gallery. With the increase of storage space following the renovations, the entirety of the Addison’s collection was able to be stored on site.\n “I think the Addison has become a more welcoming place for students. I know that the Museum Learning Center is a very popular place to study. It makes us incredibly happy to see students using the space that way, and just knowing that, for a lot of them, it’s just a haven,” said Abbott.\n Abbott said that, following the campaign, she has seen an increase in students and Andover residents visiting the gallery for the openings in the Fall, Winter and Spring Terms.\n Knafel said, “I think that now, [Andover] feels that it has benefitted and understands how it has benefitted from the Addison, and the Addison and its staff and supporters recognize how it is been supported and benefitted by [Andover].”\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nBoarders will now have a wider variety of healthy foods to order for “Fourth Meal” or school-provided snacks. With a new initiative started by Agatha Kip, School Nutritionist, in collaboration with Paresky Commons and the Dean of Students, apples, granola, yogurt and celery sticks will be available for Fourth Meal. “Because the Power Bar has been so very well received, we wanted to create a repertoire of ‘power snacks’ which dorm students could have at night at no cost,” said Kip. Fourth Meal is ordered by students in dorms for free from Commons. The new items will be added to the current fourth meal menu, which currently includes chips, pretzels, popcorn and NutriGrain bars. After sending a school-wide survey about new Fourth Meal options, Kip, Paresky Commons and the Dean of Students decided on the final additions to Fourth Meal menu. “Students, including some prefects and proctors, were also crucial to this effort, since their ideas and input gave us a student voice as we worked to create the new options…” Kip said. “[The] effort was a true collaboration, and we all eagerly await feedback from [students] all so we can determine if we have a success. We are hoping that [students’] studying is fueled more powerfully, which, in turn, will give [students] a healthier eating environment and a sense of being well-energized when doing homework,” she added. The new Fourth Meal is part of Kip’s efforts to create more energizing and healthy foods for students to help campus nutrition overall. “As with the power bar, some of the new snacks are more nutrient-dense so the calories are not ‘empty’ but ‘nutrient-filled,’” said Kip. These nutrients allow students to work while remaining motivated.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nAdham Moustafa ’14 was crowned Andover’s 19th annual GeograBee champion on Tuesday in Upper Right of Paresky Commons by Peter Drench, Instructor in History. The GeograBee is an annual, school-wide competition encompassing geography, culture and current events. The competition began at a dorm level, where all students answered questions to the best of their ability. Questions are asked until the number of students dwindles down to either one, two or three in each dorm, depending on the size of the dorm. The dorm winners then competed against each other at the cluster level, further paring down the contenders to a single cluster winner. A day student contest was also conducted and produced a day student representative. Moustafa of West Quad North Cluster, Jongho Park ’16 of Flagstaff Cluster, Tucker Drew ’17 of Abbot Cluster, Harry Wright ’14 of Pine Knoll Cluster, Miguel Wise ’14 of West Quad South Cluster, and David Shamritsky ’17, the day student representative, were the winners of their respective pools and all participated in the finals. The format of the finals evolved into a Quiz-Bowl style contest, with the contestants buzzing in before saying their answers aloud. The student who answered the most number of questions correctly won the Geograbee. Moustafa said he has always been fascinated by maps and mapmaking and his grandparents are both geographers. Moustafa has previously participated in similar competitions that tested more general knowledge including geography and culture. Last year, Moustafa advanced to the cluster finals of the Bee. “I was surprised. I was up against really tough competitors and I never thought I’d win at all. It all came close in the end and it was only a few points between me and the next competitor,” said Moustafa. Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator and organizer of the GeograBee, was in charge of finding questions for the contest. “I [find] a lot of the questions on the National Geographic site. There is a section on top [of the GeograBee page] that says ‘take the quiz,’ and every day they throw out ten questions, so if you go through that for a couple of months, you’re good to go,” she said. She also visits About.com for material to use. In order to incentivize students to participate in the competition, dorms that achieved 100 percent participation and a 50 percent average on the first ten questions will receive a pizza munch during Spring Term. The first place winner of the finals is awarded $100, second place $50 and third place $25. This year, Torabi has seen a dramatic increase in day student participation, and overall better scores among the students. She also has noticed that international students empirically fared quite well. She attributes the trend to the number of so-called “third-culture kids” in that group—students who live outside of their parents’ cultures, but have an understanding of their heritage, providing them with a more developed world view. Torabi noticed that there were no females who made it to the final round of the Geograbee, though she is unsure of the cause of the gender imbalance.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nElly Nyamwaya, Instructor in English, will teach a new English elective this Spring Term called “African Identities in American Literature.” As part of the new course, students will have the opportunity to break down cultural barriers through discussion about African and American culture in literature and cinematography. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Nyamwaya moved to the United States in 2007 and began teaching at Andover that same year. “There’s a saying that goes, ‘If you don’t tell your story, someone else will,’ and when that other person tells your story, you can’t truly blame him or her if he distorts what your story should really represent, so you should be the one to tell your story, and others should take guidance from you. That’s what inspired me to start the course,” said Nyamwaya. In particular, Nyamwaya hopes to draw from his own experiences as an African in America to further conversation and dialogue in the classroom. Nyamwaya said the course will bridge the gap between studying American and African cultures. “We’ve had courses [at Andover] in Asian literature, South American literature and various forms of American or European literature. I felt like there is space for the introduction of a course that brings in something about Africa,” said Nyamwaya. In addition to gaining a better understanding of African literature, Nyamwaya hopes that students will learn to break down conventional ideas and false impressions that they may have about African culture. “What I’m looking forward to most is to introduce students here to the beauty of African literature and the beauty of the culture that that literature represents, because there are many stereotypes about Africa and many misconceptions about what Africa is… I hope to provide a more objective, truthful picture of Africa through that course,” said Nyamwaya. Nyamwaya’s goals for the course stretch beyond the students’ being able to learn about African and American cultures. He hopes each student will have a chance for introspection about his or her own identity and character. “I’m also hoping that the course will enable [students] to be better world citizens because I know there are quite a number of students here that have an international orientation. They don’t define themselves purely as Americans or as Asians or as Europeans. Their visualization of who they are is global by definition. By teaching them African literature, I will be introducing them to a world that they should also know about,” he added. The course will feature a mix of American and African texts and films, selected by Nyamwaya for their strong representations of African characters. Among the books written by American authors are “Dreams from My Father” by Barack Obama and “A Raisin in the Sun” by Lorraine Hansberry. Nyamwaya, “There are so many literary works that have been written by Americans that feature African characters, and so I wanted to see how those African characters are portrayed, and how, by extension, their portrayal influenced the way Africans are perceived in the American public.” Nyamwaya also plans to examine the way Americans are represented in an African setting. The selections from African authors include works like “The Dilemma of a Ghost” by Ama Ata Aidoo and “A Man of the People” by Chinua Achebe. “I’d like us to look at how American characters [are featured] in African literature and how America is perceived through the portrayal of those characters in those texts,” said Nyamwaya. The course, although centered around African and American literature, will rest heavily upon discussion and discourse between the students. “We’ll be engaging in the Socratic method of instruction where I will be holding a lot of discussion using the Harkness table. The course will be entirely dependent on what the students bring to the table,” said Nyamwaya. “Through the discourse, through those discussions, I know that I’m going to learn a lot from my students. Even now, in the courses that I teach, there’s a lot that I learn from my students. That kind of eliminates my own perspective and makes me become a better instructor,” Nyamwaya added.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nSifting through piles and piles of newspapers from Lebanon and Cote d’Ivoire, Junius Williams ’14 spent his Senior Fall trying to piece together the story of Lebanese immigrants to Cote d’Ivoire to understand the impact of this specific group of people on the politics and economics of Cote d’Ivoire. \n Williams shared his findings with the Andover community through his Abbot Independent Scholars project on Wednesday. Many Lebanese people left Lebanon during a civil war in the 1970s and sought refuge in Cote d’Ivoire. The Lebanese now control about 60 percent of the country’s real estate sector, 80 percent of the distribution network and 40 percent of the industrial sector, according to Williams. \n “When you think of Lebanon and Cote d’Ivoire, you don’t think of two populations that actually have a very long, intertwined history, stretching back over a century. [I wanted] to show how interconnected we are,” said Williams in an interview with The Phillipian. \n “It’s especially applicable in a place like the United States, where at our root, we are a nation of immigrants, we are a nation of movement, we are a nation of transporting ideals, importing memories, but also basing our power structures off of movements and identities. So this is a case study of something much larger, something that I hope I can impress upon the people who attend the presentation,” he continued. \n Although Williams has always been interested in immigration as a first generation American, he came across the idea of studying the Lebanese population in Cote d’Ivoire only by chance. \n “The topic was something that I knew nothing about. It actually started with Wikipedia, and when one search led to another, I found that there were Lebanese in West Africa, which made me think largely to migration, and think about the idea of human movement since the 20th century,” said Williams in an interview with The Phillipian. \n To compensate for the lack of scientific, professional research done on the topic, Williams found innovative ways to find information for his project. \n “There is a lot of discussion about how the Lebanese came to Cote d’Ivoire in the 1920s, but the ‘so what’ after that was missing. That said, my process was compiling a lot of different kinds of sources. I looked at newspapers, I looked at a lot of social media. For example, although Facebook statuses [are]not exactly as scholarly sources, it gave me context. I looked at the home pages of Lebanese religious organizations, currently based in Cote d’Ivoire. Very nontraditional at times, but it worked out,” said Williams. \n Christopher Shaw, Instructor and Chair in History and Social Science, and Emmanuel Odjo, Instructor in French, were the advisors for Williams’s project. \n “Dr. Odjo is from Cote d’Ivoire, so naturally he had a lot of first hand experience. He gave some personal opinions and also knew where to find sources. Dr. Shaw is a scholar in African studies, so he directed me [to] the right sources,” said Williams. \n Odjo said, “[Junius’s topic] is compelling because it is a story about human beings, people who move somewhere, from a place to another place, to feel safe or better their lives or simply to have a new experience.”\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nOn Tuesday night, Kemper Auditorium was filled with students, faculty and residents of the town of Andover all seeking to hear renowned author and journalist Anita Diamant speak of her experience as a prominent writer of Jewish literature. Diamant, author of Jewish fiction and non-fiction novels, was brought to campus by the Jewish Student Union (JSU) to speak about the writing process of one of her bestselling novels, “The Red Tent.” Diamant’s novel is based off of Chapter 34 in the Book of Genesis, one of the more controversial stories of the Old Testament. Diamant presents a broadened and narrativized version of this story through the perspective of Dinah, offering a female point of view that is unique to the male-centric Bible. “[Author Thomas Mann said that] ‘[Dinah] was an insignificant thing, very yielding, without judgment or power or resistance.’ And that actually reflects her treatment in the Bible, pretty much. But that’s not a story that I wanted to tell. I wanted to tell the kind of story that keeps you turning the page, and that kind of a character would certainly not keep you turning the page,” said Diamant. “As I began writing I stopped looking actually at the biblical text, so I wouldn’t feel obliged to follow the story as it was written, to stay within the lines, and I concentrated instead on historical research, which was exhilarating and seductive and overwhelming and disappointing at the same time,” she continued. “To me there was a big silence there. Writing this novel was an opportunity to give voice to a silence overlooked by many; she was a minor character but a character with a story,” she added. The purpose of Diamant’s book was not to make a feminist statement, but rather to “[expose] possibilities of power and the affirmation of femaleness in a story that seems to deny them.” “There are around 2,800 people mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and fewer than ten percent are to women. And of that ten percent, a lot of them don’t even have names, and some of them that have names don’t say anything,” said Diamant. To Diamant, the various mixed reactions readers had after reading her book was one of most enjoyable aspects of the writing process. “I’ve talked [to] women in multigenerational families where there’s a great grandmother, grandmother and mother and they find the multigenerational part of the book really resonate to them. There are some people for whom the Bible is a scripture and view the book in the context of looking at their sacred text in a different way. I get emails from people telling me how and why they respond to the work which is incredibly gratifying,” she said. After receiving a Master’s degree in English from Binghamton University in 1973, Diamant went on to write for the “Boston Globe” and several other publications. She has written numerous books about Jewish life including “The New Jewish Life,” and “How to Raise a Jewish Child,” with “The Red Tent” being the most famous.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\nWith representatives from the Stanford Online High School (OHS) joining the Andover trustees on campus, this year’s Winter Trustees Weekend focused on developing innovative teaching methods for the digital age. \n The representatives spoke to the trustees about online classroom dynamics, diverse learning styles and the importance of creating a sense of community among faculty and students. Stanford OHS offers online courses for students in grades seven through 12 from all around the globe, with classes conducted using web-based video technology, according to an Andover press release.\n “The significance of having [representatives from Stanford OHS] here is that we’re just really curious to know what else is out there in the education-land. It’s an incredibly active, exciting place right now, people are looking at alternatives, and technology makes new approaches available to people,” said Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School.\n “However, technology is but a tool, and as we seek to find the best ways to teach and learn, we want to learn what kind of tools people are using and how they are using them. It’s a great question to know what impact any of this will have here; the trustees, along with faculty, are engaged in that kind of thinking right now,” she continued.\n Peter Currie ’74, President of the Board of Trustees, said, “It’s interesting and it’s important for us to learn about what they are doing. The fear I had was that this would be viewed as the Trustees overemphasizing technology. And, in fact, what we heard was that it is the emphasis on community and teachers that matters most.”\n Caroline Nolan, Director of the Andover Institute, also led a discussion on innovation and pedagogy, presenting the sustainable operating model she has been developing over the past three months in front of the Trustees, the Academic Council and members of the Strategic Planning Task Force. The Andover Institute, still in its “silent stage,” is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2014. \n “[Nolan] is in the process of setting up this Institute, and it is an idea that is still in the planning mode. It will be a space where different kinds of innovation, investigation and administration of teaching innovation happens. For example, all of the global programs that we have will be clustered and administered there,” said Jeton. \n Trustees also directly communicated with the student body by participating in a discussion co-hosted by Trustee and Student Council leaders on Saturday morning. Students had the opportunity to voice their ideas on the strategic planning process. The conversations centered on two key questions: “How can we move ourselves closer to learning and away from grades?” and “What would a great mentoring program, between faculty and students, look like?”\n “We try to get situations where Trustees have face time with different members of the community. So this weekend, they were able to be joined by members of the Academic Council, faculty members of strategic planning task force and students. That’s normal, but what’s different was the kind of topics that they engaged in,” said Jeton. \n Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, updated the Board of Trustees on the major construction and renovation plans on campus, including a report on the Sykes Wellness Center, which is nearing the end of its design phase. Groundbreaking for the new health center is expected to take place in September if the Trustees vote to release the project for construction in May. Muench also reported that a solar array will be installed on the ice arena, which will cover nearly the entire roof and will provide 35 to 40 percent of the rink’s electricity. The project will begin this spring.\n The Stanford team came to campus at the invitation of Chien Lee ’71, the Chair of the Board of Trustee’s Education Committee, according to the press release.\n\n', 'Feb 13, 2014'), ('\n## Andover\nAt Andover, there are various levels of disciplinary actions. The lowest level of response to an infraction of school policy is a dean’s reprimand, which doesn’t require a disciplinary committee and is used to punish smaller violations such as small sign-in policy violations. The next level of discipline is a censure, which covers a range of violations, including, room-visiting infractions. The other levels of disciplinary action include warning, probation, suspension and dismissal, all of which require a disciplinary committee. Each cluster has its own disciplinary committee, and each committee is composed of the relevant cluster president, a DC representative, two faculty members, and the relevant cluster dean, said Paul Murphy, Dean of Students.\n“I think our system is very personal; there is no centralized system where you are in [the committee] with people that you don’t know. Students that break rules that impact the safety of themselves or others are generally given consequences at a higher level than those offences that are not as strong and as worrisome,” said Murphy.\nDrugs and alcohol are not allowed at Phillips Academy, and if a student is found giving alcohol or drugs to other students, he or she will likely be dismissed. Besides selling drugs or alcohol, serious harassment can lead a student to be dismissed, according to Murphy.\nThe Sanctuary Policy provides students with a means of accessing support in situations where alcohol or drugs are involved without disciplinary consequences.\nRoom searches are not very common at Andover, but the Blue Book does outline the Academy’s room search policies. During a room search, the student in question is usually present, as well as a cluster representative, the house counselor, and the cluster dean. The cluster representative can be the cluster president or another elected student, according to Murphy.\n“If we have a very significant feeling that someone has drugs or alcohol in their room, as we’ve always said, we believe that all students should be able to live in a drug and alcohol free environment at this school. The presence of that in someone’s room is counter to that ideal for all students in that dormitory, and it’s not good for that student too. It’s an egregious violation of the school’s policies, and if there’s a lot there, it raises the question of whether that person is distributing to other people,” said Murphy.\n* * *\n## Northfield Mount Hermon\nLike Andover, NMH is as second chance school, and a student who violates a major rule for the first time will usually be placed on disciplinary probation. Students who violate a major rule must see a judicial board, which is composed of two students and two adults who all had to apply for the position. The student’s advisor first talks to the board without the student, in order for the board to understand a little bit about the student. The student sits through similar process with the entire board, and afterwards, the board recommends a suitable punishment to the Dean’s Office.\nA student on disciplinary probation will first be suspended for three to five days and may be subjected to mandatory community service, counseling, or any other additional requirements deemed necessary upon return.\n“We feel that it’s very important to hold our students accountable to the community, so this board is a representation of the community but with both adults and students on it. We view it also as education. They have to talk about why they did what they did and process it,” said Diane Arena, Associate Dean of Students.\nThis year, NMH instituted the Restorative Justice Piece, which allows a student who is placed on disciplinary probation to appeal to the board and potentially be removed from disciplinary probation if he or she does not commit another rule violation for the following 20 months. “What’s really nice about that is that yes, the kids still have to report it to college, but at least they then can also report to college that they have actually really grown from the experience,” said Arena.\nIn order to warrant a room search, the Dean’s Office needs a report that a student has drugs or alcohol in his or her room. A room could also be searched if there was theft in the dorm and the student was suspected of being involved. The student will be first told of the concerns before the room is actually searched.\n* * *\n## Deerfield\nAt Deerfield Academy (DA), the disciplinary committee is made up of three students and three faculty members. They are in charge of hearing cases and deciding the fate of a student who has violated a major school rule including, but not limited to, drug and alcohol use, cheating, stealing, or vandalism.\nA typical response to on-campus drinking is a three-day suspension and probation. Probation at DA lasts for two calendar years unless the student petitions for a shorter probation. Much like at Andover, if a student commits another major school rule violation while on probation, he or she will likely be dismissed from school.\n“Right now we are in the middle of an examination of our current process because it’s a little old and a bit brittle. One piece we’re focusing on is including more restorative practices post-mistake. Instead of saying, “OK, go do probation. Bide your time and don’t mess up again,” we want to take a kid, who let’s say is drinking, and have the kid go to a Mothers Against Drunk Driving Meeting or create some other ways to be active on probation,” said Amie Creagh, Dean of Students at Deerfield.\nRoom searches are rarely needed, and the two that were performed this year were related to theft.\n“We would do room searches in a dorm if, for example, there’s ongoing theft, but room searches are very invasive and kind of the last resort. But if we see that theft is going on, we’ll get the group together and say, ‘The theft needs to stop. We’ll do a theft amnesty over the next two days and you can return any items that don’t belong to you.’ We’ll put a box out and if that doesn’t elicit a stopping of the theft we’d do room searches but we try to keep them as a last resort,” said Creagh.\n* * *\n## Middlesex\nIf a student is caught drinking at Middlesex, he or she would be suspended for four days and be placed on a six month probation. Aside from drinking, a number of offenses are punished with a pre-determined clear-cut disciplinary action.\nIf there is an open flame in any residence or a student has been driving under the influence, the students involved face immediate dismissal because of safety issues for the school, according to Carmen-Anita Beaton, Dean of Students at Middlesex.\nA more nuanced disciplinary case calls for a hearing in front of the disciplinary committee, which is made up of four faculty members and three students. The Dean of Students also attends the meeting to hear the case. When the committee comes to a consensus, they make a recommendation to the Head of School, who generally accepts the recommendation of the committee.\n“Any time that a student is disciplined for a drug or alcohol offense, his or her room is searched. We also would search a room if we have strong reason to believe that we should. In addition, we do random “health and safety checks” – room searches at various times during the year. The kids know that we do these not because we want to find contraband stuff, but because we want to help kids to make good choices,” said Beaton in an email to The Phillipian.\n* * *\n## Exeter\nSimilar to Andover’s Sanctuary policy, Exeter allows students to turn themselves or a friend in to a faculty member for help regarding drugs and alcohol. This warrants a non-disciplinary response from the school, and students are instead placed in the Academy Student Assistance Program.\nHowever, if an illegal drug is found during the mandatory room search following a student’s placement in the Academy Student Assistance Program, the school is required to report it to the police by the New Hampshire state law.\n“It’s possible that the student could get in criminal trouble even though the student is not in trouble with the school,” Cosgrove said.\nWhen students breach a major school rule at Exeter, they appear in front a disciplinary committee made up of eight faculty members and four students that were elected as representatives by the student body. Similar to Andover, Exeter is a second-chance school that generally puts students on probation rather than dismissing them after a first offense.\n“We value a student’s experience at Exeter. I think a person can…be thought of as someone we want to have in our community, even if [he or she] makes a poor choice. This community recognizes that teenagers are going to struggle with their decision making and we didn’t think that all decisions deserve that kind of finality,” said Arthur Cosgrove, Dean of Residential Life at Exeter.\n* * *\n## Hotchkiss\nHotchkiss has a discipline committee procedure comprised of seven students, who are elected by the student body and seven faculty members, who are elected by the faculty. Similar to the Sanctuary Policy at Andover, Hotchkiss has a Health Center Policy. Students can report other students to a faculty member or they can voluntarily go to the Health Center and ask for help. Under the Health Center Policy, the student cannot be disciplined.\nIf a student is found by a faculty member using or possessing alcohol or drugs, however, they will be dismissed. This is the only violation that entails automatic dismissal from the school. Although there is a no chance policy for possessing, consumption, or dealing alcohol and drugs at Hotchkiss, for all other minor violations, Hotchkiss is a second chance system.\n“I think we do recognizes that in some cases, being a teenager is about making mistakes, and there are a lot of different mistakes that are made that we tolerate. We expect a certain amount of growth, but tolerate the fact that mistakes are made,” said John Virden, Dean of Students and Associate Head of School.\n“For those kids that might be on the fence between making a decision to use drugs or alcohol or to experiment with it, the no-chance system, I think acts as a deterrent for them,” he continued.\nThere is a room search policy at Hotchkiss, but it happens about less than once a year, according to Virden. Rooms can be searched if there has been theft in the dormitory, or if a student is suspected of holding drugs or alcohol in his or her room. “We tell the kids flat out that the rooms belong to the school. They can be searched at any time,” he said.\nIn the case of room searching, the dormitory head and Virden himself would take charge. In the case of a specific student’s room search, the student and the faculty advisor would be present. If the entire dorm were searched, other faculty members would also be present. If drugs or alcohol were found, the student would have to attend a disciplinary committee meeting, according to Virden.\n* * *\n## St. Paul’s School\nThe result of all major disciplinary cases are read aloud at Chapel, St. Paul’s School’s (SPS) equivalent of All School Meeting, which meets four days a week. The Rector, who is SPS’ head of school, reads the name of the student, his or her violation, and the response from the school to that violation.\n“When we talk about it with students early in the school year, we say it’s a means of drawing closure to the event. It becomes a form of support. The intention is not to shame kids. It’s to hold kids accountable, to welcome them back into the community and give them support,” said Chad Green, Dean of Students at SPS.\nWhen a student breaks a major school rule, he or she comes before the Disciplinary Committee in a hearing. Eight faculty members, four Student Council members, and a faculty chair comprise the committee. In addition, the student can choose to have both another student council representative and an advocate who serves like a character witness. Statements written by the student and sometimes by a faculty member or the Dean’s office are then distributed. There is a period for questions and then student and the advocate leave so the committee can deliberate.\n“It’s not done by consensus and there’s not really a vote. They just get to a place where they each have made recommendations. Then, the chair of the committee and myself meet with and bring that recommendation to the Rector. The Rector ultimately makes the final decision. I would say the vast majority of the time the Rector supports the decision made by the disciplinary committee but that’s not always the case,” said Green.\n“Being a school where the Rector really has final say, if there’s a student that does something that just does not sit well with us like a student has been egregiously unkind to others or is doing harm to others, the Rector is not shy about just dismissing outright on the first go. We’re not tied in to always being a second-chance school. But I’d say for drugs and alcohol, that’s on some level fairly common adolescent behavior, and we don’t see it very prudent to be booting kids when we might actually be able to help them and they can grown from that experience,” continued Green.\n\n', 'Feb 7, 2014'), ('\nFormer United States Olympic Coxswain Stewart MacDonald will join Andover Crew this spring as the new Coach of Boys Crew, replacing Peter Washburn, Instructor in Mathematics and Director of Andover Crew, who has taken a leave of absence for the Winter and Spring Terms. \n Dale Hurley, Instructor in Mathematics, is now the Interim Director of the entire crew program and will continue to coach Girls Crew as he did last year.\n MacDonald was hired by Mike Kuta, Director of Athletics, as a “community coach.” A community coach is someone who does not teach at Andover, but has expertise in a certain field. “We hire them from outside our faculty to coach our athletes at a level that we always strive for at our athletic program,” said Kuta. \n It is uncertain as to whether MacDonald’s coaching position will be permanent, as community coaches are hired on a one-year basis, according to Kuta. \n “MacDonald’s résumé is very impressive. He is a leader and also well-organized. He’s a team player and a team builder. Those are the qualities that I look for in coaches. One thing that I’m really happy to report is that all of our coaches connect with our kids, and Mr. MacDonald shares that quality as well,” said Kuta.\n MacDonald and Hurley have known each other since 1989. They met at the United States Lightweight Men’s program, where Hurley was one of the rowers in a boat MacDonald coached for the World Championships from 1989 through 1992.\n “Mr. MacDonald is an extremely accomplished and qualified coach. He has over ten years of experience coaching and teaching in a boarding school. He understands the importance of being both academically and athletically strong,” said Hurley.\n Prior to his new role as the Boys Coach, MacDonald has had previous connections with Andover Crew.\n “In 2007, the [Andover] Girls Coach, Kathryn Green, who had been a member of the Women’s Crew at Boston University during my tenure there, asked for some advice for the terrific silver medal crew that she took to Henley Women’s Regatta, and for the following three years I continued as an occasional consultant for her and the Andover Girls program,” said MacDonald.\n His daughter, Dylan MacDonald ’13, was a coxswain for the Andover Boys team. “With Dylan’s graduation last June, I thought I was done, but change and chance have a way of altering our plans!” said MacDonald.\n MacDonald said he is looking forward to this crew season. “I want to be able to help [students] reach their potential. I don’t know the students yet, but I want to help them reach whatever goal they set for themselves,” said MacDonald. \n MacDonald’s passion for crew started in his seventh grade year at Belmont Hill, where he was the coxswain for six years before going to the University of Wisconsin. \n “Rowing can be an addicting sport. Once you are exposed, it never lets go of you,” said MacDonald.\n At the University of Wisconsin, he coxed Varsity for three years. During those years and immediately thereafter, MacDonald left school to cox for both the 1968 and 1972 Olympic Teams. The team placed fifth both times.\n MacDonald was one of the United States Rowing National Team coaches. First working as an assistant coach for the women’s team at the 1981 World Championships and leading the first U.S. Lightweight Women’s team into the international environment in 1982, he soon was named the Assistant Men’s Coach for the 1984 Olympic Team at the Los Angeles Regatta.\n Prior to helping coach the U.S. National Team, MacDonald coached at the Kent School and started the Kent Girls program in 1973. At Kent, MacDonald worked with Hart Perry, Founder of the National Rowing Foundation.\n After his departure from Kent, MacDonald returned to Belmont Hill, where he spent the following 12 years teaching history and working with the Crew program. During that time, he also coached the Varsity Women’s team at Boston University.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nAs Joy Ekuta stood in the center of a humble home in a rural village of Zambia, she could only watch as tears began to stream down a mother’s face upon learning that her six-week-old child had contracted HIV at birth. \n Stories like this are recurrent throughout developing nations like Zambia. Ekuta was brought to campus by the Andover Global Health Initiative (AGHI), a student organization aiming to educate the Andover community on global health issues. During her presentation last Sunday, Ekuta recounted her experience as a Global Public Service Academies medical fellow and her assistance in the effort to fight the spread of HIV in Zambia.\n In 2007, 19.7 percent of Zambia’s urban and 10.3 percent of the country’s rural population was infected with the virus, according to the 2011 Zambia Country Progress Report by the United Nations.\n Ekuta noted that the prevalence of HIV in Zambia was partly due to the social stigma of the disease, which compels many to refuse testing, reject medication and even lie about their condition.\n “I’ve found that the word ‘HIV’ affects me when I am talking to people… People don’t want to talk about HIV, and, because of that, they just shut down the conversation… There was a lot of stigma originally in the [United States], and yet we have been able to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of the disease. If we can eradicate that factor of mother-to-child transmission, we can bring down the HIV rate significantly in other countries,” said Ekuta.\n “Every time we got around the subject of asking questions around HIV, every mother I approached would avert her eyes or she would not want to answer the question. Some of the mothers would even lie at first,” she continued. “[Women] don’t want to find out that ‘yes, I’m positive,’ so a lot of people leave it to the fact that they aren’t going to get tested at all.”\n Ekuta’s research took her to many clinics throughout Zambia. Upon arriving in the country, she was shocked to find the lack of medical staff aiding the women. This problem affects clinics all across Zambia and is an issue that many other developing countries face. \n “On this day that I went to the clinic, there was one clinical staff for the whole place, who was supposed to take the weight of all the babies, take the heights of all the babies, as well as prescribe the medication for all these women in one day. That’s not very possible at all, which means not everybody gets any sort of help,” said Ekuta.\n Ekuta attributes understaffing at these facilities to the lack of medical education among the Zambian population. Due to the high cost of a full medical education and a general lack of interest in the field, many Zambians look for careers in other areas.\n There are other factors that contribute to the spread of HIV besides the stigma of the disease and the understaffing of medical clinics. Because the majority of women in Zambia are forced to make 12 to 13-mile walks from their homes to medical clinics, they further delay in receiving HIV medication for their newly born children. To protect children from mother-to-child transmission of the virus, HIV medication needs to be delivered within 72 hours of the birth. \n One solution Ekuta has proposed is the Pratt Pouch, a container that can store singular doses of medication for up to 12 months.\n “If the medication can stay in [the Pratt Pouch] for 12 months, we can provide single doses of the medication to the mothers during [prenatal care visits]. That way, if the mother happens to deliver at home, she can still start the anti-retroviral medication and come back to the clinics for the regular refills,” said Ekuta.\n Ekuta currently plans to travel back to Nigeria, her home country. Nigeria has the highest density of people infected with HIV in the world. On her journey home, she hopes to work with people to help break down the stigma of the virus and to help them acknowledge the problematic existence of HIV.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nDreaming of becoming a doctor as a child, Don Francis had no idea that he would become the foremost researcher of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a disease that characterized the 1980s and 1990s in America and continues to be prevalent across the globe. After working to help eradicate smallpox around the world, Francis became one of the first scientists to spearhead research of AIDS. In 1981, he began his long study in search of the syndrome’s symptoms and possible cures. After attempts to find a vaccine failed, Francis started Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (GSID), a non-profit organization that works to develop accessible vaccines for AIDS and Dengue Fever. Francis talked about his career path last Friday night in a presentation sponsored by the Andover Global Health Initiative, a student organization that looks to educate the Andover community on health issues around the world. In his presentation, Francis described his unconventional path to becoming the Executive Director of GSID and encouraged Andover students to take chances in their careers. Working with those affected by AIDS, Francis was able to see the ways in which a social stigma can affect the perception of a medical issue. As the disease became increasingly associated with homosexuality, which was largely not accepted by conservatives in the 1980s, Francis faced challenges in his research. When the Center for Disease Control (CDC) asked Francis to develop a prevention program for AIDS, the program was denied funding by the government. Later, CDC received notice that they should fire Francis for his research of AIDS, mainly due to the liberal nature of his research. Eventually however, he was allowed to stay at CDC and soon became the director of the AIDS program. “[The hardest moment is] when your overall boss tells you that you are being transferred to a back-room disease because your public stands have stood out against the Republican Administration above the CDC. But I won that battle with the help of well-known doctors,” said Francis. While the AIDS epidemic had started in 1981, Ronald Reagan, the Republican president at the time, only acknowledged it publicly in 1986, according to AIDS.gov. After leaving the CDC in 1993, he started his own company, VaxGen, to continue the search for a cure to AIDS. He then started GSID to continue in the area of public health and to work with other scientists to solve infectious diseases beyond AIDS with a humanitarian purpose. Francis’s interest in public health began during medical school, when he took a three-month internship in India. “[The] fellowship in India sent me way out of the bush, way out to the base of the Himalaya mountains… I had a pediatric internship all lined up. It was such an interesting experience that I literally wrote a letter from India saying that I couldn’t come… so I stayed for the better part of a year in India,” said Francis. As the Vietnam War progressed, Francis, after graduating from medical school, went to work for the CDC which qualified as government service and exempted him from being drafted. After two years of working with CDC, Francis was asked to help eradicate smallpox from the world. Francis and other CDC workers set off with the plan of vaccinating everyone in the world. Francis helped with smallpox eradication in Sudan, India and Bangladesh, leading up to the eradication of the disease in 1977.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nOn Thursday night, the 30 students of _The Phillipian_ Board CXXXVI emerged from the hallows of the basement of Morse to make the familiar trek back to their respective dorms one last time.\nThis week marks the last issue for the 136th board and the first for the 137th.

Many American diaspora Jews—non-Israeli Jews dispersed throughout the world—feel changes in their perceptions of their Jewish identities after returning from Israel. In her Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar presentation last Friday, titled “Taglit-Birthright: Universalizing the Israel Experience,” Chazen sought to explore why these changes occur after a journey to Israel. \n To focus her presentation and see why these changes in perception occur, Chazen looked specifically at the Taglit-Birthright (Birthright), a program dedicated to ensuring the continuation of Jewish culture and traditions. Birthright sponsors ten-day trips to Israel for young Jewish adults, according to the program’s website.\n Chazen emphasized the connection to the land of Israel as vital to her experience in the country. In the Birthright program, participants partake in Tiyulim or hiking in order to engage with the landscape of the country.\n “[Birthright] centers around the belief of really feeling and knowing… In order to know something, you have to feel it and it has to be [emotional]… [To] know the land of Israel is to commune with the land of Israel,” said Chazen.\n “Even when I just talk about Israeli landscape, it’s interesting how nostalgic I feel: the lights used in Israel, the land, the desert feels different, the proximity with nature feels different. You feel so close to the food, the figs and the apricots and the nuts you’re eating. It’s just so emotionally moving,” she continued.\n Additionally, Birthright values the personal connections participants foster while in Israel, especially the ones with fellow diaspora Jews on the trip. During the ten-day trip, participants are assigned to permanent bus-groups based on geographical origin so they connect with the friends made in Israel once they return home.\n “People begin to view Israel not only as the homeland, but as the place where they met and shared experiences with new people and new friends who they have maintained relationships for a long time,” said Chazen. \n Birthright participants are also given the opportunity to interact with Israeli Jews, including Israeli soldiers, on the trip. This helps diaspora Jews form personal relationships within the country and help the way in which participants view Israel and Judaism when they return home, according to Chazen.\n “Soldiers, who are our age, who have the same insecurities, same dreams for the future, who are serving in Israel, don’t really believe they are serving the government of Israel, but rather they are serving Jews worldwide. Then there’s the question, ‘What am I doing in the Jewish community?’ [These] question our responsibilities and obligations to the community,” said Chazen.\n The most essential component of Birthright, according to Chazen, is the “tie in” sessions. In these sessions participants reflect on topics such as “how I relate to Israel,” “how Israel relates to me” and “being the other in the diaspora.” By taking part in these reflections, participants are forced to conceptualize what they have experienced on their journey and how they can apply that newfound knowledge to their lives, according to Chazen.\n “In our busy lives, we don’t set aside time to actually reflect on how we’re being impacted by our experiences. But on Birthright, participants are asked to sit back and think really hard on what changes they are undergoing,” said Chazen.\n Although Birthright does pose an idealistic image of cultural reintroduction for Jews in the diaspora, the program especially fails to address the struggle diaspora Jews face in participate in conventional diaspora-Jew activities (e.g.,engaging in Israeli related political activities or sending their children to Jewish day-care), according to to Chazen.\n “In Israel, you can be Jewish without these impediments because every part of your Jewish experience is just part of your daily life. You don’t have to dedicate extra time or resources to being Jewish,” said Chazen.\n “Jewish life in the diaspora is difficult. We are facing competing demands on our time and self definition. We are not only Jews; we are Americans,” she continued.\n In order to help maintain the traditions and lessons learned in Israel, Birthright recently created a program called Birthright Next. The new program guides Birthright participants through their lives in the diaspora. For instance, the program works to organize Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) get-togethers, plan return trips to Israel and connect Birthright participants to one another.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nAfter the preliminary auditions, Casey McQuillen ’11 received a Golden Ticket allowing her to progress to the Hollywood Week round of American Idol, Fox’s hit TV show.\nMcQuillen appeared in the one-hour episode on Thursday, January 30th from 8:00 to 9:00 pm EST. This episode will be the last audition episode for Season 13 of American Idol. She will appear again on Wedensday, February 5.\nSince the season 13 premiere on January 15, the show has featured auditions from Boston, MA, Austin, TX, San Francisco, CA, Detroit, MI, Atlanta, GA and Salt Lake City, Utah. McQuillen auditioned in Omaha, NE, which aired for the first time on Thursday. On December 23, McQuillen participated in a “Jingle Bell Rock” promotional video on YouTube for the upcoming season.\nMcQuillen is a 21 year-old singer and songwriter from Boston, Massachusetts. After graduating from Andover in 2011, McQuillen enrolled at Berklee College of Music in Boston where she was awarded a talent-based scholarship, according to McQuillen’s website. She is also a member of the Boston Common Band.\nDuring her time at Andover, McQuillen was a member of Azure and frequently performed at coffee houses and Grasshopper Night. Before graduating, McQuillen released two albums on iTunes entitled “Enough” and “Passenger Seat.”\xa0\n_The Phillipian\xa0_interviewed McQuillen this week:\n**How did you get started with music and singing?**\n**CM:** I wrote my first song when I was in middle school, and I had an assignment to set a goal. I always wanted to write songs, so I decided that I was going to learn to play the guitar and perform my song in front of the class. That was the first time I did anything like that, and I enjoyed it so much that it never really stopped.\n**How were you involved with music hereat Andover?**\n**CM:** I was super involved with the music program at Andover. I took a ton of music classes, including AP Music and Jazz Theory courses. I obviously was super involved with Azure. I was in Azure for three years and loved being in that group. I got a lot of performance experience out of that. I also participated in a ton of little shows in Lower Right [of Paresky Commons], in the Underwood Room and in [Susie’s]. I did Grasshopper as well, with my band. That was always really fun. I did a lot of admissions shows for incoming students, so I wonder if some of the students there now have seen me perform because I played for them when they were applying to Andover.\n**How were you involved with music at Berklee?**\n**CM:** Berklee is a music college, it’s the biggest independent music college in the world, so everyday I’m involved with music. I’m dual-majoring in Music Business and Songwriting. I played our versions of Grasshopper [at Berklee]. I got into those my Freshman year, which opened a lot of doors for me because the administration pays some extra attention to students who are actively participating in the shows they put on.\n**What prompted you to audition for American Idol?**\n**CM:** One of my professors at Berklee recommended that I audition. The Boston auditions had already happened. It was late in the season. The professor recommended that I go to Omaha and audition because they thought that it would go well. I took a couple days off and went out there with my mom to Omaha and did the audition.\n**What was your initial reaction when you first stepped into the audition room?**\n**CM:** It was pretty scary. I basically was brain-dead. What they didn’t show: I thought I sounded very dumb speaking to the judges before I sang, because I was so focused on remembering my pitch and the first line of the song that I didn’t have any room in brain for anything else. They were asking me questions about my taste in music and all this stuff, and I barely could remember my own name. They apparently thought that my slow speech was me being calm, as opposed to me being brain-dead, which is what I felt like.\n**Do you have any pre-performance rituals to cope with your stress?**\n**CM:** That’s funny. I’m kind of into TED Talks. We all are. We all YouTube-d the ten-minute Ted Talks, and I saw this one that I thought was great. It was about the power of body language, and how not only does your body language influence how other people think of you, but it actually influences the chemistry inside your body, and your body almost reacts with the way you’re positioning yourself. So there is this thing that was developed called the “power stance,” and if you sit or stand in what is generally conceived as a powerful position, you actually begin to feel more powerful. The testosterone levels in your body go up. So, I “power stance” before big performances, and I continue to do it throughout American Idol. I kind of assume a Wonder Woman position, and get into my own head that I don’t have anything to be nervous about.\n**What was the audition like?**\n**CM:** I’ve had a lot of performance experience in the past year or so, I was in a wedding band, and I definitely learned how to separate my emotion of the situation from the emotion of the song. That really came in handy during the audition because I’m very nervous before and after I sing, but I’m not nervous while I’m singing. If you are nervous while you are singing, you are not feeling the emotion of the song. It is a selfish way to perform. You’re there to perform for the song, you’re there to perform for the audience, you’re not there to perform for you. I was okay, I love the song “Skyscraper,” I think it’s got a beautiful message, and I was focusing on that and not on my own feelings while I was singing.\n**Who is your inspiration in the music world?**\n**CM:** Someone I’ve really been looking up to is Sara Bareilles. She writes a similar kind of music to me. She’s a little bit more “singer-songwritery” than a lot of other powerhouse singers who she is competing with. She has always had a really strong “sea-level” following, and to see her at the Grammys and be nominated for a Grammy really earned her the recognition she deserved. It was very inspiring for me because she did it by still singing her own material, and singing what she wanted to, not what record labels told her she should sing in order to sell material. That is who I am trying to focus on as a reminder to stay true to the kind of music I like and not the kind of music that people want me to sing.\n**How would you compare your Andover Idol experience to your American Idol experience?**\n**CM:** That was a long time ago. It’s funny that you should say that. It sounds funny to even say it, but in the moment, things feel like they matter so much. When I was at Andover, I was so young, and I was insecure. To me, at that moment, participating in the competition was just as important as how I felt participating in American Idol. You grow, and as you grow, I think you seek out the challenges you are capable of at that moment. When I was at Andover, auditioning for the Azure solo, or trying to get into Grasshopper, was really important. It really was, in that moment, American Idol. It was the most I was capable of at that time.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nAlyssa Augustin ’15 boldly faces off against challengers on the wrestling mat, pinning her competitors with precision and skill. To anyone who watches her wrestle, the first word that comes to mind is “athlete,” not “lesbian.”\n In the athletic community, Augustin is a wrestler. Race, religion, gender and sexuality are all labels that fall away once she steps onto the mat. At a school like Andover, Augustin can be accepted as just another athlete without having to face discrimination or bias based on her sexual orientation. However, Augustin’s experience was not always as smooth or accepting.\n In an interview with The Phillipian, Augustin spoke about the differences between her middle school experience in Boonton, New Jersey, and her time at Andover, highlighting some of the discomfort she felt when participating in athletics back home.\n “I wasn’t out then, not even to myself. My middle school was awful for a number of reasons. Mostly it was kids being racist and homophobic because they somehow thought that they were being funny,” said Augustin.\n Now, Augustin competes at the Varsity level on Andover’s mostly-male wrestling team, and she finds the experience to be a vast improvement from middle school.\n “Coming to Andover was a really weird contrast. People didn’t say horrible things at the lunch table or even in private. I probably came out to myself here because not only was it a fresh start to be myself, but also because there was a lot less pressure to avoid being the kid everyone was putting down, because that just doesn’t happen here,” Augustin said.\n One of only four girls on the team, Augustin was named New England wrestling champion last year after she ousted every other girl in the league. Before this year, Augustin was the only girl on a co-ed team of around 30 athletes.\n Despite the predominantly-male nature of the wrestling team, the captains and the coach work hard to ensure that Andover Wrestling is a safe environment that respects the individuality of all of its members.\n “My coach, at the beginning of the year, will say: ‘If you come on this team and you wrestle and you’re trying hard, you’re a wrestler,’ and he demands respect for every teammate, regardless of sexual orientation or gender,” said Augustin.\n Not all athletes at Andover have had the same experience, however, and the acceptance of LGBTQ students varies between teams. \n “I’ll never forget when the hockey team staged a homophobic skit at the A/E pep rally,” said Ben Talarico ’11, a cross-country and track runner who was openly gay during his time at Andover.\n Incidents like these still occur and have occurred recently, despite Andover’s progressive nature, according to Sean Burkitt ’14, Co-Captain of Varsity Nordic and Varsity Cycling at Andover. He says these incidents can pass by without remark.\n Kayla Thompson ’15, a member of Varsity Softball and a lesbian athlete, added, “Perhaps if Andover was more open about talking about heteronormativity or microaggressions, then they would happen less.”\n Many LGBTQ athletes, though, would describe their experience with the athletic department as accepting and non-discriminatory, an improvement for students—like Augustin—who come from more judgmental athletic communities.\n “We have a school that is intentionally diverse, and within our community bubble, I think that part of coming into the bubble is you agree to accept people that are not like yourself,” said Peg Harrigan, current Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA) faculty advisor.\n Despite this notion, students and faculty alike have expressed opinions similar to Thompson’s and have stressed the importance of discussion of the issue on campus, whether it is discussion between coaches and captains, captains and teammates or coaches and the team.\n “On my teams, I remember my coaches always set a clear standard of respect among teammates. Kate Dolan and Martha Fenton were strict in the best way possible—about the fact that to be a member of their team(s), we had to respect one another. I think that standard breeds a culture of loyalty and trust that gets passed down from coaches to upperclassmen to underclassmen,” said Avery Stone ’10, a lesbian athlete who was out at Andover, in an email to The Phillipian.\n While Andover has worked to create athletic teams on campus that make LGBTQ athletes feel safe and accepted, there seems to be progress to be made still in the field of discussion and comfort for all athletes.\n “We had a conference a few year ago in which we had a discussion about LGBTQ athletes, and we had a lot of team captains and coaches there, and one of the most important messages that the speakers gave was that you have to actually say the word ‘gay.’ You have to say that, ‘It’s okay to be gay on this team,’” said Frank Tipton, former GSA faculty advisor.\n Stone added, “Because athletic women are often stereotyped as gay, there can be a sort of ‘guilty by association’ philosophy in that women want to defy the stereotype by proving their heterosexuality.” \n Oftentimes, athletes are pressured to act “more straight” or define themselves as more strongly heterosexual. Burkitt referenced hockey and football as sports that are sometimes considered to be more masculine and as places where gay athletes may not feel as comfortable coming out.\n “In Andover sports, and in the majority of the people in this school, people are accepting, people are open. It’s not like we have a systemic problem in Andover. The problem resides in, I think, specific teams or specific ideologies. I think we have to work harder as a group in order to solve that,” he continued. \n Tipton said, “[Athletics are] kind of like one of the last frontiers, if you will, for comfort and acceptance for LGBT people.”\n The goal is to move forward towards acceptance and away from homophobia for the athletic community, and the Athletic Department has addressed these issues as something to improve upon, according to Michael Kuta, Athletic Director. \n “That’s at the forefront of our efforts. To create safe, fun environments for our kids to compete and have fun in, regardless of sexual orientation or gender,” said Kuta.\n “I’ve been part of programs that had out members and have had conversations group-wide. Not that it was problematic for those teams, at all, but just to have a conversation and just to make sure that we were out and open,” said Karen Kennedy, Athletics Scheduling Officer.\n The integration of LGBTQ members into the athletic community is a goal that the Athletic Office is constantly working towards.\n “It’s an ongoing process, and it takes things like Athlete Ally and Avery Stone to create conversation, really good conversation, about things like gender awareness and sexuality to keep us moving forward,” said Kuta.\n\n', 'Feb 6, 2014'), ('\nWhen Toni Troop attended Jewish elementary school, she was forced to recite prayers every day. In one particular line of prayer, males thanked God for not making them female. The notion both confused and upset Troop. “Every time that prayer came up, the girls just [became] quiet. It drove the rabbi crazy,” said Troop, as she shared the events that sparked her ongoing fight for gender equality with a group of Andover students and faculty. This past Sunday, Troop, Director of Communications at Jane Doe Inc., and Lee Blake, founding member of the New Bedford Women’s Center, informed students of various female activists and recounted events in their own lives that led them to become advocates for female rights. The presentation was sponsored by the Girls Leadership Project (GLP). Both Blake and Troop encouraged the students to find an issue they are passionate about and commit to it. They hoped that by introducing students to activists from history, they would ultimately be inspired to take action. “A life committed to what you believe in is a life well-lived. Find that issue—whatever it is—find somebody else who knows it and can be your mentor and pursue that to the fullest,” Troop said. Blake added in an interview with The Phillipian, “I was just out of high school when I started working for birth control rights and access to healthcare for women. I really learned that it was much easier than I thought to be involved.” “You all can really be an activist to change things for the better. It’s about working collectively with other individuals who have the same goals as you. You don’t have to wait until you are 21 [or] to finish college to become a leader. It is more about finding [a] initiative that you enjoy,” she continued. Willa Tellekson-Flash ’14, member of GLP, said, “Every voice makes an impact. [Troop and Blake] both highlighted the value of the little actions that add up in order to make a more significant change. I think that is a really important message because it reminds us that we, as high schoolers, can make an impact in our community every day.” Jane Doe Inc. is a Massachusetts-based organization that raises awareness of sexual assault and domestic violence. The New Bedford Women’s Center provides comprehensive service and support for victims of violence, abuse or trauma. The organization is geared particularly to the needs of the underserved population, including the low-to-moderate income and immigrant populations. Troop and Blake’s visit was made possible by a grant from the Abbot Academy Association. GLP is an organization at Andover that pairs Juniors with Uppers and Lowers with Seniors as part of a mentor-mentee system. The project aims to foster leadership skills and confidence in female students.

Although social media has given individuals the ability to connect through chat-rooms, texting and status-updates, it has also taken the human aspect away from interactions, Steiner-Adair said. \n “So many people have a real psychological dependency on their phones, and the problem with this is it gets in the way of healthier psychological dependencies on one another. It used to be, ‘My roommate would wake me up.’ You would depend on each other, not on your phone,” said Steiner-Adair in an interview with The Phillipian. \n “The course work hasn’t changed at Andover. But the way in which you manage it, manage your time and relate to each other and find each other is completely different,” she continued. \n New technology has radically changed the way humans communicate with each other. High schoolers rely on social media and texting, whereas parents are spending more time on smartphones and tablets, said Steiner-Adair during her speech. \n “When we communicate over text instead of talking, we are losing one of the most essential human forms of connecting. Relationships are about listening to each other’s tone of voice, conveying the nuance through these feelings and connecting through these feelings. [These feelings] become flat, lost and one-dimensional when we text,” said Steiner-Adair during her presentation. \n Steiner-Adair said that an increasingly connected world changes how teenagers think of themselves. \n “It’s completely unprecedented for kids to go out and take photos of the food they eat and send them to each other. Kids go to parties already planning who they want a photo with, how many photos they will be in. So you are actually not living in your world, you are not enjoying the party because you are too worried about how you are going to post the pictures afterwards,” she said during her speech. \n “I think time management and self-regulation and understanding why you are using social media is the name of the game. Social media is a vehicle. The hardest thing is getting control of it, so that it doesn’t control you,” Steiner-Adair added during an interview with The Phillipian.\n Steiner-Adair also had a group of Andover students read aloud select quotations sent to her about behavior they have seen on the internet to illustrate issues of online harassment.\n “At Andover, we talk about being kind, respecting each other for who they are. But on social networking sites, it’s just the opposite. It is actually cool to be cruel. It is a culture of humiliation,” said Steiner-Adair. \n “But when you see harmful behavior on the Internet, stop it. Say something like, ‘cut it out; this is racist; this is dangerous; this is not cool,’” she continued.\n Steiner-Adair proposed several solutions as to how students can “unplug” themselves from the technology driven world, such as planning device-free time with a friend.\n “One thing I would think about doing during a future Wellness Week is, as a community, to take a technology ‘shabbat’ and be off screens for 24 hours,” she continued. \n At Andover, Steiner-Adair taught a “Psychology of Love and Human Sexuality” class in addition to serving as a counselor at Graham House. \n Steiner-Adair is a renowned clinical psychologist, school consultant and author. She is a Clinical Instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an Associate Psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.

I am hoping that we can move past PG discussions, apprehensions and hesitations about discussing the topic of race that very often afflict conversation and really talk about what we think we know, what we feel and maybe some biases that we have, maybe some disagreements that we seem to have with each other,” said Carlos Hoyt, Assistant Dean of Students. Uppers and Seniors looking to deepen their understanding of race will be able to pursue the hard-hitting, occasionally uncomfortable, but ultimately insightful discussions and readings regarding race relations in Carlos Hoyt’s new course, “The Meaning of Race,” this Spring Term. The first part of the course will be dedicated to discussion on the origin and evolution of race for everyone. The second part of the course has yet to be fully designed and will vary from person to person based on the aspect of race that each student chooses to independently research, Hoyt said. “I lean towards some sort of written synthesis as an expression to what you learned. But in addition to that—I want to work this through with the students. If a student wants to suggest maybe a media project or some sort of theatrical presentation, I’ll be open to that,” said Hoyt. The course was inspired not only by previous courses on race, class, gender, psychology of culture and identity that Hoyt has taught at the college level, but also by his own research on racial identity for his Ph.D. Hoyt specializes in racial identity development practices and is a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker with a Master’s Degree from Boston University. Some of Hoyt’s work was published in the July 2012 issue of “The Social Worker,” a professional journal of the National Association of Social Workers. He also completed a double major in Philosophy and Psychology at Wesleyan University, according to a previous article in The Phillipian. Although Hoyt plans to choose no more than 15 Uppers and Seniors to participate in his class, he hopes that every student who has interest will be able to take the class. As of Tuesday, Hoyt said that 16 students had already expressed interest in the new course. Hoyt hopes that students will leave the course well-rounded and able to hold thoughtful conversations with anyone about the origin and the evolution of race, as well as what race means to them. “I don’t necessarily think that anybody’s mind will change, but I wouldn’t be surprised if minds do in fact change. The course is about clearing our own minds and discussing what our bearing is on [race],” said Hoyt. “In some ways [race] is ubiquitous, we all talk about it, it’s out there, and in some ways, most of us have a very thin understanding of what it is, how it has changed, how it is evolving over time and what it should mean to us personally. I hope that, cognitively, students leave with a much greater understanding than most of us ever get around race,” Hoyt continued. Hoyt also hopes that students will be able to use what they learn in the course to inform the Andover community and participate in conversations about race at Andover. “Maybe if an Upper is in the course, the next year they want to dive into something related to Martin Luther King Day and really enrich the MLK program with his or her knowledge. If a Senior is in the course, maybe they will go off to college and develop a deeper interest in [race] and keep learning. I think that every time someone is given an opportunity to dive deeper into a topic, then good things can grow from it,” he said.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nOver the next two years, the College Counseling Office (CCO) will hire an additional college counselor in the hopes of tailoring its program to become more personal and fit for younger students. \n One of the primary weaknesses of the current CCO approach is the lack of contact with students in the ninth, tenth and the beginning half of 11th grade, according to Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling.\n “The idea was not to talk about college until January of 11th grade so students and parents would not get too revved up or over-excited and too focused on college [before Upper year],” he said of the existing strategy. \n Although the current strategy addressed the stress aspect of the process, the late start and easily accessible information around the Internet allowed students and families to be easily misled or build unrealistic expectations incongruous with today’s admission landscape, said Logan. \n The current model particularly disadvantages recruited athletes and first-generation college students.\n College coaches begin reaching out to prospective student-athletes as early as the summer before their Lower years, when students haven’t been introduced to the CCO yet. In the past, some students have committed to a college before being assigned a College Counselor. \n The parents of first-generation college students may also have less experience than parents who attended college. A late start to the college counseling process delays first-generation students’ access to information about the application process, said Logan. \n In response to these problems, Logan plans to set up a meeting for student athletes who may be meeting with coaches over the summer as early as the end of ninth grade to discuss details and specifics. He is exploring the possibility of a mentor program for first-generation students once they arrive at college to ease their transition.\n Logan plans to develop a more thorough communication plan with ninth, tenth and 11th graders that will go into effect as soon as next fall. “To do a really comprehensive job, we need more time with students to help educate them,” he said. The structure of the ninth and tenth grade programs has yet to be determined. \n Other ideas include merging advising and college counseling as another way to deliver information, creating short videos about topics like preparing for an interview or writing essays and bringing students and their counselors together earlier in order to facilitate discussions later on in the process.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nWith her hair tied up in a messy bun and an apron tied around her waist, Victoria Skrivanos ’15 looks out the window of her church on the last Saturday of every month to see a line of hungry, homeless and haggard community members. Just as she’s been doing for the past five years, she rises at 6 a.m. once a month to lead a team of about 20 volunteers in cooking meals, washing dishes and greeting the dozens of people who are waiting outside for a hot meal provided by her non-profit organization, Food for Friends. As part of the Clutch Collaborative’s student panel on Wednesday in the Mural Room, Skrivanos, Drake Danner ’14, Gregory Hosono ’14, Tyler Tsay ’15 and Justine Wang ’15, recounted the struggles, rewards and lessons that came from starting social ventures and continuing them at Andover. The Clutch Collaborative strives to promote social entrepreneurship on campus. Throughout the panel students noted that time constraints and the rigorous workload that Andover imposes upon its students impact their abilities to actually operate their organizations. “Before I came to Andover, [working on this organization] was a really big part of my life.. There’s a lot of planning during school breaks and because we work on a more global scale, I communicate with people via email in different countries,” said Wang, Co-Founder of We are the World Kids, an organization aiming to provide rural areas with educational resources and relief to disaster struck regions around the globe. Danner is a Co-Founder of Shoes 4 Change, an organization that purchases and resells high-demand Nike sneakers. All profits are donated to Miraclefeet, a non-profit organization focused on treating children with clubfoot in developing nations. He said that the use of social media contributes to the efficiency of the organization and allows him to connect with the larger sneaker-collecting population. “[Shoes 4 Change] doesn’t really have any student team, so day-to-day stuff like checking email takes away from my time when I’d like to be working on larger goals. The other thing is acquiring shoes. The way these shoes sell online is at 8 in the morning, so I have to wake up and try to buy them, but usually I fail because there are so many people that want to buy the same shoes,” said Danner. Tsay is the Program Manager of College Companion, a program that collects college test prep books and redistributes them to schools and programs in need. Despite the obstacles they face every day, panelists find satisfaction and meaning in the experiences they have. “At the very end of the year I actually went to deliver the books at the organization Let’s Get Ready in Boston. I dropped off all the books at the front door. A group of kids were there, and I had no idea that they were going to be there, and they all came up to me and shook my hand and hugged me individually. That was when I actually learned that it matters. What you do is not arbitrary,” said Tsay. Skrivanos added, “At the feedings, I love sitting down with the people and hearing their stories. There’s a girl who has been coming ever since the first session… I’ve known her for a couple years now and I’ve seen her grow, which is really special. Seeing other people and hearing their stories… is rewarding to hear them, knowing that they have something to look forward to.” Wang has also grasped lessons from participating in, running and founding her program. “[In schools stricken by disaster], classes have almost 60 students and are still so motivated to learn, to try to overcome what they’re facing. It is something that has been truly inspiring and something that I still carry with myself today. It inspires me to keep going on when I’m facing something hard because there are people in the world facing something so much harder.” Tsay said, “The biggest thing I have learnt is how to deal with people, because there’s so many different people involved, both students and adults who I contact. For instance, there is this one community service director who I emailed for about six months, like eight times, and he never replied until he emailed saying one word: ‘no.’ It was the only word in the email. I’ll be emailing one hundred people in a city, and I’m trying to juggle who’s responding, who hates me now and who doesn’t.” An up-and-coming concept, social entrepreneurship is the combination of business principles with a desire to create social change, according to Janine Ko ’14, Co-Chair of Clutch Collaborative. Skrivanos and Wang are Associate Editors for The Phillipian. Ko is the Executive Editor.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nEvery year, the Academic Skills Center (ASC) opens its doors to help new students manage the whirlwind of commitments at Andover and the school’s demanding academic workload. Due to a recent rise in the number of reported concussions and learning disabilities, however, the ASC has been forced to forgo appointments with students who seek academic assistance to prioritize those with learning and temporary disabilities. The number of students requiring disability accommodations in a full year has grown from 33 in the 2011-2012 school year to 51 students in the 2012-2013 school year. As a result, the ASC has had to cut 16 students from the previous 87 one-on-one appointments. The rise in accommodations for issues such as concussions and learning disabilities, however, has not emerged from a sudden increase in students with disabilities, but rather from a growing awareness about disabilities in general, according to Patricia Davison, Director of the ASC and Coordinator of Student Disability Services. Disabilities can be medical, temporary or learning-based; among these three types, ASC has seen the largest increase in learning disabilities, said Davison. The majority of students that approach the ASC with learning disabilities have Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD) or anxiety disorders, which can cause distraction, lack of organization and lack of priorities—all major academic skills. “We probably weren’t taking [concussions] seriously enough until recent years. There was the lawsuit against the National Football League that was settled in the defendant’s favor… I think more kids who had concussions who weren’t treated in the past are now being treated, which is a good thing,” said Davison. “The stigma that may have once persisted around having a disability I think has lifted greatly. People are much more accepting and understand that it has nothing to do with how intelligent or capable you are.” The ASC’s disability accommodations normally consist of working with students’ parents and teachers to arrange for extra time, moving assignments and assessing students through different methods. “Every [disability accommodation] is complex and very involved, and there are a lot of players that need to be part of, for example, a conversation about concussion management or any sort of situation that doesn’t neatly fit in the box. It’s a time-intensive process to do it well, to make sure that you’re handling each situation differently,” said Marlena Ysalguez, Academic Skills Specialist at the ASC. As the ASC staff shifts its focus to helping students with disabilities, one-on-one academic skills appointments are becoming few and far between, forcing the ASC to rethink the way in which it helps students with their academic skills at Andover. To compensate, the ASC now hosts group appointments, featuring discussions of organizational and planning skills for large groups of new students during advising periods or at night before finals week. “If we can offer one session about organization to 20 kids in an advising period, that might be a better use of our time than scheduling 20 one-on-one appointments. So we’ve been trying to find ways to deploy resources more efficiently,” said Davison.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nA book fanatic from an young age, Claire Messud particularly enjoyed reading stories narrated by disagreeable and cynical main characters. She noticed, however, that not a single one of these narrators was a woman.\n “Over the course of my life, I encountered various versions of this grumpy, ranting storyteller: some of them funny, some of them visually caustic. But I couldn’t ever find the grumpy girl. So I wrote her,” said Messud, explaining the challenges female artists face to the Andover community in Kemper Auditorium during her visit last Friday.\n “Girls are acculturated to be accommodating, to be sociable. Girls are supposed to fit in in all sorts of ways and take up all sorts of social roles. And it is other girls and women who [set up] the parameters of what is acceptable. I know that as a mom,” said Messud. \n Messud, who is best known for her novel “The Emperor’s Children, explores the role of females in society in her latest novel, “The Woman Upstairs,” through the story of Nora Eldridge, a 37-year-old schoolteacher. After having to take care of her dying mother, Nora gives up on her dreams of becoming an artist in order to support herself financially. As Nora embarks on a journey to rediscover her love for art, she finds out what it means to be a female artist in the 21st century. \n “By the time [these girls] get to the third grade, they are well and truly gone,” read Messud from “The Woman Upstairs.” “They are full of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, French manicures. They care more about their hair or their shoes than about caterpillars. How did all that talk in the 70s land us in the place where being female means playing dumb and looking good?”\n Messud had always known that she wanted to be a writer. “My mother always read me stories at night. When I discovered that people wrote [those] stories, I decided that I also wanted to be a person [who] does that. My parents gave me a typewriter for my sixth birthday, [and by that time] I had already announced that I wanted to be a writer.”\n “When you put together a book, you’re taking strands from here and there. Things that matter to you, things that strike you, snippets of conversation that you overheard, somebody’s funny hairdo and a book of philosophy that you once read that you remember a few sentences of. All those things come together, and it’s like making a stew. You hope that the flavors will come together into something that is palatable,” she continued.\n Julian Otis ’16 said, “I think generally what made the presentation so unique was that it’s not very often that you get to see contemporary writers that are completely unique in their own style. I think what made her style so interesting was the fact that it was all so subtly human… It was a very normal story, but just the way that it was told through all of the unbelievable replication of the very un-described and un-talked about aspects of human nature was incredible.”\n During her day at Andover, Messud visited a creative fiction English elective taught by Paul Yoon, Writer in Residence. She also talked about the theme of gender in literature over dinner with a group of Andover students at the Brace Center for Gender Studies. \n Organized by the English Department, Messud’s visit was sponsored by the Rogers Lectureship, a fund dedicated to bringing women who are prominent in their respective fields to speak on campus. Previous speakers invited to Andover include Samantha Power, a UN Ambassador, and Martha Nussbaum, a philosopher.\n “[Messud] is a very accomplished and important contemporary writer just in general. More specifically, I think her last book, ‘The Woman Upstairs,’ addresses a number of issues about feminism: the book seems to both address and deconstruct some important feminist ideas,” said Kevin O’Connor, Instructor in English.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nDavid Gutierrez ’15 smiles and greets everyone he sees as he walks between classes. Gutierrez is an integral member of the Andover community, but his journey to Andover, which began 12 years ago, has been anything but average.\nDavid Gutierrez’s family has held political asylum in the United States since they immigrated here from Colombia in 2002. His father, Jairo, works as a housekeeper, while his mother, Luz, is a caregiver in a senior center. They rent a small apartment on Rogers Street in Hightstown, NJ. Amidst trying circumstances, Jairo and Luz see boundless opportunities in education for their son.\n“I expect you to go way above your father and I did in Colombia,” said Luz Gutierrez in a phone conversation with her son and The Phillipian. “Hopefully, you go to university and get a doctorate. If you don’t succeed above us, then we just wasted our time here.”\nAfter immigrating to the United States from Colombia, Gutierrez attended Grace N. Rogers Elementary in 2002, where he first learned English and began to excel in academics.\nIn eighth grade, a teacher saw potential in Gutierrez and encouraged him to apply to Peddie, a private boarding and day school in Hightstown. His financial situation, however, barred him from admission.\n“At the time, we weren’t likely to admit him because our budget was limited. A large part of this was due to the recovery period after the market crashed in 2008, so the financial aid budget was returning to normal,” said Dana Brown, who interviewed Gutierrez then. Brown is the former Peddie Admissions Officer and currently the Senior Associate Director of Admissions at Hotchkiss.\nBrown suggested Gutierrez apply to Andover, a need-blind school that could take on his financial situation, so Gutierrez spent his ninth grade year at Hightstown High before applying to Andover as a repeat Junior.\n“I filled out the forms [my parents] were supposed to fill out because they were too busy working. I’m guessing that curiosity and pride motivated me to come. I read that Andover was the most prestigious private school. And for a kid with no funds, this sounded like the complete opposite of what I was used to,” said Gutierrez.\n* * *\n**The Chance**\nGutierrez is afforded the opportunity to attend Andover because of its need-blind financial initiative, which provides 47 percent of Andover’s student body with some form of financial aid, and 13 percent with full scholarships. Gutierrez is one of the 13 percent. He is a full-aid student.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nJ.BECKWITH/ THE PHILLIPIAN\n\xa0\nThe need-blind initiative that supports Gutierrez took root in the Andover’s 2004 strategic plan, which emphasized re-examining the school’s founding mission to educate “youth from every quarter.” Since 2007, no student has been denied admission because of his or her inability to pay, said Jim Ventre ’79, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid.\nThe Financial Aid team at the Admission Office does its best to make sure that students like Gutierrez do not feel ostracized. Students on full financial aid are provided computers, a support group that meets monthly and a weekly $20 allowance. In addition, they are given aid when traveling on school-sponsored programs or trips during breaks.\nIf students ever feel that they’re lacking something, Financial Aid allows them to reallocate funds to purchase essential items. Last winter, for example, the team helped Gutierrez purchase a pair of boots outside of his allowance for the cold winter months. He recounts, however, that his purchase came out of his allowance for other expenses, such as travel compensation for his parents.\n“[Need blind is] very powerful not only for financial aid students, but also for full-pay students. For full-pay students, they’re admitted on the merit of their application, not because they can pay. That allows for a diverse community where students are valued on their contribution and their talent and not on their family’s background,” said Ventre.\nBut as hard as the financial office tries to make full-aid students feel at home, some such as Jason Young ’15, feel uncomfortable with class differences at times.\n“There have been times where classmates are going on vacations and I have been invited, but because my parents cannot pay for a ticket, I have had to decline. Or when I was in the Den during lunch and a commercial for, what I believed to be, very nice and rather expensive suits had come on and a group of students laughed about them being for poor people,” said Young.\nAcross campus, he noted, students flaunt their $1300 Macbook Pros, while full financial aid students use $540 Dell E6420s provided by the school.\n“In French House, there were four of us with the very same laptop, but all of the guys in the dorm didn’t care, but when it got into classrooms it became very different. Everyone would have their MacBooks and then there would be two or three of us in a class with the laptops and people would ask, ‘Why do you all have the same laptops?’” said Young.\nFor a student on full financial aid, a smartphone is also sometimes simply out of reach. Even if the student received a free smartphone on a two-year contract, a $40 monthly data plan would require two weeks of school allowance each month.\n* * *\n**The Social Adjustment**\n“At the beginning, it did feel like I was an outsider. I remember meeting only two kids that I could instantly relate to, Benny Ogando [’15] and Jason [Young]. Everyone else seemed to be the opposite of me,” said Gutierrez.\nOgando, from Bronx, NY., and Gutierrez were paired as roommates in French House, a Junior Boys dorm. They grew close with another financial aid student in their dorm, Young. Immediately, the three were wary of the differences between\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nAccording to andover.edu\nthemselves and other Andover students.\nWhile Gutierrez wore his best Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch attire for matriculation, his peers wore Brooks Brothers and Vineyard Vines, brands Gutierrez had never heard about before coming to Andover.\nYoung said, “When some of the other guys walked up [in orientation] with their salmon shorts and pants, the first question I had asked was, ‘What are those? Why would anyone want to wear pink shorts? Why are they so short?’ Coming from the Detroit area where a pair of baggy jeans or shorts that go below your knees was normal, this was the most foreign thing to me.”\n“But what really shocked me was the difference in the price of these shorts and other accessories in comparison to my own. After seeing the Brooks Brothers website, I wondered: why would I pay so much for a pair of shorts or boat shoes that didn’t even look that cool?” he continued.\nKids at Andover often seemed to not use the same language as Young, Gutierrez and Ogando; they seemed to abide by the Oxford English Dictionary, not the Urban Dictionary online. Slang like “dough,” “hit” or “goon” didn’t make its way around campus. Instead, students used “cash,” “creepy” or “socially awkward,” said Gutierrez.\nIn Ogando’s Bronx or Young’s Detroit, students at parties would form circles around the best dancers, who would show off their latest moves.\n“In Detroit, when my friends and I gathered to have parties, our idea of a good time was dancing. We really did not need to grind or go to dances with the goal of leaving with someone. Dancing was cheap and a good way to to have fun with your friends, and it has always been a huge part of black culture for those reasons,” said Young.\nAt a stressful place like Andover, students don’t have the time to engage in meaningful relationships, Ogando said. Students who had never even spoke with each other were hooking up after dances.\n“[At home] you gotta sweet talk the girl, take her out, put in actual effort and then maybe you can get with her,” said Ogando.\nJust like Gutierrez and Young, Ogando feels separate from the Andover culture at times.\n“I wasn’t aware of is how ‘clique-y’ you can become. People will assume that minorities only ‘like’ hanging out with minorities but it’s not true. We just feel sometimes that we can only [hang out with minorities]. That’s not to say we feel like that all the time or that even all of us feel like that, but it does happen,” said Ogando.\nFor Ogando, the workers at Paresky Commons have become his “family” on campus, he said.\n“They are much underappreciated at this school. The Common’s workers aren’t maids or servants, they don’t have to pick up your plates and napkins because you were too lazy or too privileged to pick them up yourself. They were wonderful when I first visited and have continued to just be amazing people overall whom I can converse with and have a nice and relaxing conversation that isn’t always school related,” said Ogando.\n* * *\n**The Academics**\nThe misconceptions Ogando, Gutierrez and Young face on campus are a small threat in comparison to the challenges they face in the classroom.\nEven though Young attended a prep program called “Yes! for Prep” before attending Andover, he was shell-shocked academically when he came to Andover,\n“Speaking up in some classes is harder, because I am surrounded by people who have been groomed for this setting. Their parents have paid for them to take part in many of the discussions that we have in English, History or Rel Phil and for some of us financial aid students, that is intimidating that we may not have something as valuable to offer,” said Young.\nFormer CAMD Scholar Angela Leocata ’13, who wrote a paper titled “The American Reality: The Effect of Socioeconomic Class on the Educational Process, said, “Some kids at Andover went to schools that prepared them for prep schools. Other kids went to public schools. If you look at some public school systems, there’s a gap in resources, a gap in the type of teachers who are teaching there, and there’s a gap in school culture.”\nWhen Ogando attended Mott Hall III in the Bronx, he would often be the only student raising his hand, completing his homework and getting straight A’s on his tests. When Ogando came to Andover, he realized that everyone raised their hand and completed their homework. People articulated their thoughts clearly and sometimes spoke about things he had never heard about or seen.\n“The preparation gap is not related to the students’ intelligence or ability to contribute to the classroom, but challenge in a way where they have not seen material or had the same level of instruction or depth of instruction previously,” said Ventre.\nLeocata added, “Schools like Andover do a really fantastic job at opening the doors for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. But there’s definitely a lack of support once students get in… The lack of education preparedness and the lack of cultural capital is a problem. I think what Andover needs to focus on is [that] it’s great that we have ‘Youth from every quarter,’ but we have to make ‘Youth from every quarter’ feel at home.”\nTo create this support, Andover is instituting a five-week ACE-9 program, which Ventre said will strengthen incoming students’ academic skills in reading, writing and mathematics.\n“We’re going to try to bring them to the school for summer session and work with them in a way which enhances their ability to take more advantage of the curriculum. You can’t repair everything in a five-week period, but what we can do is give them more of a runway and a roadmap of what’s ahead,” said Ventre. “All of the students who are admitted to this school are fully capable. Some just need a longer runway to really appreciate where they are and the opportunities that are up ahead of them.”\n* * *\n**Finding Home**\nDespite his initial struggles, Ogando credits Andover for creating a support group that helped him realized his potential.\nOgando, Gutierrez and Young found mentors through the Af-Lat-Am Mentoring Program (AMP), which pairs Black or Latino underclassmen with upperclassmen mentors.\n“What AMP does is offer an older, more experienced student who can help guide [younger students] through their time here and hopefully beyond Andover. I still talk to my mentor every now and then. It’s important to have someone tell their experiences, give you a nudge to go to conference period or to just help you find yourself,” said Young.\nYoung found mentors not only in upperclassmen and other Financial Aid students, but also in faculty members who have provided inspiration.\n“My first week of school [I went] down to instructional squash when Mr. Hodgson, the instructor, told me that he was a financial aid student at his own school and that it had opened him to many opportunities. Little anecdotes like that have helped me, and I am sure they have helped other students realize that we are not the only ones and that there is more in the future,” Young said.\nThey also found the Andover community extremely accepting of their personalities and experiences. “If you acted [differently in Hightstown], people looked at you weird. Hightstown High School wasn’t as accepting as Andover. Kids from one race would make fun of another and vice versa,” said Gutierrez.\nOgando added, “I was very ignorant when I first came to Andover. I had stereotypes of my own coming into this place… What [Andover teaches] is how to put those initial judgments aside and then do an experimental one where you actually get to know the person or thing in better detail.”\nOgando has experienced a form of “code switching,” or alternating between two language varieties, at Andover. While the community accepts him for who he is, Ogando finds himself speaking differently at Andover than he would in the Bronx.\n“The truth is: I’m from the hood, born and raised. I was still in my Bronx mentality going to Andover and it took me a while, but eventually I learned to tone it down and get with the Andover lingo per se,” said Ogando.\nOgando has transitioned to wearing khakis and front-facing hats, a far cry from the pink shorts and backward snapbacks of his Junior year. “Honestly my choice of clothing has changed as well too. I wear khakis now which really wasn’t a thing back when I was home,” said Ogando.\nWhenever Young stresses over a hard test or ponders his difficulties at Andover, he thinks about this education that many parents yearn to give their children. While Andover has provided Young with a great education and made him a leader in his community, he finds himself on different levels socially and intellectually with his old friends.\n“My problems don’t really compare to some of those back home. I only have about eight friends that I hang out with when I am home, and still some of my relationships with them are dwindling because of the class and cultural differences between us all,” says Young.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nCanoeing on the Shawsheen River, participating in an archeological dig and documenting aspects of campus with waterproof cameras are just a few of the activities that students will take part in for the new interdisciplinary course to be called INTD 410: “Academy Hill: A Sense of Place.”\n Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology, and Mark Cutler, Instructor in Spanish and Director of Outdoor Pursuits, will teach the course, which is being offered for the first time this Spring Term.\n “The course is essentially designed to explore the natural world and the environment of the region of Andover and to look back using many disciplines of study to understand how [Andover] came to be what it is now. We will be specifically focusing on the campus environment, but also expanding and taking a global perspective on something that’s very local,” said Cutler.\n Students who sign up for this course will automatically be placed in Outdoor Pursuits for their sport. The course will meet three days a week and will combine the after-school sports period with ninth period, from 3:15-5:30. The course will count towards the athletic requirement. Like any other Outdoor Pursuits program, the course will have weekend commitments twice throughout the term.\n There will be no application process for the class, and priority will be given to Lowers in signing up for the course. Marshall-Walker said the course aims to expose students to all the resources available on campus, such as museums and the archives, which Lowers would be able to use during their Upper and Senior years. \n Marshall-Walker said, “We want to give students the tools to really understand where you are living and extract very readily all the meaning of the history of where you are, either naturally or human-oriented history of who’s lived here, why they chose to live here, why they have been allowed to live here, what they have done to the land and how they have shaped the community.”\n Marshall-Walker said that she and Cutler want to offer students tools that they can use to gain a perspective on the biological and regional history of the school. “We wanted a course that would offer students a way of developing a ‘sense of place’ at Andover,” said Marshall-Walker.\n Rather than learning in a traditional classroom, students will canoe on the Shawsheen River on a weekly basis to observe and discuss the historical junctures along the river, including the urbanization and the industrial development of the region. The class will take advantage of the log cabin in the sanctuary, where students will receive brief lectures and share reflections or presentations. Students will hike through particular areas of campus and participate in archeological digs with the Peabody Museum. \n The assignments for the course will be project-based. Students will have the chance to start their own blog and document aspects of the campus with high-end waterproof cameras, according to Cutler. \n Members of the History department, the Biology department, the Andover Historical Society, the Peabody Museum, the Addison Gallery and this year’s Artist in Residence, James Prosek, will collaborate with the interdisciplinary course. Head of School John Palfrey will also teach a few classes on the institutional ethics that Andover has lived by in shaping the land of the Academy. \n The course will eventually culminate in a larger presentation for the Andover community, where participating students will discuss how a “sense of place” translates to the “responsibility of a place.”\n Marshall-Walker said the ultimate goal of the course is the stewardship of the land moving forward. “If we were to take a picture of this campus a hundred years from now, what would we hope to see? Or even fear what we might see? We need to think about our roles in stewarding these natural resources,” said Marshall-Walker.\n “We’re hoping to build a class of 12 students, and I hope that there will be a variety of students, not just Eco-Action students, because that would very much be preaching to the choir. I want to attract some students who are looking for a different kind of science or a different kind of humanities class or even other subjects like anthropology,” said Cutler. \n An informational session will be held for students interested in the course on February 4 from 6-7 p.m. in Ada’s Room in Paresky Commons.\n\n', 'Jan 30, 2014'), ('\nOn Monday, Michael Fowlin sat in a chair on stage with his shoulders scrunched up high and his neck twisted as he attempted to imitate a young boy with cerebral palsy. “Why did I have to be a mistake?” Fowlin asked the audience. As he told of the boy’s struggles, whether real or not, members of the Junior Class were overcome by emotion, some were even moved to tears.\n Fowlin’s performance was part of this year’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebration on Monday. Students attended various events and workshops that were aimed to promote self-reflection, discussion and discovery regarding diversity.\n As in previous years, Juniors watched Fowlin’s one man show, “You Don’t Know Me Until You Know Me,” in Tang Theater. Tackling topics such as race, discrimination, violence prevention, suicide, gender equity and homophobia, Fowlin told the stories of different characters he vocally impersonated, in his 75-minute performance.\n “[He told us that there] is something higher to earn than just a letter, or a number or a percentage, and it doesn’t really define us, just like none of the characters he portrayed were defined by their outward appearance… It’s more powerful than anything somebody else could have said to us,” said Auguste White ’17, as she reflected on Fowlin’s last words, “Nobody on their deathbed said, ‘I wish I’d gotten more sixes.’”\n White saw Fowlin’s shows a valuable experience. “We are just newly inheriting the reputation and the lifestyle [at Andover], so I think it was great for him to catch us before we fall into the pattern of being too judgmental or turning our noses up at other people, which I guess can happen when you’re in such a prestigious environment,” she continued.\n Lowers attended a screening of “American Promise,” a film that profiled the lives of Idris and Seun, two middle-class black kids who lived in New York City for the past 12 years. The film specifically sought to highlight class differences in education and how those differences affected the boys’ adolescence.\n “What the movie really illustrated well was the impact of race, gender and class on adolescence. Those three things and many others are not mutually exclusive from your adolescence experience. [They] must continually be in the back of our minds,” said Janice Cheon ’16.\n Olivia Xiong ’16 said, “Struggling [as seen in the movie] is also something that we don’t really talk about here, especially because we’re always focused on ourselves… We always try and think of our own accomplishments, and we don’t like to talk about the stuff we struggle with because we’re afraid that people will see us in a negative light in that we’re below them.”\n Theo Perez ’16 thought that perseverance and compassion were two of the most important themes he drew from the movie. “Some people have it hard, some people not as hard. Some people get lucky, we all here get lucky on a daily basis, and it’s important to recognize that,” he said.\n Small group discussions followed the documentary that sought to elicit responses, create reflection and open up a dialogue regarding the documentary and what it meant to the audience.\n “You go to school, you go to class, you see your classmates, you talk to them in groups and what-not, you leave, you go to lunch and sit with the people you normally sit with. You don’t really get to know what other people outside of those groups are thinking. It’s just great to see different perspectives and see the different ideas that are out there,” said Xiong.\n As part of the MLK Day program for Uppers and Seniors, students chose from 18 different workshops, which all hoped to “allow Andover students to see the diversity in our own community, but at the same time, see the injustices seen outside our community, and reconcile those differences,” said Kailash Sundaram ’15, leader of the workshop“Incarceration Rates and the Continuing Injustice.”\n Although the actual workshops served as valuable places for discussion on diversity within and outside the Andover community, many were especially surprised by the student responses and interactions throughout their discussions.\n “I was really interested in hearing the different student perspectives, especially because we often look at Andover as a school that prides itself for being very religiously-tolerant, but simultaneously secular,” said Djavaneh Bierwirth ’14, a participant in “Faith at the Academy: The Role of Belief Systems at Andover.”\n Hanover Vale ’15, who attended an “Out of the Blue: The Revolution Starts Here” thought it was important to hear the opinions of different people within Andover’s diverse community.\n “Mr. Palfrey, [a participant in the discussion], even said that talking about class here is a very touchy subject, especially because we’re here. So when people are opening up about like, ‘Yes I am an upper class person. Yes, I am wealthy. Yes, I am a white male,’ it was eyeopening to hear that people from that branch of Andover thought about [class differences]. They privilege checked. ” said Vale.\n Freeland said, “MLK Jr. Day is a time for reflection, reflecting not just on Martin Luther King, but reflecting on the ability and efficacy of a person and a group of people to create change… I think Dr. King was the perfect model for using that reflection piece to also learn about what you can change in yourself before you can go out and change the world.”\n\n', 'Jan 24, 2014'), ('\nRecognizing that most Andover students and alumni are not aware of the work done by the Institution of Recruitment of Teachers (IRT), Asabe Poloma looks to bridge the gap between IRT and the Andover community as she takes on her new role as the Executive Director of IRT.\n IRT supports undergraduate students and recent college graduates who are interested in diversity and pursuing careers in education by offering a four-week summer course, as well as a year-long mentoring program in preparation for education-related graduate school. Poloma, current Director and Interim Executive Director of IRT, will succeed Kelly Wise, who founded IRT in 1990.\n Poloma hopes to address the lack of diversity in the nation’s teaching institutions and enhance education systems across the country, leading IRT’s effort to increase the number of students of color pursuing advanced degrees in education.\n “My role as the Executive Director will not necessarily be new, but it will be a shift. [Previously] as Director, the scope of my work [was] on program development, assessment and improvement, and I mostly worked on improving the IRT student and alumni experience,” Poloma said.\n “I hope to still focus on these aspects, but I think my role will change in the sense that I will have to be more externally focused— really looking to develop new partnerships, both internally with PA, but also looking nationally [and] creating new connections that help IRT advance its mission,” she continued.\n Poloma’s passion, managerial skills and dedication to improving the performances of IRT students distinguishes her from the other finalists for the position, said Stephen Frank ’81, IRT Executive Committee Chair.\n Poloma said, “The opportunity to work with students compelled me to work for IRT. Before, I worked at a private foundation that funded IRT, so I was excited to work with the students directly for the first time in my career, instead of just hearing of them.”\n Frand said in an email to The Phillipian, “The Executive Director position attracted enormous interest due to IRT’s prominence and Andover’s reputation as a thought-leader in the field of education. Asabe has extensive relevant experience as a leader in non-profit organization management, including her roles with IRT.”\n IRT operates entirely on donations from both Andover and IRT alumni. “One of our weak points is that we have a very excellent program, but it’s not very well-known beyond a handful of alumni and current administrators, and therefore we do struggle to appeal for financial support,” said Poloma.\n “Working at Phillips Academy, [where] you take academic excellence and combine with values that are unique to PA, such as ‘non sibi,’ and ‘private school with a fundamentally public purpose,’ is very motivating and inspiring,” she added.\n Prior to joining Andover and the IRT in 2008, Poloma was a graduate research assistant at the University of Massachusetts and program assistant to the Research Universities and Humanistic Program at The Andrew W.

At age 16, she decided to make it her mission to try to end sexual violence.\n “I used to tell my peers statistics, like ‘one in four women will be raped in their lifetime’ and ‘every two minutes, someone from the United States is sexually assaulted.’ That worked for a little bit, but then I began to notice that it would go in one ear and out the other,” Brown said.\n Brown’s original dream was to become a sexual assault advisor, but her high school administration vetoed her idea for a presentation about sexual violence. It was not until her freshman year of college, when a friend blurted out her story of sexual assault, that she realized how she could combine her passion of helping her friends with photography.\n “I remember [listening to] this girl tell me this story and feeling everything inside of me crumble. The next morning, I woke up with the idea for Project Unbreakable; I wanted to photograph a survivor holding a poster with a quote from their attacker. I put her photo and another photo on a website, and two weeks later, emails came pouring in,” said Brown.\n “I had just started thisproject to bring awareness to this issue, but instead I had stumbled on a new way of healing for survivors of sexual assault,” she said.\n Siversky is a sexual assault survivor who was featured on Project Unbreakable in 2012.\n “I had been struggling for seven, almost eight years because of [the things my attacker said to me], and [after taking the photograph] for the first time ever, I felt lighter. I had been spending all this time carrying around the things that [my attacker] had said to me, and, unknowingly, I had begun to believe them. As soon as I wrote them down and let them go that day, I felt much lighter than I ever had,” said Siversky during the presentation.\n Addressing the audience at the end of her presentation, Brown said, “Now, I can see it on your face. I can tell you’re looking at these photos and feeling the same way I felt as my friend shared her story that October night. It’s that timestopping, chest-clenching feeling of losing your faith in humanity. But don’t. Please don’t. Because Project Unbreakable is not sad. On the surface, it may seem like it is, but if you dig deeper down, Project Unbreakable is a symbol of hope.”\n Siversky added, “There was something I found very, very inspiring about the project, and it’s Grace that came along with simply providing survivors with an opportunity to say exactly what they wanted to say, not demanding anything from them, and giving them a place where their story would be believed without any form of hesitation and any questioning.”\n During the presentation, Siversky and Brown stressed the importance of consent. “[Consent] is not the avoidance of ‘no’; it’s the confirmation of ‘yes,’” said Siversky.\n Mutual consent is what separates sexual activity from sexual assault. While recognizing that asking for and giving consent can be tricky, consent is a continuous decision, said Siversky. “You can stop at any time, and you can change your mind at any time. Also, if you agree to something once, it doesn’t mean you agree to it at any point in the future. Also, if you agree to something, you’re not agreeing to anything more.”\n Brown said that social media has had a large impact on raising awareness for the issue of sexual assault and for Project Unbreakable. As the project does not include any form of publicity, word-of-mouth is the main way in which her project gained attention and popularity. In an increasingly digitally-connected world, social media has become a useful and important tool in publicizing her project and her mission. Project Unbreakable began as a Tumblr blog and now additionally posts on Facebook and Twitter.\n Brown and Siversky were invited to campus through Women’s Forum, who discovered the project through the “Feminism at Andover” Facebook page.\n\n', 'Jan 24, 2014'), ('\nLeon Modeste, Head Coach of Football and Instructor in Physical Education, known by many as “Coach Mo,” will serve as Athletic Director and Chair of the Physical Education Department for a six-year term starting this July.

As Athletic Director, Modeste will continue coaching football. “I think it’s important for the Athletic Director to be hands-on with kids and get on those bus rides that take all day. But [football is] also one of my passions,” he said.\n “The best part of being Athletic Director is the amount of kids you get to interact with. That is amazing. I like to sit there at the window at 3 p.m. and watch all you kids start to come over to the gym and that never gets old,” said Modeste.\n One of Modeste’s main priorities as Athletic Director will be working on preliminary plans for renovating and constructing a new athletic facility.\n “The Borden Gym has been here forever. We don’t have enough basketball court space [or] squash courts. We need a new pool. We also need dedicated areas so that our wrestling and dance programs can operate at the same time,” said Modeste.\n During Modeste’s previous term as Athletic Director, he oversaw renovations to the athletic facilities and expanded Andover’s athletic offerings to include LIFE sports.\n “[Modeste] knows the school, and he knows what it means to be an athlete at this school; he knows what it means to be a coach at this school; he knows the ebbs and flows of the school,” said Karen Kennedy, Athletics Scheduling Officer and Instructor in Physical Education.\n Rob Needham ’15, Varsity Football Captain for the 2014–2015 Season, said “[Coach Mo] shows up every day for practice with a smile and excitement.

Nine percent of all students applied to a restrictive early action school, a non-binding program that only allows the student to apply to one early action private school, in addition to public schools.\n Logan said that more students this year realized the advantages of applying early, perhaps due to loosened rules on restrictive early action.\n Restrictive early action, used by schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford, means that a student applying to one of these programs is not allowed to apply early to any other private school. This shows a student’s high interest in a singular school, while still allowing him or her to apply elsewhere during the regular round of applications.\n “In the past [for restrictive early action], students could only apply to their home state public schools.

The couple raised their children, Sophia Walter ’01 and Will Walter ’03, on campus. \n “She was a Cuban who grew up in France, so she was superbly educated and cosmopolitan. Most remarkable about her was her tireless involvement in the lives of her students, friends, family and even strangers. She cared deeply about all the details of our lives. She had a wonderful sense of humor about people and everyone knew she had a heart of gold,” said Susan Hodgson, Director of the Learning Center at Brooks, wife of Thomas Hodgson, Instructor in Philosophy, and longtime friend of Rodriguez-Walter. \n Rodriguez-Walter was born in Cuba on December 5, 1949 and was raised there until her family fled to France and then Spain in 1961 after Fidel Castro rose to power. She attended the French Lyceé in New York City, the University of California Santa Barbara and the Sorbonne in Paris. \n “The Cuban flavor, even though she left Cuba, it never left her. So, she was famous for the crazy, zany things she would say, for her fabulous Cuban flan, and she was famous for keeping that tropical green thumb for the remainder of her life,” said Reverend Anne Gardner. \n Drawing upon her Cuban heritage, Walter served as an early advisor for Af-Lat-Am, where she supported countless students. \n “Carmel was an integral part of the small Latino community when I attended Andover in 1980-82. She helped me feel more at home and welcomed,” said Chandri Navarro ’82, P’15.\n “I had Mrs. Walter as a teacher, before I graduated in 1981 she had just arrived. I reconnected with her four years ago. She was just such a giving and loving person, and I talked to her practically every day. She would reach out to me, see how I was doing, how my family was doing, clearly she always put others at the forefront. Because I’m Spanish, and she’s Cuban, and she lived a lot in Spain when she was younger, oftentimes she would talk about Madrid, and she always wanted to know what was going on in Spain. She had that Cuban sense of humor, you know that love of life, that positive attitude,” said Cristina Suarez ’81, P’12, P’17, daughter of Angel Rubio-Maroto, former Instructor in Spanish at Andover. “Her Cuban-Spanish heritage gave her a love of life and ‘chispa,’ spark as we say in Spanish,” she continued. \n “My favorite memory is of singing in the gospel choir with her.

She listened when you talked to her. She really was the kind of welcoming presence that this intentional community wants to be when we talk about non sibi, when we talk about being apart of this living organism.”\n In addition to her listening skills, Rodriguez-Walter acted as a mother to many community members. She was known for her generosity, compassion and genuine spirit.\n “One time I got sick in the middle of the night, and I had to go to the ER when my daughter was very young, a baby, basically. And, Carmel came over, took her in the middle of the night, and brought her home, and my daughter was perfectly happy in the morning, waking up because she knew Carmel,” said Maggie Jackson, Associate Director of Graham House. \n “When we moved back here [from Spain] in 2009, she was the only person I really knew. I would go down to her house on Hidden Field and would have sleepovers and hang out at her house. We would play Monopoly and Risk and Clue and all that stuff. She would come to my soccer and basketball games,” said Natalia Suarez ’17.\n Rodriguez-Walter’s kind heart and commitment to the community made her a warm presence in the lives of many students, especially those of the Fidelio Society, an 18-student singing group conducted by her husband. \n “She had the remarkable gift of caring about everyone, a trait I will always admire. Her stories and anecdotes about her life ranged from the inspiring to the hilarious. I saw Carmel as a mother figure on campus; always eager to hear about how my classes were going, or the latest gossip, her interest and compassion helped me find a home at Andover. Campus won’t be the same without her,” said Anna Stacy ’13, former Co-Head of the Fidelio Society.\n “She was a wonderful mystery to meet, radiating a quiet warmth of kindness. A handshake from her felt as an embrace entire and with a small smile, she could communicate her message of friendship. When I think of the dinners, performances and church services we shared, I cannot recall an instance in which I did not feel her incredible tact,” said Christian Langalis ’13, former member of the Fidelio society. \n Rodriguez-Walter’s multicultural background included numerous talents and interests in art and traditions from all around the world. \n “She was a really remarkable person. She was incredibly classy, and very cultured, interested in all kinds of things, trilingual, artistic, she did amazing watercolors, and she loved art and music and history,” said Jackson.\n “She was very artistic and made a watercolor of the Kuhlmann’s house, Palmer House. She did that for lots of people. She had a touch with things. Her house was beautiful, her garden was beautiful,” said Terry Kuhlmann, wife of Doug Kuhlmann, Instructor in Mathematics. \n Towards the end of her life, Rodriguez-Walter continued to face the world, including its medical difficulties, with the same zeal and vigor as she approached everything else in her life. \n “When one door closed, diagnostically, she went on to the next, with equal discipline and optimism. She was convinced that this thing would work, and finding something that her body would ultimately respond to. And so she suffered, a lot, to try and do all of those things,” said Reverend Anne Gardner. \n “No one I have ever known has had a more developed appreciation for the arts, a warmer heart, or a greater love of people,” said Thomas Hodgson, Instructor in Religion and Philosophy. \n “I always liked the advice she gave me when we went to England and we were worried about having to drive on the left. She gave me the best piece of advice: follow the car in front of you. But she was right. Just do what they’re doing in front of you and you’ll be alright,” said Doug Kuhlmann, Instructor in Mathematics. \n Rodriguez-Walter is survived by her husband Christopher and her children, Sophia ’01 and William ’03. Her memorial service will be held in Cochran Chapel on Saturday, January 25 at 11 a.m.\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nMany Abbot students, faculty members and alumnae worried that a merger with Phillips Academy would result in a loss of Abbot’s identity. This letter, addressed to the Phillips Academy Board of Trustees from the President of the Abbot Alumnae Association, Anne Russell Loring, details some of these concerns. Today, there are many Abbot alums who feel like they lost their school. Forty years after the merger, it is important to question whether or not the Abbot Alumnae Association’s requests were realized. The Abbot Academy Association, Abbot Cluster and Fidelio Society still exist. But Abbot’s school newspaper, “Cynosure,” as well as traditions like the Abbot Bazaar, are gone. This 40th anniversary is a chance for us to reflect on the impact that the merger between Abbot and Phillips had on the schools.\n View the document [here](http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/coed40.pdf).\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nSifting through millions of satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) public archives, Caroline Odden and a group of Andover students will join NASA research astronomers in their effort to find particularly bright stars in outer space. \n Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics and Supervisor of the Gelb Observatory, has been selected as a Mentor Educator for her team along with four other educators. This is her second time participating in NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP). \n She will bring her personal experience to the table as she acts as a liaison between Dr. Varoujan Gorjian, a NASA astronomer, and the other teachers. \n “I will be participating in the project like all of the other teachers. I would not pretend to have all of the answers, but I would have a little bit of experience and it’s often good to have someone that can help to do some translation between the scientist and the teachers,” she said. \n Although many teachers who are part of the NITARP do not look to involve students in their projects, Odden plans to open her research to any interested Andover student, regardless of their background in astronomy. \n “My intention and a big part of the reason why I do the program is to expose students to these experiences. I think that students are really hungry for real research experience, not just doing labs like we often do in science courses,” she continued. \n Odden plans to post an invitation on Blackboard in March inviting students to meet with her on a weekly basis to gather data and generate plots to compare the brightness of stars in far infrared wavelengths, as well as identify and catalog those that are glowing particularly brightly. \n “It’s kind of like a fishing expedition, actually. If we can develop a list of these stars, they would be great candidates for follow-up work. We can identify a bunch of young stellar objects, then astronomers who specifically study that kind of object[…]might decide that one is particularly interesting and apply for time with a world-class telescope to really carefully study these it,” she said. \n James Falese ’14, who has worked with Odden in her 2012 NITARP project, said, “From my personal experience, I can definitely say that I have learned so much from working with raw data, processing it, interpreting it and trying to figure out what it all means. I think any student interested in science should be engaged in this way, not just with textbooks and lectures.”\n As in 2012, Odden will bring a group of Andover students to the team’s congregation in Pasadena, CA, this summer as well as to the American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference in January 2015. \n Odden was never formally trained in astronomy, and her career in the subject began as a hobby when she inherited the astronomy course and became Supervisor of the Observatory several years ago.\n “I learned many things [about astronomy] on the fly. I love the way chemistry and physics are applied to astronomy. I think there are so many ways in which you can see why it’s important to learn these subjects when you take astronomy,” she said.\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nAs Djavaneh Bierwirth ’14 hurried towards Samuel Phillips Hall for Monday’s School Congress, she looked forward to discussing with students and faculty members her vision of sexual education at Andover. She stepped into her randomly-assigned classroom, however, to find that she was one of only five students present, all of whom were Seniors. \n “I think because it was a very self-selecting group, there wasn’t as much open discussion for teachers,” said Bierwirth. “The teacher-to-student ratio in most rooms was definitely more than two to one, and that is simply not conducive to discussion groups. Having less than four students in every room for every eight faculty turns it into less of a discussion and more of an interview or a Q&A.”\n Bierwirth was one of many students who were surprised by the lack of students attendence at School Congress on Monday evening. Although intended to bring faculty and students together to discuss sexual education, this year’s School Congress saw the attendance of only 40 students, compared to the 125 to 150 faculty who attended, according to Junius Williams ’14, Co-President. Last spring’s School Congress drew 90 student attendees. \n “[Some students] feel that this is a conversation that isn’t best had with faculty present. Most of the students who attended were upperclassmen,” said Williams. “Uppers and Seniors feel more confident and more comfortable talking about these things, having experienced the school more, having gotten to form relationships with teachers and adults.”\n Williams continued, “I think that there was a more nuanced discussion than one might think initially, but again I do understand why people might perceive it as being one-sided due to the nature of the people who attended.”\n Corinne Singer ’15, an Upper Representative, said, “Students who were truly interested attended so those with the strongest opinions attended, both negative and positive.” Singer acknowledged, however, that her room did not contain any arguments against an expanded sex education course at School Congress. Each attendee was assigned to one out of 14 rooms at random which would serve as their discussion groups for the night. \n Singer also speculated that poor publicity and timing were responsible for low student attendance. \n The discussion has had no direct influence on school policy thus far, but instead provided topics and ideas for faculty and Student Council to consider during future meetings, according to Williams. Proposed reforms to the sex education program included enhanced parietal talks, consistency among sex ed programs and clarifications for school policy.\n “My sense was that students in the session felt like it certainly could be better, but there wasn’t a clear need for a different sexual education program,” said Head of School John Palfrey. “It can be quite uneven sometimes, so we could be more consistent.”\n Many participants dwelled on the vagueness of the the Blue Book’s current policy on sex. It currently states that “sexual intimacy between students at Phillips Academy is inappropriate,” but does not dictate any specific repercussions for students engaging in sexual activity. 4\n “I think there is a level of vagueness with respect to the current policy that needs to be clarified. I do think that we need to have a conversation about sex education, but before we get there, there has to be an examination of the policy,” said Williams. \n Parietal talks, or yearly discussions within dorms about relationships prior to the beginning of room visits, were identified as inconsistent aspects of the sexual education curriculum that only generate further confusion among students. \n “It can be difficult for math teachers and French teachers to be having these sorts of discussions without proper training,” said Raj Mundra, Pine Knoll Cluster Dean and Instructor in Biology.\n “We agreed that it would be best to bring in sexual education professionals rather than putting the responsibility on proctors, prefects and house counselors, who aren’t trained or informed enough to have these conversations,” said Dan Wang ’14, a participant in the School Congress. \n In order to create a more comprehensive dialogue about sex on campus, attendees stressed the importance of “high-level” discussions about sexuality. \n “I think a really important tool in a sex-ed program is discussion, and ideally discussion amongst small, same-gender groups of students. Part of the issue on campus—and in the world at large—is that sex is such a taboo topic. I hope that students would become more comfortable discussing sex,” said Emma Kukielski ’15. \n “I’m not so sure we do as good a job as we could of providing a safe space for talking about relationships. I think there is a lot of conversation about power dynamics about relationships that we could do more on,” said Palfrey.\n However, all ideas face challenges in implementation, from taking up time in students’ schedules to organizing and executing consistent sex ed for students who enter after their Junior year. \n “Uppers and Seniors should engage in conversations about sex, including sexual intimacy and relationships. There is no such program offered to [upperclassmen] students,” said Juan Pablo Villarreal ’15, a new Upper.\n “Theoretically, you would have to make sacrifices in order to implement a rigorous sex ed program, and a lot of people aren’t willing to make those sacrifices when it comes from their teaching time, or if it means not doing a sport a certain term or changing the PACE curriculum,” said Rachel Murree ’14. \n Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students, will compile and release transcriptions from all discussion groups to the Andover community. The ideas and concerns discussed at School Congress will be evaluated in future faculty and student council meetings as Andover reevaluates its sex education program.\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nIn the small town of Homs, Syria, Meera Tawil ’14 awoke to the sound of shell fire and the sight of tanks outside of her window. What was originally a normal teenage lifestyle devolved into chaos when the Syrian conflict began in Daraa and spread to Homs in 2011. \n “It wasn’t easy to wake up and see soldiers everywhere and feel like I was living in a war,” said Tawil. “It was really hard to get through daily life. It was really hard to study for exams. It was really hard to sleep at night. It was even hard to stay optimistic. Things got worse from there.”\n Noah Gottschild, Senior Policy Advisor for Humanitarian Response at Oxfam America, and Tawil both addressed Andover students and faculty on Friday in Kemper Auditorium, focusing on the current plight of Syrian civilians. \n During the presentation, Tawil shared the story of her friend Maya, who was killed on her way to a party. “On the way there, armed people stopped the car. The armed people shot them in the car without even asking them where they were from or their political views or what religion they were. They just shot them,” said Tawil. \n Tawil said that Maya did not die immediately and was able to call her family and friends to inform them. They, in turn, contacted the Syrian army responsible for protecting the town. The army refused to help, stating they could not risk their lives to save just one individual. Two other friends were shot and killed that night, said Tawil.\n “People our age are dying, and for what reason? Is this the cost of freedom? Because if this is the cost of freedom, I don’t want this freedom,” said Tawil. \n After the war’s arrival in Homs, Tawil and her family moved north to Aleppo, where Tawil’s school was bombed two months later. \n “My home doesn’t exist anymore; my family is in danger; half of my friends are injured or dead. The children who used to play in our neighborhood aren’t there anymore because now they’re either refugees in camps, dead or are orphans,” said Tawil. \n She continued, “People who have met me here would notice that I always have a smile on my face and I don’t look like a sad person and I look like a normal person. But the ones of you who have spent time with me know that a single burst of popcorn will make me freak out and when a plane goes by I put my hands over my ears and walk like nothing is going on. There’s a lot of things in normal life that people don’t notice, but, to me, they’re daily reminders of the things I’ve seen and the things I’ve lost and the people I’ve lost.”\n Gottschild said that the situation in Syria is currently the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. \n “It’s really the crisis of our time, and it is fundamentally changing the way the Middle East is functioning. How we respond or don’t respond will determine the lives of millions of people. It’s fundamentally important that we get this right. There are too many lives on the line not to,” said Gottschild in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Friday’s presentation was the first time Tawil has shared stories of her life in Syria with the larger Andover community since she arrived on campus this fall. \n “Andover kids are really into politics. Every time someone finds out I’m from Syria, they ask what I think about the regime or the rebels. They never ask me about people’s lives there,” said Tawil in an interview with The Phillipian. “This was an opportunity to give a new perspective because in their mind, Syria is a place of terrorism. They really don’t see it as a place of a humanitarian crisis. I wanted people to see it from that perspective and I’m happy that people now know another side of the story and have heard the Syrian people’s voice.”\n At Oxfam, Gottschild tracks refugee population development in Sudan, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Syria by communicating with colleagues in each country. He then takes this information to the media or the appropriate department of the U.S. government to maximize awareness. \n Although the crisis is mounting, Gottschild maintains hope for Syria. The Geneva II Middle East Peace Conference is an upcoming international summit that will bring together the Syrian regime and Syrian rebel factions to discuss a new government for the country, said Gottschild. \n Clint Yoo ’14 arranged the presentation as a continuation of a project he undertook last spring in which he made a film to raise awareness of the Syrian crisis. After contacting NGOs, conducting research and holding interviews, Yoo published a video entitled “Stand Up for Syria.” The video reached over 330,000 views on YouTube.\n Yoo said the talk was everything he hoped for. “Meera’s personal story truly moved everyone in that room that night. Noah Gottschild’s informative and insightful speech about his experience working on the Syrian crisis, I believe, also provided a comprehensive context of the problem in Syria, as well as the problem in the US, in its support to Syria,” said Yoo.\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nThis Extended Period week, students studying for their math finals will be able to work collaboratively in the newly-decorated lobby of Morse Hall. Along with two cafe-style tables, students will also be able to make use of whiteboards installed on the glass that separates the stairwells and the lobby. \n Various artwork relating to mathematics, some created by Andover faculty and students, will be on display in the lobby. A group of math faculty members is creating and compiling a series of maps and math problems inspired by the Sidney Knafel Map Collection: a collection of atlases, maps and globes that date back to the 15th to 19th centuries that was given to the school two years ago. \n “Currently, students use the square benches, but the seating is awkward, and it is hard to balance a book or laptop on your lap or have a conversation with a small group,” wrote Joel Jacob, Instructor in Mathematics and Co-Chair of the Morse Hall Improvement Task Force, in an email to The Phillipian.\n The minor renovations are scheduled for mid-February. \n Morse, which was last restored in 1959, has also been approved for a larger scale renovation in the summer of 2015.

While they did not find any suitable projects there, they journeyed to many schools across the country in order to find student-led ventures for their first round of fundraising with their organization [Sponsr.Us](http://sponsr.us).\nThe non-profit, a social fundraising platform and mentorship network for student-driven initiatives, launched on Wednesday after more than two years of development.\nSponsr.Us was able to raise over $400 for three student driven projects on science education, bullying and music education. These students were chosen by the Sponsr.Us team after analyses of their projects, project goals and teamwork ability. Sponsr.Us expects to take on two more fundraising projects this year.\nSponsr.Us was founded by Eric Ouyang ’13 in the summer of 2011, and now has four other directors: Kevin Song ’11, Hosono, Jiang and Brandon Wang PEA ’14.\n“The idea is that students all over the country have really good ideas, but they don’t have access to the funding or the mentorship that they need to make their idea reach fruition,” said Hosono. “So we are hoping to give them access to a way to raise money, and also the mentorship to help make their ideas a reality.”\nOuyang began Sponsr.Us in 2011 to give students outside of Andover an opportunity comparable to the Abbot grants offered to Andover students. Seeing the success of crowd-funding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo reinforced his belief that a student-catered platform could be successful.\nUnlike Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which only provide funds to their projects, Ouyang and his team incorporated a mentorship program into Sponsr.Us.\n“Just having the money is not enough for a student project to be successful. As we discussed how we wanted to develop Sponsr.Us, we realized we really needed to build a mentorship component,” said Ouyang. All student ventures on Sponsr.Us are paired with volunteer student and adult mentors who help guide their project to completion.\nThe Sponsr.Us team ran into numerous challenges throughout their two and a half years working on the project.\n“I think the largest difficulty that we ran into was trying to receive our 501(c)(3) tax exempt status from the IRS. We were lucky that we have a couple of lawyers working pro bono for us, who helped us through that process. It ended up taking a lot longer, and ended up being a lot more of a headache than we had expected,” said Ouyang.\nThey also faced a more predictable problem: their enrollment at rigorous boarding schools. Schoolwork and extracurricular activities often made it difficult to work on the initiative, putting off most development to the summers.\nThe fundraising began on Wednesday, January 15, and will end on Saturday, February 15.\n“We are looking to get a donation from anyone. Using the Internet, you can raise money from lots and lots of people. You don’t need to get a lot of money from each person, you can raise $1, $2 or $5 from lots of people, and that’s how you reach your funding goal,” said Hosono.\nOuyang concluded, “The project just has to have a lot of energy. So we are looking for students who have a really strong passion for what they are trying to start… In terms of criteria, also it’s very much how we see ourselves working with them, so we want people that we think we can mesh with.”\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nWhen Graham Johns ’14 tried to explain his passion for dance to his younger cousin, he was met only with a look for confusion and a question—why would he prefer ballet to a more “traditional” sport such as football or baseball?\n Stories like Johns’ are not uncommon. In his Brace Fellow Presentation, “Breaking Negative Stereotypes of the Western Male Dancer: Reclaiming the Masculine Nature of Ballet as a Sport,” on Monday night, Johns explained that male ballet dancers often face criticism and censure from friends and family. He drew upon both personal experience and extensive research from historic dance texts and old films. \n “I have been doing ballet for the past six years of my life, and [prejudice] towards male ballet dancers is something that I have come in contact with a few too many times,” said Johns. “[These are] things that I don’t think are fair or warranted.” \n Johns noted the lack of male interest in dance and how the sport is often frowned upon in the United States. While young girls are often enrolled in dance classes to learn poise and grace as a woman, young boys are often held back by fear of becoming an outcast or of being viewed as feminine or homosexual, he said.\n Johns argued against this practice, asserting that male ballet dancers should be viewed with no more femininity than a painter, an architect or a filmmaker because it is no different than any other art from. By the same token, he believed that ballet is as strenuous as a contact sport, and should be treated with respect and recognition as such.\n “Even here at Phillips Academy we assume to be on the forefront of innovation, but dancers aren’t treated the same way as varsity athletes,” he said. Johns pointed out that dance is not considered a varsity lettering sport and is barred from providing representatives to the Student Athletic Council.\n “The demands on the dancer’s body and other athletes are exactly the same in that both require muscles to be trained and for exceptional skill to be used in the acquisition of strength, stamina and speed. The difference comes in the visual expression of these qualities because the dancer’s body has to always appear aesthetically pleasing,” said Johns.\n Johns cited Europe as one of the frontrunners in the treatment of male ballet dancers. Children there, both boys and girls, are encouraged to take dance lessons to build strength and agility, as well as character, balance, performance and endurance.\n “In Europe, people are proud of their dance students. Kids practice on the streets, on beaches, anywhere without embarrassment. In America, dance is feminized and isolated. Not because of the nature of dance but rather because it is not a form where traditionally American men have exhibited their power or virility,” said Johns. \n “This is not something that is inherent,” said Johns. “Stigmas against male dancers did not always exist, and now they are outdated and unfounded and no longer apply.”\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nWhen Maria Amorosso ’14 walks into a room, she is almost immediately asked “What are you?” To some, she looks “too black to be white”; to others, she looks “too white to be black.” But Amorosso does not identify with a single culture; she considers herself biracial, a mix of her parents’ African-American and Italian heritage. \n To raise awareness about students of mixed heritage like Amorosso, Mosaic—Andover’s affinity group for biracial or multicultural students—is holding its first-ever Mosaic Awareness Week, which started on January 10 and will continue until January 19. \n Julia Jackson ’15 reflected on the struggles she faced as the only biracial kid in her neighborhood growing up. At Mosaic’s open club meeting, she said, “People wouldn’t say anything to me. As I got older, people got bolder, and began asking me, ‘Are you Asian?’ ‘Are you white?’ When I told them, ‘I’m Chinese,’ they would reply, ‘That’s so weird.’” \n Confused by her friends’ comments, Jackson sought a club at Andover that could connect her to her heritage. \n When she got an email from Aya Murata, Advisor to Asian and Asian American Students and Faculty Advisor to Mosaic, that began, “For multicultural kids or biracial kids,” Jackson thought, “Oh my gosh, that’s me.” \n “During [my first] meeting, everybody shared stories and talked about their experiences that were similar to mine,” she continued. \n Although Mosaic meetings are open only to members who identify as biracial or multicultural, Jackson and others exchanged stories with members and non-members alike in honor of Mosaic Awareness Week.\n Hanover Vale ’15, who is of African-Filipino descent on her mother’s side and Russian-Hungarian descent on her father’s side, spoke of the tension an interracial relationship creates with grandparents. \n “Not only are [my parents] on opposite ends of the race spectrum, but they’re also on opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum,” said Vale. “I’ve experienced my grandparents not accepting me because of my parents’ interracial relationship. That can be painful especially as a child, knowing that you’re at the receiving end of some tension in your parents’ relationship… When you’re a race not of color, it sometimes feels like you have to earn the white race’s respect. It’s like, ‘Let me prove to you that I’m the same caliber human being that you are.”\n Other Awareness Week events included a screening of “The Loving Story” on Friday. Set during the Civil Rights era, the movie details an interracial couple’s enduring love in a time of anti-miscegenation laws. The screening was followed by a discussion with Af-Lat-Am. Themes of the discussion centered around love’s power to cross social or cultural boundaries.\n “The story is one that is really powerful. It is essentially about love. But then it’s not about love because society thought to make it not about all these things. After all of that [anti-miscegenation laws] in the 50s and 60s we’re still at this point where we can’t look comfortably at an interracial couple,” said Sydni White ’14, Co-Coordinator of the event.\n Efua Peterson ’14, Co-Head of Mosaic, said, “It was kind of shocking to realize that it wasn’t all that long ago that it happened. We chose to show it because the movie really speaks volumes. I think that this movie will be one of many that can help pave the way for racial equality and acceptance of interracial couples in the future.”\n Paresky Commons also held a Mosaic-themed dinner, which included food from around the world to give students a taste of multiple cultures.\n “Our goal is to provide a glimpse into the mixed heritage experience through conversations, films and our displays in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. We hope to share with the broader community the joys, challenges and unique perspectives growing up as someone who identifies as mixed heritage,” wrote Murata in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Jan 16, 2014'), ('\nGarbage was sprawled out across the muddy ground. Clean drinking water was nowhere to be found. Everywhere that Louis Boorstin ’77 turned, children clothed in dirty rags ran to and from collapsing one-room huts. Sporting a baseball cap to provide some shade from the grueling sun, Boorstin was alarmed by the abysmal conditions facing the 100 million inhabitants of Bihar, India. \n His experience in Bihar was just one of many that Boorstin, Deputy Director of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Program (WASH) at the Gates Foundation, described during his presentation in Kemper Auditorium on Tuesday.\n “The conventional definition of success would be ‘How many taps and toilets have you installed?’ However, our goal, at the Gates Foundation, is redefining success in a way that includes a long-lasting impact on health, economic and social well being of the poor,” said Boorstin.\n Boostin kicked off his presentation with “sanitation roulette,” an exercise he designed himself to expose the consequences of contaminated water. \n Boorstin used one third of the audience to model the percentage of people who live with working toilets, another third to model the percentage of people who live with outhouses and the last third to represent the percentage of people who do not have any access to sanitation facilities. \n Each third of the audience was representative of around 2.5 billion people across the world, indicating that only 2.5 billion people have access to flushable toilets. The remaining two thirds of people use outhouses or fields as bathrooms. Those using fields are in desperate need of safe sanitation facilities, according to Boorstin.\n “The consequences of [bad sanitation and hygiene] are profound. Bad water sanitation and hygiene are killing a million and a half kids under the age of five every year. But simply giving away toilets doesn’t solve the problem,” continued Boorstin.\n Boorstin said the solution to sanitation and hygiene problems is found in listening to the poor and adapting to their needs and motivations.\n When he first introduced chlorine to villages in Africa as an effective way to prevent illness, Boorstin and his research team soon realized it was too much of a hassle for villagers to purify the water at home, as it took time and energy to correctly add the chlorine. A researcher in Western Kenya soon came up with the idea of setting up a primitive machine next to the water pumps that would treat the water with the correct amount of chlorine, according to Boorstin. \n “Not only did people use it, but the usage went up overtime. It was easier to use and peer pressure was probably involved too. If a group fetches water together and one person treats his or her water then everyone will follow,” Boorstin added.\n “When I visit the areas where the projects are, I try to understand what the lives of the people living there are like, but I have a limited ability to do that as an outsider and someone from a different culture. When I’m wandering around in the slums of Bangladesh or rural areas in Tanzania, I look at those kids and think what if, by the accident of birth, those were my kids? This is where my motivation comes from,” continued Boorstin. \n Boorstin graduated from Andover in 1977. From there, he earned a BA in economics in Yale University and a MA and MBA degree from Stanford. At World Bank, he led a long-term environment investment that included renewable energy, clean water, energy efficiency and biodiversity.

By Winter Term this year, the request for additional funding was approved. \n “The school was very terrific in supporting our efforts in renovating the courts. We also did not want any interruptions to our athletic program, so we had to pick a time over break to do it,” said Kuta. \n Because the courts’ surfaces have enormous impact on the safety of athletes during game play, the squash court floors are sanded annually. The other renovations were meant to keep the courts looking fresh and new, said Kuta. \n Future renovations of Andover’s athletic facilities are currently being discussed. A new track is to be built in the coming years, and the gym and pool will also be refurbished in the near future, said Kuta. The proposal for these changes, however, is still in its early stages of development. \n Kuta said that it is unlikely that Andover will construct a completely new athletics facility in the near future.\n\n', 'Jan 10, 2014'), ("\nApplications to six Andover-sponsored off-campus summer programs have now been consolidated into one “common app.” The common application is intended to streamline and simplify the application process for students and allow for greater coordination among program directors. \n Each program had previously operated with different application deadlines, forcing students to apply to one program at a time. Some students applied to programs with later deadlines only after they were turned down by their first choice. The common application now allows students to fill out one application and rank the programs by their personal interest.\n “It gives the students the possibility of trying for more than just one program but at the same time also putting the responsibility on them to figure out what it is that they want out of these programs. Some of [the programs’] features are similar, but ultimately they are all very different,” said Flavia Vidal, Director of PLACES, a new program that takes students to Brazil.\n One of the main benefits of the common application is that it will decrease the number of recommendations teachers need to write. Teacher who previously needed to write separate recommendations for each program can now submit just for each student online. \n A larger goal of the common application is to promote interaction and overlap between programs. \n “What’s really important for the program directors is to get people who are going to be a good fit together and so if we see students who are interested in multiple programs, the program directors can also get together and say, ‘Actually we need a better gender balance in this program or actually we need kids with this type of a background or interest,'” said Raj Mundra, Director of Niswarth, a service-learning program to India.\n Tom Hodgson, Director of BASK in ASK in China, added, “[Running each program independently] leads to a lot of question marks about how the health piece is being handled, how risk management is being handled so the advantages of what we are heading toward is consistency.”\n Vidal continued, “We are really moving forward towards an idea of a strong array of off-campus program offerings and a shared vision of experiential learning, international education, connecting what happens off campus to what’s happening on campus.”\n John Wilson, leader of the Web Services team in the Technology office, worked with his team and off-campus learning program leaders to set up the common app this fall. \n As of now, the common application is available for the following summer programs: BASK in ASK, PLACES, Niswarth, Piette in France, Russian Language and South Africa and Arts. Although Pecos Pathways and Huaca are options on this year’s application, the programs will only run in 2015.\n\n", 'Jan 10, 2014'), ('\nEvery day for the next four months, David Crane ’13 will rise early, eat a modest breakfast of porridge and bike 75 miles a day over unpredictable terrain in Africa to help raise money for environmental awareness.\n Crane is participating in the Tour D’Afrique, one of the longest bike races on Earth. Alongside approximately 30 other bikers, Crane will cover 7,266 miles through nine countries during the course of his trip.\n For every mile that he rides, Crane has pledged ten dollars to Conservation International (CI), a non-profit organization that seeks to protect natural resources in 18 African countries. If Crane completes the Tour D’Afrique, he will have raised $72,657 for CI. \n “There are a lot of issues in the world and a lot of causes I could have chosen to ride for. The reason I chose Conservation International is because I love their approach of working with people to help nature. CI works with governments, companies and individual communities to help them live more sustainably and make the most of their natural assets,” said Crane. \n Although each day will involve different terrain and road conditions, Crane will bike an average of 125 km, or 75 miles, per day. Due to the length and unpredictability of the terrain, all bikers train rigorously for the event. Crane began training in October and has biked on as many road conditions as his circumstances have allowed in preparation for the variable terrain of the race.\n “There’s a pretty broad group of people riding [in the Tour D’Afrique]. There are several semi-professional bikers who are going to be trying to win it. There are people who aren’t bikers, but are relatively fit and will push themselves,” said Crane. “Then there are also a lot of older people who will be taking it slow and steady and are doing it for the cultural experience mostly.”\n “When I decided to take time off before college, I wanted to do something unique and challenging but I also wanted to take full advantage of having 15 months in a row with relatively little commitments. When else in my life will I be able to take four months off to bike across Africa?” he continued.\n On the Tour, Crane and the other bikers will wake up early to pack their tents and bike until midday. After stopping for sandwiches at lunchtime, they will continue pedaling for the remainder of the day, stopping only once they reach their campsite for the evening in time for the sunset.\n Crane is currently on a gap year and will attend Princeton University in the fall. \n “I’m excited. Really nervous, but definitely looking forward to starting on Friday… After four hard years of high school, and with another four demanding years of college coming up, this gap year is exactly the change I needed,” said Crane.\n\n', 'Jan 10, 2014'), ('\nAwkwardly adjusting their goggles and tightly gripping their rackets, squash novices scurried around the courts as they played in the SquashBusters fundraising event on December 15.\n Members of Andover Boys Varsity Squash, along with several alumni and Head of School John Palfrey, taught Andover community members to play squash in three consecutive hour-long open sessions. Participants made optional donations to the SquashBusters program, a community service project that brings volunteers from the Andover and Brooks varsity squash teams to mentor Lawrence middle school students both on and off the court. \n Three sessions were designated for a specific demographic of participants. The first hour was open to children of Andover faculty and staff members. The second hour was designated for faculty and staff members themselves. The third hour was open the the Andover student body, said Tom Hodgson, Head Coach of Boys Varsity Squash and Director of Andover Squash. \n The following Sunday, four teams competed in a casual benefit tournament at Brooks. “MashUp” hosted the “Andover Academics,” the “Essex Country Nick,” the “Lawrence Legion” and the “Merrimack Volley.” Each team included one world-class player, five amateurs, one Brooks School or Andover student and one SquashBusters student.\n The weekend events raised a total of $249,133.\n “Each amateur promised to try to raise $1,500, and more if they could,” said Hodgson. The Van Otterloo family and another anonymous donor agreed to match the donations up to $75,000.\n “The SquashBusters weekend included my favorite two days of fundraising I’ve ever been involved with. What could be better than getting to play squash with fun adults and kids, all for a great cause?” said Head of School John Palfrey in an email to The Phillipian.\n Andover Boys Squash Captain Jake Raugh ’14 said that the amount of money raised greatly exceeded his expectations. \n “They’re using [the proceeds] to continue the program. They need it to pay their expenses like buses and coaches,” said Rauh, who has been involved with the program since the Andover chapter was established in 2012.\n The first 90 minutes of SquashBusters sessions are spent playing squash, while the second half is used entirely for academics. During the academics portion, Andover students do their best to help students arrive at answers and to teach better problem-solving abilities. \n “In the beginning it was new for both the kids and me, and so I was very much their teacher, but I think it gradually changed from that teacher-student relationship to me being someone they could trust and confide in,” said Misha Hooda ’14, a member of Girls Varsity Squash.\n Hodgson said, “The goal [of Squashbusters] is to expand the number of students [from 36] to 90 from Lawrence, and then follow them from sixth grade right to a high school team, but to do that we’re going to need more courts, and we’re hoping to build more.”\n Madeleine Mayhew ’15, Girls Varsity Squash Co-Captain and Squash busters volunteer, said, “the idea is that through squash you can improve character, and instill values of discipline, perseverance, respect and compassion both on and off the squash court. It’s an outlet for the kids.”\n Beyond homework help, volunteers aid in other academic pursuits, such as studying for the SSAT, according to Mayhew.\n The SquashBusters program was founded in West Roxbury in 1996 as an organization devoted to the athletic and personal development of urban youth through squash. The Lawrence chapter is the most recent addition to the program.\n\n', 'Jan 10, 2014'), ('\nJean Crawford McKee former Director of Admissions for the Summer Session, passed away on December 12 at the age of 89. McKee served as the cornerstone of an informal women’s support network at Andover in the years before and after coeducation.\n Although McKee served many professional roles during her 42 years on campus, she was most importantly a prominent welcoming force on campus, particularly for women.\n “Having come to Andover well before the school’s transition to coeducation, Jean was part of a formidable cohort of women who bridged the old and the new institutions,” wrote Rebecca Sykes, former Associate Head of School, in an email to The Phillipian. \n McKee and her husband Peter, joined the Andover faculty in 1947 and retired in 1989. She served as an admissions coordinator, compliment house counselor, day student advisor, tennis coach and a Trustee of New York City’s Oliver Program to recruit inner city minority students to Andover. \n McKee was a member of Benevy, the Ladies’ Benevolent Society, a group of faculty member’s wives. “If people had babies, they would deliver food. If people were going through a rough time, they would be there to give support. It was just this wonderfully caring, supportive group on campus,” said Elizabeth Washburn, Assistant Director of Summer Session. \n Nicholas Kip, Instructor in Classics and longtime friend of the McKee’s, said, “I remember that Ted Sizer’s wife, Nancy Sizer, knitted a tiny Andover sweater for my daughter when she was six-months-old. Jean McKee used to do things like that.”\n Washburn said, “She was definitely one of the people who was a huge advocate of women holding roles and having an equal voice in how to shape the future Phillips Academy.”\n Jean McKee was one of the first Andover staff members Rebecca Sykes and her husband, Elwin Sykes, former Instructor in English, met when they arrived at Andover in 1973.\n “Jean was both a woman with her own professional role and standing in the community, and what we used to call a ‘helpmate’ to her husband, Peter. She graciously co-hosted dinners as the wife of a senior administrator, and she was deeply involved in the programmatic side of the school as well,” wrote Rebecca Sykes.\n Jean McKee’s husband, Peter McKee, former Acting Head of School, Associate Headmaster, Dean of Studies, Dean of Students, Dean of Faculty and Department Chair in Science, passed away in 2005. \n Once or twice a year, the McKees hosted 20 or 30 faculty members at their house for dinner just to enjoy everyone’s companies. “She was the kind of person who, not only did she communicate with faculty and administrators, but was also very good people-person with the students here,” said Kip. \n “If you, as a young faculty couple, were invited to a dinner party hosted by Jean and Peter, you had the feeling that you had finally arrived at Phillips Academy. She was so upbeat and positive that she lit up a room when she entered. Both Peter and she were revered by their dorm residents and the whole community,” wrote Christopher Gurry, Instructor in History, in an email. \n Washburn said, “She was one of those wonderful hostesses and welcoming faculty members. And she just embraced new members of the faculty and made them feel comfortable, and was always aware of how people were doing and always had a quiet word.”\n McKee was also involved in the Campus Beautification Committee. “She did a lot of work with planting things and pruning and making the campus look a lot nicer. That was a big interest of hers. She was generous, kind and a wonderful person,” said Thomas Cone, Instructor in Biology.\n After retiring in 1989, the McKees moved permanently to their home in the Lake Sunapee area in New Hampshire. Jean McKee passed away at Woodcrest Village in New London, NH last Thursday. \n McKee was the daughter of William and Edna Crawford and was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey in August 1924.

Bolo explained that these historicized perceptions continue to make orchestral boards less likely to take the perceived risk of hiring a female conductor.\n Even at the turn of the 19th century, when woman comprised of the majority of conservatory graduates, prominent orchestras still continued to discriminate against female musicians and conductors, leaving them with no outlet to use their advanced degree in music. \n This shortage led to the creation of all-female orchestras in World War II, When many men left the country to serve in the military. These self-fundraised and self-managed groups could only perform in Vaudeville theatres, reinforcing the idea that women-only orchestras were inferior. \n When the men came back from war, they again took the top orchestral positions and all-female orchestras ceased altogether. Even with the introduction of the blind audition for musicians in the 1970s and 1980s, female conductors were still judged for their physical qualities due to the physical nature of conducting, according to Bolo.\n “You don’t look at a man and say, ‘Oh, he is wearing a lovely pant-suit, or that suit was quite nice.’ Whereas in a woman, there is much more connotation of how she appears physically. In addition, there is this idea of masculine authority. Women are taught by their mentors to neutralize their gender,” Bolo said in her presentation. \n “I have had more people comment on my attire after concerts that I conducted than after any other performance I was involved in,” said Christina Landolt, Instructor in Music and Bolo’s faculty advisor. \n Orchestra directors also assume that the long hours of hard work and travelling make the conducting positions impossible for women to fill because of their assumed role as the primary care-giver of their children. As a result, women are more likely to find work in schools as opposed to major professional orchestras, according to Bolo. \n The gendered terms that are used in music to emphasize the connotation of femininity in the music industry influence the mindset of the entire institution, according to Bolo.\n A cadence, or an ending to a musical phrase, can be described as “masculine” or “feminine.” The masculine cadences are stronger and more prevalent, whereas the feminine cadences fall on weak beats and are used in romantic styles of music, reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes.\n “These biases are not inherent in the music itself. It’s not inherent in the composer’s intent, but in the way we describe it and the remnants of musicologists of different times that still remain. We still are blindly following these traditions,” Bolo said in her presentation.\n\n', 'Jan 10, 2014'), ('\nBorn at the local Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Daniel Arrigg Koh ’03 grew up loving all things Boston. Now, more than ever, he can truly call Boston his city. Koh was appointed Chief of Staff for Boston’s new Mayor Martin “Marty” Walsh on January 4.\n The announcement of Koh’s appointment was the first from the Walsh administration, which took office on January 6.\n “The mayor called me with the offer, and I knew there were many people up for consideration, so I accepted on the spot. It was such an amazing opportunity to make a difference in my city,” said Koh. \n As Chief of Staff to Mayor Walsh, Koh will be responsible for overseeing the city of Boston and its employees, helping to run the city and directly advising Mayor Walsh. \n “The Mayor day-to-day has a vision that he wants to execute, and he also wants someone to advise him on the issues he’s facing any given day. It’s a lot, but it’s an honor and it’s fun,” said Koh. “The best part of the Walsh administration is that [Walsh is] very committed to openness and very committed to working with the City Council,” he continued.\n With the Walsh administration, Koh hopes to tackle a number of prevalent issues in Boston. He cities education as a top priority, along with retaining highly-skilled college graduates in the city.\n Prior to becoming Chief of Staff, Koh was the General Manager of HuffPost Live, a live-streaming network run by “The Huffington Post.” Koh will use this background in social media both to monitor the pulse of the city and deliver updates to Bostonians. \n “[Social media] allows me to have a real-time pulse of the city by tracking activity on social media mediums such as Twitter. In addition, we can use social media to better inform the people of Boston,” said Koh. \n Koh said of this time at Andover, “I think that Andover is almost a microcosm for Boston. It’s an incredibly diverse group of people who really care about each other. I very much identify with the culture of Andover because of the way I think Bostonians are.”\n Koh’s advice to Andover students is to pursue unique experiences and not follow what others are doing. He thinks that students who are enthusiastic to learn and be a part of a community should consider futures in public service. \n “I think there’s no more noble or more interesting opportunity than to dedicate all your mental energy into how to make a society, or in this case, a city, better,” said Koh. \n While in college Koh worked as an intern for Senator Edward Kennedy. Koh then worked as an advisor to Boston’s former mayor, Tom Menino, from 2011 to 2012, as a Leadership Fellow at Harvard Business School. \n Before being names Walsh’s Chief of Staff, Koh served as Chief of Staff to Arianna Huffington at the Huffington Post, where he also worked as General Manager. Koh is leaving his position at the Huffington Post to join the Walsh administration. \n “I’m very sad to leave. Arianna [Huffington] has been an incredible mentor to me, as has Roy Sekoff, who is the president of HuffPost Live,” said Koh.\n Koh graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor’s degree in government and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School.\n\n', 'Jan 9, 2014'), ('\nConfined to her Chicago home by cancelled flights and temperatures dipping below negative 40 degrees, Victorian Bian ’15 was forced to drive for 16 hours to reach school before the bell rang at 8 a.m. on Tuesday morning. \n Bian was one of the approximately 100 student who were stranded at various airports across the world on Monday, unable to return for the start of classes in the wake of Nor’easter Hercules, the snowstorm last Friday that suspended most air travel on the East Coast. \n Most of the 100 students have now arrived on campus, but about 10 or 15 are still trying to catch a flight back and should make it to Andover by the end of the week, said Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. \n “This happens often around breaks when everyone is coming back at the same time. When the storm hit last Thursday and Friday, it started this chain reaction that was made worse on Monday and Tuesday. And kids that normally are coming from all over the world to travel back to school couldn’t get back,” said Murphy. Nevertheless, the first classes of 2014 began on Tuesday without the stranded students. \n “I think there really isn’t much accommodation, perse. Students obviously will have to work with teachers to make up work that they may have missed, but teachers tend to be fairly flexible about that. It’s something that is beyond the student’s control in terms of getting back,” said Murphy. \n The Office of Physical Plant (OPP) had little trouble clearing paths after the storm because of the reduced traffic around campus during the vacation, said Tom Conlon, Director of Public Safety. \n “The ice isn’t too bad, because we were lucky [Tuesday] night. We thought the grounds crew was going to have to be in here early [Tuesday] morning to sand. I think they put salts at a few different spots, but most of the rain had dried out, so the ice isn’t much of a problem,” said Conlon. \n Murphy said, “It’s really about watching the weather, trying to anticipate when people need to come in. Sometimes they [OPP] need to come in early in the morning, or sometimes late at night depending on when the storm comes.

To forget that I am not normal. To forget that, because of something I can’t change, others might hate me.”\n A collection of personal stories, poems and artwork, “Out of the Blue” (“OOTB”) is a Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) student project tackling discrimination against self-identity at Andover.\n Today, over two years after the beginning of the project, every student and member of the faculty, administration and staff will receive a free copy of the 223-paged book. Alumni will have access to the book in a PDF format online. \n “As students at Andover, we can gain a better understanding of ourselves through the stories that are in the book. As we’ve been working on it, we’ve learnt things about ourselves, just through reading the stories and gaining an idea of what it means to connect to an identity,” said Devontae Freeland ’15, one of the “OOTB” coordinators. \n Covering all types of discrimination at Andover, the book is split into seven sections: gender, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, religion, geographic origin and ability.\n “As some of these stories attest, we are currently not an all-accepting community,” said Thea Rossman ’15, an “OOTB” coordinator. “We don’t live in a post-race, post-gender, post-class society. These things still matter, and these are things that we carry with us forever. These shape our everyday interactions, and we really hope that this can be one step in the process of getting everyone to think about what it means to live with certain identities.”\n None of the book’s approximately 100 writing and art pieces are directly attributed. Instead, names of the nearly 70 students and 21 faculty members who contributed to the project are listed at the end of the book. Everyone with a connection to the Andover community was invited to submit.\n “I hope that it will open people’s eyes to the issues in a more personal, genuine way, and it’ll be available for everyone to understand,” said Carrie Ingerman ’15, an “OOTB” coordinator. “I know that a lot of kids never step foot in CAMD during their four years here. I really hope that people take the time to read it and get to know their fellow students, and that we’ll grow as a community to become more accepting of others and their differences.”\n The project was launched in fall 2011 when Susanne Torabi, International Student Coordinator and faculty advisor to “OOTB,” went to a summer workshop where another program showcased their own “OOTB”-type project. Inspired by the project, Torabi introduced the idea to the Andover community that fall.\n Four thousand copies of the book were ordered and delivered to campus on Wednesday afternoon. The project was primarily funded by the Abbot Academy Association through two Abbot Academy Grants. There have also been generous donations from parents and alumni to the CAMD office specifically earmarked for “OOTB.”\n “OOTB” is planning a two-weekend celebration of the publication. This Friday night, “OOTB” will host a screening of “The Breakfast Club.”\n This coming Sunday morning in Paresky Commons, “OOTB” will host a coffee house event where students and faculty will read selections from the book. Ingerman said there will also be musical performances. \n The group will also host a dance on the first Saturday after school begins in January. \n “It’s a dress-how-you-want masquerade ball. It’s about hiding in your identity and being who you want to be. We will have masks, and people can write how they identify on their masks, and we’ll have dancing and photo booths and blow-ups of the quotes [from the book],” said Ingerman. \n Freeland said that “OOTB” will not end with the publication of the book. This Wednesday, the organization launched the “OOTB” blog which will contain stories and highlights from the book. \n “The ‘Out of the Blue’ blog is a continuation of the book so that the movement never dies and doesn’t stop with the publication. We will also be holding events throughout the school year and will continue to invite speakers, host forums and pair up with other CAMD clubs,” said Freeland.\n As a prefect, Freeland said that he plans to use the stories featured in the book at dorm meetings. Several PACE seniors also expressed interest in using the stories as part of their PACE curriculum.\n Linda C. Griffith, Dean of CAMD and one of the lead faculty advisors of the project, hopes that the school will use the book during new faculty and student orientation as well as a supplement to the Martin Luther King Jr. day workshops for Juniors and Lowers. \n “With [the “OOTB” book,] you could not only talk about what gender is, but read a story, a tangible and concrete example of what students here on campus are actually experiencing. There is a certain power that stories have that statistics and facts do not possess,” Griffith said. \n “We see [the “OOTB” book] as the beginning of an in-depth conversation on this campus about identity. What it means to be different, as well as what it means to have things in common,” she continued.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nProgramming furiously, Andover students created interactive, animated holiday cards and Chatbots as a part of Andover’s first celebration of National Computer Science Education week. The Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science department hosted “Hour of Code” sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night in the Phillips Academy Computer Center (PACC). Each night featured a lesson in a particular programming language. In the first session, taught by Maria Litvin, Instructor in Math and Computer Science, students made holiday cards using Scratch 2.0, a web-based coding language considered easier than Java or Python. Litvin said many students recorded their own songs or wrote their own messages. One student, however, worked with Alexander Kuntz, Teaching Fellow for Computer Science, to code the beginnings of a game similar to Pac-Man. Litvin compared the “Hour of Code” to the weekly Language tables in the Mural Room. Just as any student can attend a language table and fall in love with a language, students could attend the “Hour of Code” and discover a newfound interest in the subject, said Litvin. On Tuesday, Jacques Hugon, Instructor in Computer Science, guided students as they learned basic principles of JavaScript through an online tutorial, said Abhinav Venigalla ’15, Co-President of Computer Science club. Hugon said that Tuesday’s Hour of Code was less product-oriented, focusing instead teaching both the language and concepts of Computer Science. Tuesday’s lesson focused on syntactic elements, such as variables and data types of Javascript, more “graphical” lessons that provided an introduction to creating computer algorithms in Javascript, said Hugon. On Wednesday night, Kuntz taught students to use Python to program a Chatbot, which is designed to mimic a human instant messaging conversation. In light of the recent debate over whether computer science should be incorporated into Andover’s core curriculum, the “Hour of Code” sessions served as a way to both celebrate National Computer Science Education week and further inform students about computer science opportunities at Andover. “I think [one of the purposes of National Computer Science Education week] is to get people’s foot in the door, and to show that computer science is not just people sitting down and coding,” said Kuntz. Litvin hopes to see the implementation of a computer science requirement in the near future, as peer-school Exeter has already done. Currently, the Andover computer science curriculum consists of six courses, ranging from the 300-level to the 600-level. Despite the breadth of course offerings, a lack of teachers leads to over-enrolled classes. 20 students enrolled in “Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Programming” (COMP-470)—most Andover courses max out at 16 students. “We simply don’t have enough qualified people to fill the jobs needed,” said Litvin. Even if students do not choose to pursue a career path in computer science, Litvin still emphasizes the importance of computer science to a well-balanced education, and sees it as a necessity for life in the 21st century. Litvin also pointed out that it involves the useful skills of creativity and attention to detail. Kuntz hoped that the “Hour of Code” sessions would introduce more students to the idea of computer science. “Computer Science is not just simply learning how to operate Microsoft Word, but rather, a way of thinking,” he said. Nick Rauen ’16, a student currently taking the AP Computer Science course, agrees that a knowledge of computer science can make one a more balanced person. “It creates a further understanding of what’s around us. Why do we study history? Why do we study English? Why do we study foreign languages?” said Rauen. James Palmer ’14 said, “Computer science classes have to overcome the obstacle that not many students come in with any grasp whatsoever with the method of thinking required for computer science.” Palmer believes that computer science should be mandatory and that it should be taken either Junior or Lower year. “So many people don’t pursue it because there is this idea of impossibility of creating what these coders are creating so they don’t even try it. If we get people experienced early, they will be better able to explore it if they enjoy it.” Amy Chou ’16 said that she does not believe that a Computer Science course should be required. She believes that students will enjoy it more if they were not forced to take it. Chou said that a better way to introduce students to computer science would be to make Computer Science Club a lot more accessible. “Many students don’t even know that computer science club exists because it wasn’t in the club rally, but I think it has potential to become a big club like Math Club if more people knew about it,” added Chou. Nationally, over two million students participated in the “Hour of Code” on Monday alone. Although this is the fifth annual National Computer Science Education week, this year marks the first year that Andover has been able to celebrate it, as previously the week has fallen during Winter Vacation.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nIn an effort to enrich student life and create innovative learning opportunities for Andoer students, the Abbot Academy Association granted funding this fall to projects such as a Disc Golf course, an outdoor classroom, a Yin Yu Tang (China House) and a visual arts exhibition to celebrate 40 years of co-education. The Abbot Academy Association (AAA) granted $260,000 to 34 student, faculty and school projects. There were not sufficient funds to award all of the proposals this fall, said Abbey Siegfried, Andover’s faculty liaison to the AAA. “The competition was high this year since there were many more applications and requests for more funds than there were funds.” The AAA agreed to fund the Andover Institute for the next three years. “[It will be] a place or resource for faculty to think about interdisciplinary classes or how to use technology in new and exciting ways in the classroom, and [we] really wanted to help get [the initiative] off the ground,” Siegfried said. The AAA grant for the Andover Institute will support the initial projects of the institute. Caroline Nolan, Director of the Andover Institute said, “ These funds will incubate the seed projects that will grow over time and shape the future of the Institute.” “It’s the first step for us. What will make the Institute rich over time are the kinds of creative and innovative projects that we are able to support here. Having financial support creates the foundation for what will come. As you can imagine, it is everything,” continued Nolan. Rosalyn Chen ’14 and Angela Hui ’16 received a grant of $9,000 to bring Harry Shum Jr., a lead actor in the hit TV show “Glee,” to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Asian Arts weekend. Shum’s visit will consist of a presentation for the Andover community, as well as theatre classroom visits, said Chen. Asian Americans are vastly underrepresented in films and television programs, and the Asian Americans who are seen on screen are often typecast in stereotypical roles, said Hui. “It is the Chinese Taiwanese Student Association’s hope that Harry Shum Jr. will be able to serve as a unique role model and inspire us to pursue what we love, even if it may be in a non-traditional field,” she continued. Nile Blunt, Instructor in History, received an Abbot grant to reevaluate the collection of art and antiques that the Academy owns. The collection of over 1,700 pieces are spread out through faculty homes, offices, and classroom buildings and have incredible financial, historical and cultural value, said Blunt. Blunt is planning to use the money to assess the way important items, such as Gilbert Stuart’s portrait of George Washington, currently hanging in George Washington Hall, are being cared for and preserved. Blunt said his long term goal is to design educational programs that reveal the hidden historical treasures that are kept in this collection. Farris Peale ’14, Kory Stuer ’15 and Junius Williams ’14 received a grant on behalf of STAND to fund the visit of Peter Eichstaedt, a noted war-zone reporter, to Andover’s campus. While on campus, Eichstaedt will visit classes, such as the senior elective of Frank Tipton, Instructor in History, entitled “When States Fail,” and will give a public keynote lecture on March 28, 2014, according to Williams. “Eichstaedt brings immense personal experience and theoretical expertise to the table, after having visited many war-torn countries firsthand. He is a prolific journalist, one who uses his reportage to engage in social activism,” said Williams. “I hope that he will discuss ways students can get involved in preventing mass atrocities, as well as the importance of journalism in shaping our understanding of the world around us,” continued Williams. Other funded projects include a visit from Gary Gulman, a Jewish comedian, hosted by Jewish Student Union, a Southeastern Asian Food Truck at Asian Arts Weekend, “reserved” pew signs for Cochran Chapel, an American Civil Rights trip and collaborative artwork for Morse Hall. Siegfried said that the Association frequently talks about improvements to the granting process. AAA is adamant about ensuring that grants are given fairly and for the right reasons, said Siegfried. The grant committee has talked frequently about improvements in the application process. “It’s not just enough to have a great idea, but you want to really think about how many people it will affect and that’s a part of the application. How does it contribute to the culture [and] well being of the school? It’s really important to think about how it makes Andover a better place in the future,” continued Siegfried. After the submission of the applications and budget proposals earlier this fall, the board of the Abbot Academy Association discussed and voted on which projects would receive grants and how much they would receive, according to a previous article in The Phillipian. There will be another grant application cycle in the Spring Term. Proposals will likely be due in mid-April and exact dates will be announced during Winter Term, according to Siegfried.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nOn any given weeknight, throngs of students can be found crowded around bulky desk cubicles in the basement of the library during study hours, working away alongside dusty microfilm readers. To provide students with a more functional and comfortable study space, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) will replace the tables and desk cubicles in the basement this summer. The interior redesign and renovation of the basement will finish by the fall 2014 and will include new and more flexible furniture that can be rearranged to accommodate productive individual and collaborative study habits, according to Elisabeth Tully, Director of the OWHL. The index tables, which have a second shelf originally intended to hold reference materials before the existence of computers, will be replaced with smaller tables for four, similar to those currently in the Dole Room. “The downstairs is furnished with long index tables, used before electronic indexing was used, but they are no longer required for their original purpose and do not make the best place to study,” said Tully. The tables that occupy the space directly at the bottom of the basement stairs will be replaced by larger, softer chairs like those in the Freeman Reading Room. Whiteboards, stand up tables for collaborative work and other accessories will also be added to the library space in order to aid student productivity. The cubicles that line the walls of the basement will be replaced by new ones chosen by students. “We are seeking student input so that we can offer kids what they want. We want the library, especially downstairs, to be an inviting place where students feel comfortable to study,” said Tully. The librarians designed a bulletin board to the right of the circulation desk where students can write their opinions and vote on possible designs for the desks, cubicles and chairs. “I’m glad the library has given students the opportunity to choose what furniture will be added as part of the renovation,” said Cem Vardar ’15, “They’re truly giving us what we want.” Tully said, “Student’s habits have changed, so we want to change to library to accommodate students.” This renovation is part of the ongoing process to systematically update different areas of the library over the course of several years, according to Tully. “We want to furnish the library with flexible furniture that can be useful for many different purposes as well as into the future. We don’t want to have to buy new furniture again in a few months to accommodate a different purpose,” said Tully. Many students have expressed positive feedback that the library is continuing to rejuvenate its facilities through renovation and modernization, according to Tully. “I’m thrilled to see that Andover cares about its students and that it caters its facilities to student desires,” said Claire Tao ’16. Funding for this project will be provided to the library at the start of the next budget cycle on January 1. The OWHL was built in 1929 and was designed by Charles Platt. The library undergoes continuous maintenance on a regular basis. Since its construction, however, there have been two major renovations. In 1959, the library upgraded the west wing, facing the Great Lawn and in 1988, the east addition facing Pearson Hall was built, according to Larry Muench, Director of Facilities.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nInstead of going to Graham House for counseling or the Academics Skills Center for tutoring, students who find themselves having difficulty focusing can now be referred to the Addison Gallery of American Art to improve their concentration and reduce stress. The Addison Gallery, Academic Skills Center (ASC) collaborated with the Neuroscience and Behavioral group this summer to develop a new self-conducted meditative exercise for easily-distracted students. The exercise involves concentrating on one specific work of art in the Addison Gallery for an extended period of time. The purpose of the activity is to guide students to focus on a single subject without being distracted by outside sources. “The Addison Gallery is a place where students can practice sustained attention, which also results in subtle changes to the brain. Regular meditation, in addition to promoting calmness in the moment, has been shown to help keep us calm in moments of stress,” said Jamie Kaplowitz, Education Associate and Museum Learning Specialist at the Addison. Students can visit the museum on their own at a time of their convenience if they find themselves getting easily distracted, or Cluster Deans can recommend students for the Addison mindfulness exercise in the same way that faculty can suggest Graham House counseling to students, according to Kaplowitz. “If we know that a student struggles, or if a student self-identifies as being hyper-distracted, then maybe an out-of-the-box approach to self-training and self-discipline on that is to go into a quiet space like the Addison and actually practice doing this,” Frank Tipton, Dean of West Quad North and a member of the Neuroscience and Behavior Psychology group. Students who have been referred to the Addison will be asked to submit a reflection on the activity to their Cluster Dean, but the school will not collect notes taken during the actual activity so as to promote uncensored activity. “We’ve created a whole activity which invites a kind of focused experience: looking at a painting and writing down what you’re seeing, thinking about different aspects of it and really staying focused on it—not being distracted by things or texts or friends or what everybody else in the class is doing,” said Tipton. Tipton hopes that both faculty and students will consider this exercise as another on-campus resource for students who struggle with procrastination or lack of focus. The idea was initially conceived by the Phillips Academy Neuroscience and Behavioral Psychology Group, an association of faculty created past Winter term that includes Frank Tipton, Patricia Davison, Amy Patel, Medical Director at Isham Health Center, Jeremiah Hagler, Instructor in Biology, and Carol Israel, Associate Director at Graham House. The group’s primary goal was to develop ideas to further support students in healthy ways, both physically and psychologically. Over summer, the group read extensively on various topics related to adolescent cognition. The group came upon the idea of mindfulness, a strategy of focused meditation or reflection, and reached out to the staff at the Addison Gallery to develop a learning exercise for Andover students, according to Tipton. “Most students are accustomed to the visual literacy skills that we practice when they visit the Addison with a class, but I hope that this mindfulness activity will help guide them through similar explorations on their own time, through an artwork of their choice,” said Kaplowitz. “We are developing some other ideas right now [to enhance concentration]. For example, overall wellness has a tremendous impact on concentration and other elements of the learning process. [The Neuroscience and Behavioral Psychology group] looks forward to great partnership between faculty connected with the future Wellness Center and the Dean of Students Office in pursuit of wellness-related strategies for students who are struggling,” said Tipton.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nEvery month, Andover alumni from around the world reconnect at reunions ranging from on-campus basketball games to dinners in New York and London. Up until her retirement on Thursday, Gail Wozniak, Assistant Director for Alumni Engagement, organized these alumni meet-ups. \n During her 15 years in her role at the Office of Alumni Affairs, Wozniak has worked with Phillips Academy Public Safety (PAPS), the Office of Physical Plant (OPP), Paresky Commons and various other groups on campus to make sure all alumni gatherings run smoothly. \n “The people that I’ve worked with, both on campus and the alumni that I’ve made relationships with over the years, [are] such a wonderful group of people and [are] so dedicated to Andover,” she said.\n Wozniak was in charge of off-campus and weekend reunions and handled alumni events in places such as Chelsea Piers in New York City and Universal Studios in Los Angeles.\n In addition to meeting with faculty and staff, Wozniak was constantly in touch with the Alumni Class Committees to plan large events like 25th and 50th year reunions.\n “[They were] people that wanted to be with each other, kind of like a destination vacation, but yet with Andover being behind it… I just got to go to all of these wonderful places: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Florida, [Washington] D.C., Houston and Dallas. It was just a wonderful opportunity for me to travel,” said Wozniak. \n Putting together a successful reunion involves coordinating many moving parts, but Wozniak will be remembered at the Alumni Office for her skill in pulling these events together. \n “She’s been overseeing reunion weekends for many years, and she’s calm under pressure, because there is always some sort of curveball that is thrown. She knows how to roll with the punches when things get a little crazy,” said Deborah Murphy ’86, Director of Alumni Engagement, who has worked with Wozniak for six years. \n “I will miss most the level of commitment that she brings to the work that she does and the great pride that she takes in her work,” Murphy continued. \n Peter Ramsey, Secretary of the Academy, said, “I think that the fun we’ve had is, in a sense, the pleasure of mutually seeing things done beautifully, done very well and people being excited about them. [An] event at Chelsea Piers for example, years ago, was the first time Andover had an alumni audience of that size outside of school. It was fantastic, and so, I think those are the kinds of things that I remember and that I think that she and I enjoyed.”\n The event at Chelsea Piers in 2000 was Andover’s biggest alumni event, with 800 people in attendance.\n “A number of alums have really been appreciative for the ideas for their reunion weekend celebrations that have come from the meetings and conversations facilitated by Gail. That’s why there are many, many people who are letting her know that they’ll miss her,” Ramsey said.\n After her 15 years at Andover, Wozniak hopes to spend time with her two granddaughters. An avid quilter, she also plans on quilting with her friends. Wozniak signed up for the temporary positions list, so it is not unlikely that the Andover community will see her back on campus in the future.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nJust months before he co-founded the Internet phenomenon Reddit, Alexis Ohanian faced the bitter sting of rejection. His idea for a mobile food ordering app was rejected by Y Combinator, a startup “accelerator” that funds promising new technology ventures. “[Y Combinator] said, ‘If you are willing to kill your company, if you are willing to get rid of ‘My Mobile Menu’ and come up with anything new, we’ll let you in the program because we don’t like the idea, but we like you,” said Ohanian. On this premise, Y Combinator granted Ohanin funding in 2005. On Monday, Ohanian and Jessica Livingston ’89, founding partner of Y Combinator, spoke to students in a casual lunchtime discussion about their experiences working in the fluid world of tech startups. “We are all figuring things out,” said Ohanian. “There is no syllabus, there’s no course agenda, you’re just figuring it out. And if you see someone, whether they are as accomplished as Bill Gates or Jay Z, know that even they at their points of greatness are still figuring things out.” “No one actually knows everything, so do not let ‘I don’t know what I’m doing’ stop you, because in a way sucking is the first step to being good at something… You are going to fail and you’re going to have setbacks, but that’s okay because nobody starts out great,” said Ohanian quoting “Adventure Time,” a popular TV show. Livingston specifically recounted the success of Drew Houston, founder of the popular file hosting service Dropbox. Houston’s idea initially failed to attract investors due to the growing competition for his idea and its narrow market. Regardless, Houston persisted with Dropbox and eventually received 7.2 million dollars in venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, which promoted it from an early-stage startup under Y Combinator to a leader in the field of online cloud storage. “Six years ago, [Houston] was just a dude who wouldn’t shut up, just kept asking questions. Only on the internet can you have that kind of growth and impact,” said Ohanian. Livingston believes that experience and the energy to develop ideas are the most important characteristics for aspiring entrepreneurs, irrespective of educational background. Livingston experienced this firsthand as a self-described mediocre student at Phillips Academy who attended a mediocre college. “There are a lot of gatekeepers in your life. And these people put you on a certain track. I was put on this mediocre track, and I believed it. And that stuck with me for a long time,” said Livingston. With the growing number of startups and the rise of the internet, gaining experience outside of school is even easier, according to Ohanian. Livingston said, “When you graduated back when I did, there were really only two options for you: You could get a job, or you could go to grad school. Now there is the third option, which is doing your own thing. And when I say thing, I refer to lots of things: Startups, nonprofits, lifestyle business, whatever you want.” Ohanian urged Andover students to begin their startup experiences in high school by learning to code and pursuing independent projects they are passionate about. “While you are at Andover, take advantage of learning all you can, meet and do projects with smart people who could someday be your co-founders and try solving your own problems as a way to generate new ideas,” wrote Livingston in an email to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Dec 12, 2013'), ('\nA Tuesday faculty vote has granted teachers more flexibility in writing instructor reports. Written instructor reports are no longer mandated at midterms or the end-of-term, although faculty technically have the opportunity to write reports six times a year. The system therefore neither requires nor restricts teachers to the former three-times-a-year system. \n The goals of allowing the faculty this greater flexibility is as follows, according to a February 2013 memo from John Rogers, former Dean of Studies, on behalf of the Academic Council: \n “These proposals are intended to serve the following goals:\n • Facilitate the work of student teams in supporting students.\n • Ensure more regular, consistent, useful and timely feedback to students and their parents.\n • Help us avoid overlooking students who do not fall within our traditional reporting categories at the various checkpoints throughout the year.\n • Serve as an incentive and reminder in our busy schedules to step back periodically and think deliberately about trends/patterns for each of our students.”\n “I have a lot of faith that teachers here understand that students and parents want to read feedback… It’s really up to teachers what they write. But the grade and the grid will appear at midterm and end of the term. It’s really up to individual teachers consulting with teachers of the same course and with department chairs if and how much they write in the grid text-wise,” said Trish Russell, current Dean of Studies. \n Although she could not disclose the exact tallies, Russell said the vote was extremely close. Many teachers expressed apprehension that under the new system they would feel pressured into writing all six instructor reports – both at midterm and the end of each term – even though it was not required, said Russell. \n The motivation behind the change was to allow flexibility for courses that may function better with midterm reports and for teachers or courses who may choose to write reports at the end of each term, according to Russell. \n By allowing teachers to choose the timing of their reports, Russell says the system allows teachers more time to write their reports than it did in the past, when faculty had only a few days after finals to write all instructor reports for the end of term. \n “We want to be careful not to overload teachers with, ‘Write sixty long reports in two days.’ For teachers who teach four big sections, it’s a lot of work to write prose summaries,” said Russell. \n The faculty also approved the continuation of the online grading system that began this Fall Term as a trial and mandated that all teachers submit midterm and end of term grades and “grids” online.\n The new online “grid” system allows teachers to grade students on academic skills. At the end of term, grids and finalized grades on a 0-6 scale become accessible online to students and parents. \n Note: A previous version of this article had a headline that incorrectly stated that instructor reports are optional. Teachers are, in fact, still required to write instructor reports.

Dale Hurley, current Girls Varsity Crew Coach and Instructor in Mathematics, will assume the role of Interim Director of Andover Crew, wrote Michael Kuta, Director of Athletics, in an email to The Phillipian. \n Kuta said the process of determining other crew coaching assignments is ongoing. “We will need to fill one of the coaching roles by hiring a contract coach. We feel that it is important to be more deliberate with this process to support the crew program at the highest level,” wrote Kuta. \n The reasons for Washburn’s leave of absence are private and unrelated to his health, wrote Farrell. \n “I extend my thanks to the many faculty who have been involved in covering Pete’s assignments, and I sincerely appreciate your understanding that no further information is available,” wrote Farrell in his email.\n Notice of Washburn’s decision was posted on the Andover Crew website on December 6. “The Andover rowing family make[s] up about ten percent of the alumni population.

The project is in a trial phase and will be suspended if it becomes too expensive, if printer stations become messy or if printers cannot be maintained, said Williams.\n “The stapler next to the SamPhil printer has already been stolen… Blue Print is an initiative meant for the entire student body, so it would be unfortunate for incidents of theft to derail its progress,” read Monday night’s email. \n “Specifically, our goal is to make wireless printing available on mobile devices like iPads and iPhones. Furthermore, we’d potentially like to see other buildings receive printers, assuming the current model is sustainable,” said Williams in an interview with _The Phillipian_. \n The three locations were chosen for both their geographic positions on campus and their ability to prevent jams between those printing and those walking along hallways, said Williams. \n “We figured that students would be more likely to have a class requiring printed documents in SamPhil than in buildings like Gelb and Morse. GW was the second clear choice because of the large day student presence on a daily basis. Finally, seeing as almost all students circulate through Paresky Commons, we wanted to place a printer in another heavily-peopled location,” said Williams. \n Dominic Veneto, Director of Technology, and other members of the Technology Department offered technical support before Blue Print’s launch.

I think it was really inspiring to know that these people devoted their entire lives to doing that.”\n**NICOLE QUINLAN ’92**\nNicole Quinlan ’92 arrived at Andover with an acute awareness of the educational opportunity she had been given.\nQuinlan said, “I knew that everyone here was going to succeed, and I knew, ‘Okay, this is a great… opportunity for 1200 people to have an amazing education.’ But that’s 1200 people, out of a student body population of 100 million in this country, and not everyone can get this opportunity. Why is it that if you are so high-achieving that you get this opportunity and if you are just average you get a really crappy opportunity?”\nQuinlan has since devoted her career to social enterprises working to level this educational inequity by closing the “opportunity gap.” She uses a multi-layered approach to entrepreneurship in her work with organizations Citizen Schools and City Year, trying to improve the basic skills of inner-city students in Math and English and to provide them with hands-on learning experiences after school.\nShe developed programs with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Google to pique these students’ interests in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields (STEM) that they would not have been able to participate in without being part of the after-school program.\n“My parents were willing to pay to take me to the museum, my parents were willing to pay for a violin lesson, they were willing to pay to give me all of these amazing achievement opportunities in the after-school hours. If you don’t have the money to pay, how do you get it?” said Quinlan.\n**SUSAN STRATE ’87**\nGrowing up in Andover, Susan Strate ’87 was keenly aware of the economic and racial disparities between Andover and the neighboring town of Lawrence.\n“I remember the ice cream man was from Puerto Rico, and some kids in the neighborhood [made] comments about that, really kind of slurring where he came from. And I think, as a child, many of us start off with a very strong sense of justice, and this instant recognition that, ‘This doesn’t seem right to me. We don’t know this man, and yet you’re picking on him,’” she said.\nThese early experiences inspired her to stop learning Latin at Andover and pick up Spanish in order to better connect with the community she lived next to. At Andover, she pursued her passion for social justice as part of a community service program in which she tutored Lawrence elementary school students. In college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Strate used her Spanish-speaking skills to help immigrants apply for a fuel assistance program.\nAfter college, Strate worked at the Salvation Army’s Social Services sector for eight years. During her time there, she talked face-to-face with over 5,000 people about their economic struggles. Once she established these personal connections, she realized that she could not continue providing short-term solutions for these economic troubles.\n“So most of the work I was doing there was what we in the social service world would call ‘Band-Aid’ work,” said Strate. “I wasn’t teaching anybody how to fish, I was providing a fish for that day because the person in front of me was hungry. And as the person who was distributing funds and sticking to a budget, I realized that I wanted to raise even more money so that I could help more people.”\nAfter leaving the Salvation Army, Strate worked for the Hampshire Community Action Commission as the Director of Community Action Services for four years.\nStrate’s 11 years of experience with grant writing led her to value the importance of an informed discussion about social justice. She strives to help create this conversation in her current capacity as Population Estimation Programs Manager at University of Massachusetts Donahue’s Public and Economic Policy Department.\n“Working with grant writing, I also realized that if you collect better data and know how to use that data, you can make a much stronger argument.

I love to have fun, am outgoing and easy going and am imaginative, so it’s easy to brainstorm events and roll with the punches. Being medically trained doesn’t hurt either,” said Wong.\n A lover of the outdoors, she hopes to focus on integrating more outdoor programs into student life. \n “[We are] trying to figure out how to bring the outdoors here to this campus [because students] can’t pack up and go to New Hampshire for a day,” said Wong. \n While attending the Andover public schools as a child, Wong said she detected a rift between the Town of Andover and the school, something she hopes to bridge as Student Program Coordinator. \n “Growing up, Phillips Academy was kind of like this big black hole of these rich smart kids,” said Wong. “I didn’t know any of them. It’s ironic that I ended up finding myself working here and [the students] are the nicest, kindest, [most] considerate young adults.”\n Wong hopes to get kids “plugged into” all that the Town of Andover has to offer. \n “If I were a 16-year-old student, what would I do with [my free] time? We plan from there and it’s kind of a trial-and-error process… [We] try to find that fine line of adulthood and still being a kid,” said Wong.\n “I like to think that I can be on the fine line of adult versus friend, and I think that I have been very approachable. A lot of kids approach me as an equal. I like getting to know as many students as I can,” said Wong. \n She first discovered her love for youth development by working for the Town of Andover’s Youth Services (AYS) since 2006. Wong still works as a Senior Staff member for the AYS summer programs, which focus on bringing middle and high school students on trips hiking, snowboarding, white-water rafting, indoor skydiving, spa-days and paintball, said Wong. \n “Working at AYS has definitely set me up for being able to organize student events and knowing what young adults want to do with their time, other than studying every weekend,” said Wong. \n Wong said that the largest differences between Andover and AYS is that at AYS, she was constantly planning trips, whereas at Andover, she works to bring outside sources to the school.\n Wong attended University of Massachusetts Amherst and graduate school at the University of Arkansas, where she worked in sports medicine with the University of Arkansas’ football team.

Niswarth is a summer program where participants spend three weeks during the summer engaging in projects that deal with urban development and education in India. The program “brings together people and ideas from across the globe. It focuses on multiple perspectives, it works to identify and understand context and it digs into the complexity of pressing issues within communities,” according to its mission statement. Up until this point, the Niswarth Program brought only Andover students to India. He hopes that the addition of Exeter students will broaden the scope of the program. “I think Exeter teachers, as well as Exeter students, will bring new perspectives to the program. Part of the program is to reflect on our own communities, so now we will be reflecting on both the Andover community as well as the Exeter community,” said Mundra. “I have seen a great impact when students come back into the Andover community,” he continued. “I wonder what experiences will be like with this first group of Exeter students. It will be interesting how students from both schools integrate their experiences into their curriculums, into their service programs and into their communities.” Laura Marshall, Director of Studies at Exeter, said, “It is a great way for us [Andover and Exeter] to develop a deeper appreciation and respect for one another. I imagine that the friendships that will develop will continue beyond high school.” Marshall led a trip of ten students and ten faculty to India last March as part of a co-learning trip. “After my return from India, after having had time to absorb and reflect upon my experiences there, I realized that I wanted to return to India and I wanted the experience to still be educational, but I yearned for a community service component. I felt very fortunate when the Niswarth opportunity became a possibility, as it is exactly what I was seeking,” said Marshall. Mundra said that he is excited to collaborate with Andover’s rival. “I was just a part of a big football game against Exeter, and I think we compete hard, and the reason we compete hard is because we have deep respect for each other. This camaraderie fuels the rivalry.” “I want to now use that level of camaraderie and the standards that are similar in both communities to come together for a service learning program. The possible collaboration between the two schools can be equally as intense as the rivalry can be between the two schools,” continued Mundra. The idea for collaboration was discussed at a dinner last spring, where Andover Niswarth participants met with the Exeter students who went to India last Spring Break, according to Mundra.\n\n', 'Nov 14, 2013'), ('\nIn response to growing faculty frustration with Blackboard, the Academic Committee on Technology is considering replacing it with a more intuitive Learning Management System (LMS) by 2015. “You could have this conversation at almost any school that is choosing Blackboard, and you’d find a general level of dissatisfaction with the tool… So the fact that it’s still here is just a testament to the fact that people are willing to tolerate something instead of to change away from it,” said Dominic Veneto, Director of Information Technology. Andover is considering switching to the Canvas or Haiku systems, according to Veneto. Canvas is the most widely used LMS within the Eight Schools Association, a group including Andover and its peer schools. Christopher Odden, Instructor in Math, is using Canvas to construct Andover’s online calculus course in collaboration with Lawrence High School. Both Canvas and Haiku give faculty more flexibility with course management, said David Mallick, Intranet Manager. “[In Blackboard,] it’s hard to find things, and it’s hard to search across the various tabs that we have… People say that it’s just a lot of clicking. It’s built upon older technology, and it just doesn’t have some of the stuff that a lot of people are used to, like just being able to drag a file from the browser window and have it download,” said Mallick. Teachers have been trying to find ways to work around Blackboard since the school started using it in 2005. Odden maintains his own website outside of the Blackboard system for his Math 590 students. “I found it easier to administer that site than to use Blackboard because it allows me to use my desktop operating system for the process in a natural way, as opposed to clicking through everywhere in sight,” said Odden. Peter Drench, Instructor in History and Social Science, has maintained a detailed daily assignment calendar for his history classes on a separate website since 2006. “The site is more dynamic,” said Drench. “As we do new things, we can add and subtract… The thing is that Blackboard gives you the connection: The school fills it with students, every class has one. So [Blackboard] just happens to be a handy container. But in effect, I have compromised by setting up the website inside of Blackboard. It is functionally a website.” In 2012, Yasmine Allen, Instructor in Spanish, began using Wikispaces, a site where teachers can create and customize educational websites, as an alternate site that can be easily updated and shared with students and other teachers. “With Blackboard, I found that having to copy and paste [class materials] from year to year from archived courses… took up a lot of time that I wanted to use on planning classes. So I just created the Wikispaces site, and everything was up there and ready to go without me having to go in and actually set it up every term,” said Allen. The Academic Committee on Technology meets once every two weeks to discuss the future of technology in teaching.

Datatel’s limitations have forced Andover to buy over 32 additional applications in order to meet the needs of various academic departments that the default system had failed to address. One of these is Lotus (IBM) Notes, a business management system that provides email, calendars and contact applications. \n “A good information management system should reflect the communities need for timely information, analysis, and reporting,” said Veneto, Director of Information and Technology.\n Lotus Notes, in addition to other applications used with Datatel, is built in such an old computer language that it is nearly impossible to find technical support for, according to Veneto.\n In order to make data management more efficient, Andover has been pursuing the Information Management and Academy Exchange initiative (iMAX) in order to “[create] a holistic approach to information management, business processes and working relationships,” said Veneto.\n A working group of 22 Andover faculty and administrators have requested proposals, identified a variety of vendors and met with them for review. A pilot program will launch in February 2014, said Veneto, although he could not disclose the vendor. \n In addition to updating to a new management system, the iMAX initiative will allow department members to brainstorm with each other more easily. \n “[Information] should flow through the academy so that people have opportunities to interact with it. Currently it doesn’t work that way. We interrupt information more than we interact with it. So the iMax initiative will really offer the Academy an opportunity to have better interactions with the information as it flows through,” said Veneto.\n The iMax initiative will hopefully pull together information from numerous small projects—such as the “Grades and Comments” section on PANet, the Admissions Office’s electronic review of applications and the use of iPads at the Athletic Trainers’ office—and combine them into one integrated system.\n The Technology Office, as part of the iMax initiative, also hopes to add to the “Parent Portal” to allow parents to view their children’s grades and teacher comments.\n\n', 'Nov 14, 2013'), ('\nIn a township of Cape Town, South Africa, the naked body of Eudy Simelane, one of South Africa’s foremost female soccer players, was found in a ditch in April 2008. She had been raped and stabbed 25 times. Farris Peale ’14, as this year’s Lorant Fellowship recipient, recounted Simelane’s story at All-School Meeting. \n Peale, as part of the Lorant Fellowship program, which gives a project grant of up to $5,000 to a member of the Upper class, spent three and a half weeks over the summer in Cape Town, South Africa, working with Ndumie Funda, the founder of Luleki Sizwe, a non-profit organization supporting victims of corrective rape in the townships surrounding Cape Town. \n Peale found that Simelane was just one of about 5,000 victims of corrective rape, a hate crime in which an attacker rapes a gay woman in an effort to change her sexuality, in Cape Town each year. \n “No matter our values, whether we believe in gay marriage or believe that gay people can be cured, a fundamental truth remains. No one deserves to be raped and murdered. Rape is rape. And it is happening everywhere. And all of us, if we try, have the power to fight that evil,” said Peale.\n “The thinking of the attackers goes like this: If a lesbian woman is raped, she will learn to be straight. Lesbian women must be raped so they can become normal again,” she added.\n In addition to being affected by poverty and racism, the lesbian occupants of the townships near Cape Town live in constant fear of being attacked with little chance of protection by the corrupt police force. \n Funda, who grew up in the nearby townships, started Luleki Sizwe after her close friend and fiancée were both killed in corrective rapes. \n “Over the past year, we, as a community, have struggled to define leadership. To me, Ndumie is the face of true leadership. When faced with a problem she could no longer ignore, Ndumie stood up in the face of possible death to fight for her beliefs. That bravery, that willingness to question… is what leadership is,” Peale said. \n Although corrective rape still prevails in South Africa, organizations such as Luleki Sizwe have made progress in the fight for gay and lesbian rights through protesting. \n Funda also created a Change.org petition to press government officials to act, receiving more than 175,000 signatures from people in more than 163 countries. Following her petition, the South African government actively spoke out against corrective rape, announcing on September 1 that they would introduce anti-hate crime legislation for the first time. \n “By involving herself and other lesbians in charity work, [Funda] also helps change the stereotypes about lesbians being evil and demonic. Instead, they are seen as normal and even giving members of the community,” said Peale. \n The terrors of corrective rape are not limited to South Africa. According to the United Nations and the Annual Survey of International Law, corrective rape has recently been reported in Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Thailand, Brazil, Honduras, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the U.S. and many more countries around the globe. \n Peale chose to work with Luleki Sizwe after learning about the organization on the Internet. \n “I knew about some larger organizations, but I decided to work with a smaller organization because there’s something different about gaining authentic experience working with someone actually from the area,” Peale said.\n The Lorant Fellowship program honors three students in the Upper class who display “earnest endeavor” and allots up to $5,000 in funding for one student to go to Africa, the Middle East or Europe over the summer to learn more about an aspect of those cultures.\n\n', 'Nov 14, 2013'), ('\nWhen Iman Masmoudi ’14 traveled to Tunisia this summer, she hoped to better understand what life was like for her parents, who grew up under the dictatorship first of Habib Bourguiba, then of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This became the focus of her Global Scholars project, where she studied the Renaissance Party, a moderate Islamic political party in Tunisia that was created after the fall of dictator Ali.\nAs Andover’s first Global Scholar, Masmoudi discussed what distinguishes the Renaissance Party and Tunisia as a whole from other Arab Spring nations in her presentation titled “The Renaissance Party: Ennahdha’s Model for Political Islam in Post-Revolution Tunisia.”\n“I think what brought me closer to my parents and their culture was researching the dictators that came before the revolution and understanding what life was like for my parents as they were growing up under a dictatorship,” said Masmoudi.\n“[A] lot of times when I was in Tunisia, I was like, ‘Why is this happening? Why can’t people all agree? What’s the problem?’ But understanding the historical context and the psyche that all the Tunisians are bringing to this conversation and this transition was really helpful to me,” said Masmoudi.\nThe Renaissance Party is the first party to successfully establish a government that finds a balance between religion and politics, according to Masmoudi.\nUnlike the previous dictators, the Party adheres to the principles of the “Twin Tolerations,” a doctrine that allows religious citizens to freely express their views within the restrictions of the democratic process.\n“I was interested in the way that the Tunisian identity encompassed being Muslim while being democratic without there being tension as there usually is. It made me really hopeful that if [the Renaissance] Party could create a liberal democracy with their religion intact, then perhaps democracy could spread in the Muslim World,” said Masmoudi in an interview with The Phillipian.\nThe current situation in Tunisia is one of great political and economic tension, as civilians are still learning to voice their opinions in a democracy rather than protest or attempt to overthrow a dictator.\n“While I was in Tunisia, there was a political assassination of Mohamed Brahmi, a prominent opposition man. This revealed a lot of the faults that were undercurrent in Tunisia. There was a lot of fear [and] accusation after this uproar. This really showed me that I had been a little disillusioned with the transition,” said Masmoudi.\nTunisia also faces an unreliable and untrained media. By the end of Ali’s dictatorship, all established journalists had been thrown out. Their replacements lacked professional training and often published erroneous facts or exaggerations, said Masmoudi.\n“For example, this French-Tunisian journalist… basically just took the fact that I attend Andover and wrote an entire article about how my dad must be this wealthy businessman and how the US and the CIA must be funding his operations in Tunisia—all entirely made up, with no basis in fact,” said Masmoudi.\nPart of her research included interviews with politicians from both the Renaissance Party and the opposing party, as well as with civilians. Masmoudi met with Meherzia Laabidi, the Vice President of the Tunisian National Constituent Assembly (NCA).\n“It was so intimidating. The same person who was shaking my hand was also writing the constitution of the country,” said Masmoudi, recounting the exchange.\n“[Talking to civilians] helped me to see the micro-level. When I spoke to the politicians they would use these big words, trying to be inclusive of all Tunisians. But talking to people I could hear their individual concerns about how the current Tunisian state affects their lives,” she continued.\nMasmoudi said that she came to better understand the political situation in Tunisia through her research process.\n“Sometimes when you write a history paper, it feels like what you say doesn’t matter because everyone already knows about it. But this time, [I was] actually a part of something as significant as creating a new government [and] establishing democracy in the Middle East, while it’s happening, [and that] was the most remarkable [thing] for me,” Masmoudi said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n“I hope that people leave this presentation thinking that the Arab Spring isn’t a lost cause, that democracy in the Middle East, in the Muslim World, isn’t a lost cause. There is a possibility of a democracy being created,” she continued.\nThe Global Scholar Program, in its inaugural year, allows selected students to explore global issues and cross-cultural perspectives in topics that interest them through independent summer research.

At the end of these meetings, the schools decided to address their dearth of uncommon languages and their desire to incorporate travel in the curriculum.\n Two students from each school will be offered enrollment in the Arabic online program every year. The course plans to require a two year commitment, as it typically takes two years to get students to transition into college Arabic programs easily, according to Peter Merrill, Interim Chair of the Global Perspectives Group and Instructor in Russian and German. \n “If we did a one year program, we would essentially be leaving the kids on their own,” said Merrill.\n In the past, schools have found it difficult to hire teachers in languages such as Arabic due to low student demand. With an online presence, the ESA hopes not only to generate interest in this unconventional language, but also to eliminate the struggle of finding faculty to teach the course and keep dropout rates low for language classes.\n “[An online course] will be a way to keep some presence of Arabic in the school but not necessarily leading to anything on the Andover campus,” according to Merrill.\n The Arabic program will be limited to students who have already completed their school’s language requirements and to those with particularly strong initiative to handle the difficulty of an online language course.\n Another part of the ESA’s venture will be to create a global water resource course. The course plans to investigate the water quality and trends of the local water sources of each school. Students will compile the data of each water resource and relay it to the ESA for comparison and analysis. \n “The ESA will not just be looking at one watershed area, but they are looking at seven watershed areas and sveeing if the data leads to similar conclusions. It’s just that the more data sets you have, you have a lot more you can understand. Absolutely, the whole point of this program is to share the data,” said Merrill.\n In addition to collecting this data, the online course will aim to analyze the social and political effects of water on the current world. \n “One of the quotes that you will see in ‘The Economist’ is that the next major war will be about water… Battles to the west of the US are to get the water. The Chinese are in the process of damming the five major rivers that run through Southern Asia. All of South Asia is nervous about what the Chinese are doing with their water,” said Merrill. \n In the coming months, administrators from each of the eight schools will review proposals for the two programs and plan to finalize the courses by next fall.\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nTwenty-eight percent of Andover students have had sex, 42 percent have engaged in oral sex and 20 percent are in committed relationships, according to the The Phillipian’s 2013 State of the Academy survey. Despite metrics that indicate a high number of students who are sexually active, no more than seven hours of a student’s Andover career is dedicated to sex education.\n Although no concrete plans have been made for a full sex education course, Andover’s Sex Education working group—a group of faculty created last spring to discuss potential changes to the sex education curriculum at Andover—is currently evaluating and crowdsourcing improvements to Andover’s sex ed program.\n Andover students who enter as Juniors or Lowers receive sex education in one class of Physical Education (PE), three Lower Personal and Community Education (PACE) classes, Biology classes and dorm meetings about room visits, according to Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director of Isham Health Center and member of the Sex Education working group.\n Students who enter as new Uppers, Seniors or Postgraduates (PGs), however, do not attend the PE sex ed class or PACE classes. Additionaly, day students do not take part in the room visiting meetings, which are supposed to offer a safe space to discuss healthy relationships, according to Patel.\n “If we value sex education and sexual health within our community, we have to determine a reasonably consistent way to have people experience that curriculum…I think we owe it to everyone in this school to have those experiences,” said Frank Tipton, member of the Sex Education working group and Dean of West Quad North Cluster.\n Last spring, the working group adjusted the PE sex ed class to encourage discussion about Andover-specific situations. The class now lasts a double period and uses statistics on sexuality at Andover taken from a school-wide health survey, according to Katherine Vozeolas, Director of Nursing at Isham. \n The working group worked with dorms to standardize and broaden the reach of sex ed resources, according to Patel. Last spring, Isham nurses held a second room visit discussion at Stimson House to discuss issues of sex, sexuality and contraceptive services offered by Isham. \n “I think [the Isham talk] was really helpful, because a lot of the times when it’s being led by House Counselor, it’s hard because they’re so involved with your lives, so it was a good balance between getting the information and not actually having the house counselors there,” said Melanie Oliva ’14, a proctor in Stimson. \n Other dorms, including Fuess, are planning a second sex education discussion independent of the sex ed working group to further the conversation on self-respect and sexuality within the dorm. The discussions, conducted in small groups by the proctors, hope to be another comfortable place for students to discuss their questions about sex and sexuality on campus, according to Harry Wright ’14, a proctor in Fuess. \n Sex ed extends beyond the classroom or dorm and into Isham’s clinical realm. Before being prescribed birth control, female students discuss their decision to have or not have sex with an Isham Nurse Practitioner.\n “Some students don’t feel that they can have that conversation with any other adult, and that’s a safe, confidential space for them to do be able to do that. And at the end of the conversation, they might say, ‘I don’t think sex is for me,’ or they might say, ‘I’m really ready and committed and feel really comfortable and sex is the right option for me.’ So whatever choice they make, we want them to make the safest choice possible,” said Patel.\n Patel said that the lack of precedent is the biggest challenge facing the working group.\n Though no formal plans have been made, the administration is considering creating sex ed through requirements in an online sex education course that students could complete in modules, allowing students who enter at any year to take the course.\n “If we might be able to do some of the more biological or the nuts and bolts discussions or education online, then some of that time that teachers and students are in a room together can be used to take that conversation to the next level, ” said Patel.\n Tipton said, “It feels a little bit like we’ve got these puzzle pieces scattered around, and we haven’t yet created a comprehensive image and then we have to pull those pieces together. And by pulling those pieces together, we can also identify what’s missing and we can decide what, as a community, we really care about.”\n Students express need for new program: http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/11/01/letter-editor\n State of the Academy 2013: http://www.phillipian.net/sota13/sections/welcome.html\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nHafsat Abiola ’92 will not shake hands—she will hug.

Hafsat Abiola will not mourn; she will share, she will inspire.\n Abiola’s visit to campus last Wednesday was twofold—she was this year’s Finis Origine Pendet speaker and also a recipient of the Alumni Award of Distinction for her work as a world-recognized civil rights activist\n Abiola founded the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) to continue the fight for democracy in Nigeria. Very quickly, however, KIND narrowed its focus to empower women in politics and society. Today, KIND has provided 4,000 young women with the courage and skill set to become active members of society, according to Abiola. \n Politics run in Abiola’s blood. Her father, Chief Moshood Abiola, was the first democratically elected president of Nigeria. Shortly after his election in 1993, however, a military coup overpowered and imprisoned the president-elect. Just two days before Hafsat’s Harvard University graduation, her mother, Kudirat Abiola, was assassinated for protesting against the military regime that had imprisoned her husband. \n “I do not think they lost,” said Abiola of her parents. “I think of their journey as a spiritual journey. They did not betray themselves. That means their spirits stayed pure… We should be celebrating them, so I’m happy. I’m actually very happy. And I’m proud of them. I think the challenge is to stay true to whatever we believe and I think they did a very good job of that.”\n Abiola’s eyes widened and her smile broadened upon learning of Andover’s near 50:50 ratio of male to female students. When she heard, however, that underlying this ratio is the fact that only four female students have been elected school president since the Abbot-Andover merger 40 years ago, she slouched back in her chair as the harsh reality set in.\n “This is a clear sign that the discrimination against women, or the sense of what women’s natural roles are, is so deeply ingrained,” said Abiola. “They’re so deeply ingrained that, if in a place as privileged as Andover we can still be replicating the same kinds of results that very fundamentalist nations are generating, it already tells you something.”\n “I’m going to tell you a story.”\n The Angolan Civil War, which began in 1975, left the countryside rife with landmines, said Abiola. When the war ended, a team was dispatched to disable the landmines. Although the operation was officially deemed successful, further investigation found that women and children still suffered disproportionately from undiscovered mines. Later, the government found that the team that removed the mines consisted exclusively of men, thus only the mines where men worked, travelled and lived had been mapped and removed. \n “It’s a symbolic example that illustrates what happens when the voices of one group of people, who may have unique experiences, are completely shut out of a system,” said Abiola. “If our system affects both men and women, then we have to make sure that women’s voices, their concerns, their needs, are integrated into the decision-making process.” \n “It’s not possible for Andover to talk about empowering women around the world if they are not empowering women at Andover. You see, sometimes you model the behavior you want… it causes other people to replicate your example.”\n Abiola loved Andover. Andover shaped her personality, built her character. Although she did not know it at the time, Andover would set her on a path that would determine her life today. \n “I think the Andover Bubble is okay if you use that time to prepare yourself for other things, to use that time to take care of yourself and to learn and know yourself… Life is a maturing process. Once you learn that, and you go out into the world, no one can stop you. Nothing can go wrong for you, because no matter what goes wrong you do not betray yourself,” said Abiola.\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nFifteen minutes after the Asian Society meeting started, the chairs that lined the table in Ada’s Room of Paresky Commons remain unfilled.

However, as the sub-demographics within the Asian student population has grown, their needs have varied.\n“When you are talking about 27 percent of students identifying as Asian, Asian American and mixed heritage Asian, there is a huge range in what the needs and interests of these students are going to be,” said Murata.\nAsian Society’s inability to identify the “needs and interests” of the growing Asian and Asian American demographic reflects a growing problem that the\xa0 [Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) office](http://www.facebook.com/CAMDclubs)\xa0faces as a whole.\nThe multicultural community that Andover encompasses has grown to represent 39 countries from 29 in 1997 and 41.5 percent students of color from 25 percent in 1995, according to the Andover website and the 1995 and 1997 Phillips Academy Catalogs. In addition, more than 13 percent of the school now identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ), according to The Phillipian’s 2013 State of the Academy survey. In the face of a more diverse student body, Griffith still believes CAMD plays an important role in creating a community where “students coming from such different backgrounds be able to, one, learn from each other, and on a very basic level, tolerate each other, and ultimately, to be able to respect each other and begin to understand what you have in common as much to understand and accept your differences.” The question CAMD now faces is how foster this multicultural dialogue.\xa0\n_ **A BROADER RANGE OF IDENTITIES** _\nCAMD has struggled to accommodate a more diverse student body through traditional organizations such as Af-Lat-Am and Asian Society, which were, at one time, able to accommodate the majority of Andover students, said Linda Griffith, Dean of CAMD.\nWith the increasing number of students from unique cultural, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, students’ identities are no longer as clearly defined. Thus, students sometimes have trouble fitting into these broad organizations.\n“[Biracial or mixed heritage] students would talk to Ms. Murata or me about that, [saying,] ‘Well I feel that if I go to this organization, I’m only supporting one side of my family. If I go to another affinity group, I feel that I’m supporting the other half of my family, but forgetting the other half. So I choose not to go,’” said Griffith.\nIn order to cater to these different identities, CAMD has had to become more attentive to student needs, creating new affinity groups and offshoots from other larger, more general groups. Mosaic, the mixed heritage or biracial group, stands as a prime example.\nMurata, who also serves as the advisor to Mosaic, traced the group’s origins back to the 1990s, when four or five students decided to start the Interracial Student Association. “The constituency was much smaller than it is today, but there were enough students of mixed heritage who felt that ‘Gosh, my experience is not recognized here, I don’t really have a voice,’” said Murata.\nIn the past ten years, however, the number of students who identify as biracial at Andover has reached eight percent, according to Murata. Around 2005, the number of students identifying as mixed heritage increased dramatically, generating need for the group that has become Mosaic.\n_ **DIVERSITY WITHIN DIVERSITY** _\nAndover has seen diversification within groups that were once considered “homogenous,” which has presented a new challenge for CAMD to adapt to.\n“When I grew up, every Asian person was Chinese. I never even thought about a Korean. Japanese were something about the war when I was studying, you know, history,” said Griffith.\nDiversification within larger demographics, like the Asian student population, led to the formation of IndoPak seven years ago to raise awareness on Indian and Pakistani issues. The formation of IndoPak “speaks to the idea that not all Asians are homogenous,” said Raj Mundra, Faculty Advisor to IndoPak.\n“When I was a teaching fellow in 1991, there were about ten students of South Asian heritage at Andover; now I think there are about 80. I was the first person of South Asian heritage to teach at Andover ever, so I was interested, and the kids were interested in having discussions around our culture and celebrating and bringing awareness to our perspective, our backgrounds to the Andover community,” said Mundra.\nIndoPak is not the only club which has been created as an offshoot of Asian Society. Last year, SEA, Andover’s club for students of Southeast Asian Heritage was created to address the needs of students of Filipino, Thai and Indonesian descent.\nCAMD has recently created more clubs to represent the increasing number of identities, such as Global Nomads, Andover’s club for students who have spent a significant amount of their life in a culture aside from their own, and Women’s Forum, which discusses gender issues.\nCAMD’s creation of new organizations has not been limited to multicultural sphere; to address an increase in spiritual identities, CAMD has developed the Hindu Student Association and Muslim Student Association in the past ten years.\n_ **TENDING TOWARDS THE “ACADEMIC”** _\nCAMD has also struggled to reassert itself as a legitimate extracurricular option in the increasingly busy daily lives of students. Murata noted that many students, pressed for time and energy, feel that CAMD programs—which lack the academic prestige of Math Club or Philomathean Society, for example—are not a good use of their time.\n“Also, over time, I think the demands on students and maybe the pressure in relation to college that kids feel that they have to be involved in different clubs and activities that are more demands on their time. That’s something I have seen over the years, this increasing feeling that I must do this and I must do that and all my extracurriculars need to be somehow academic. Whether that is academic or community service, it has to fulfill some end goal toward the college application, as opposed to just fulfilling one’s particular interests and needs,” said Murata, who also works as a College Counselor.\nTo counter this perception and incorporate multicultural discussion into students’ lives, CAMD has tried to integrate aspects of its programs into classroom and academic settings through the CAMD Scholar program in 2006 and the recently-founded Global Scholar Program, said Griffith.\n“What CAMD wants to see happen is a focus on getting social justice – race, class, and justice – into the academic realm, into the classroom. [Selecting] CAMD scholars is one way of doing it, but we’re still outside [the classroom],” said Griffith.\nThese programs allow driven students to pursue independent research through an application process. This year’s program saw a 19 percent acceptance rate, with six scholars chosen out of 31 applications.\n_ **#CONNECTEDLEARNING** _\nBesides classroom integration, CAMD is also looking at social media as another possible avenue through which people with their own unique identity can connect with other people who identify in the same way, said Griffith.\nCAMD created a Facebook page titled “CAMD Club Communications” on October 10. The page had 109 likes on Thursday afternoon and contains posts highlighting different club events. The Af-Lat-Am Mentoring Program (AMP) also has a Facebook group for mentors and mentees to connect.\n“[The] other piece about social media is two-fold. That’s one of the challenges that [Frank Wu] spoke about. But I think many of you can get what you want through social media. You can get into a group, you’re part of whatever [group of people you may identify with],” said Griffith.\nTwo weeks ago, Frank Wu, Chancellor and Dean of University of California, Hastings College of Law, also spoke about the role of social media in an ever-diversifying world to the Andover community.\nWhile CAMD has only begun its efforts to create a social media presence, it is optimistic about its future possibilities. With greater accessibility and the ability to connect easily with almost anyone, CAMD believes that social media will play a larger role in the office’s ongoing strategy.\n_Note:\xa0All graphs are from\xa0_The Phillipian_’s [2013 Report on the State of the Academy](http://www.phillipian.net/sota13/sections/welcome.html)._\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\n **Tim Brothers: Future of Modern Astrophysical Observatories**\nTim Brothers, a site manager for Wallace Astrophysical Observatory (WAO) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shared his perspective on the evolution and future prospects of modern astrophysical observatories. “In the nature of our field, we have to go to a lot of different places all over the world and take data, but we don’t have enough manpower. One thing we need to do is collaborate more, especially now that resources are scarce.” Brothers explained the capabilities and specifications of equipment available at the WAO, such as the 16- and 24-inch telescopes housed in its observatory.\nBrothers’ visit was hosted by the Modern Physics Forum and Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics. Odden hoped that Brother’s presentation would inspire students to undertake similar astrophysics oriented projects.\nIn the future, Andover students may also have the opportunity to engage in some of the projects conducted by the WAO, according to Brothers. “There’s always room for collaboration. I think it would be an interesting opportunity for the students at Andover to learn more about astronomy and for us to gather valuable research data,” he said in an interview with The Phillipian.\nGabor Furesz: Building the Giant Magellan Telescope\nThis past Tuesday, Gabor Furesz, Instrument Physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for the Department of Astrophysics, addressed members of the Andover community about the inner dynamics of building the Giant Magellan Telescope. He spoke about how the required technique and the necessary type of technology for this telescope has developed over the past four centuries.\n\xa0\n“I wanted to show a side of astronomy that is different from the scientific aspect that, I believe, people mostly think about. That very significant other side of [astronomy] which is engineering and building things,” said Furesz.\n“And lots of the people who are in high school are looking for what they are going to do next… in order to make that choice you have to see many sides of whatever is out there. So those interested astronomy and the technology might see a connection and find it intriguing to follow that path,” Furesz continued.\nFuresz emphasized the importance of the telescope’s lense and the role of modern science in its technological development. The Magellan Telescope project, which receives funding from multiple institutions, will cost a total of $800 million.\n\xa0\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nHead of School John Palfrey announced last Friday that the new wellness center will be named after Becky Sykes, former Associate Head of School.\n The Board of Trustees unanimously voted in support of the building dedication on Friday morning. Palfrey announced the naming of the Rebecca M. Sykes Health and Wellness Center at the Trustee, Faculty and Alumni Council Dinner to a standing ovation. \n “I was shocked and immediately dissolved in tears. My husband and Mrs. Chase had to remind me to breathe. The announcement was totally unexpected and beyond my wildest dreams,” wrote Sykes in an email to The Phillipian.\n Construction of the wellness center, intended to promote both emotional and physical health education, will begin in September 2014 and is expected to finish by December 2015. It will be located on Salem Street between Benner House and Bulfinch Hall. \n Sykes, who received the McKeen Award last spring, was a proponent for greater diversity during her 40-year tenure at Andover, pushing for equal-opportunity policies for underrepresented students in her numerous positions on campus. She was also instrumental in the foundation of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and the Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP). She began as a switchboard operator in February of 1973, eventually moving up to serve as Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), Social Functions Director, House Counselor, Abbot Cluster Dean and, ultimately, Associate Head of School.\n “I have had the privilege to be here all 40 years that she was here,” said Elizabeth Parker Powell ’56, trustee emerita and executive committee member of the Andover Development Board. “I think putting the name on the infirmary was a beautiful, meaningful, more than a gesture. It was really a recognition for what she had done for the school for those 40 years.”\n The new Wellness Center will be one of the few spaces on campus named for a woman and the only one named for an African-American woman. “While the naming is a tremendous acknowledgement of one individual, it is also a great symbolic gesture to `reflect how diverse the community has become over time,” said Sykes.\n In September, Sykes departed Andover to become the first President of the Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation. She and her husband, Elwin Sykes, faculty emeritus, have spent three weeks at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa (OWLAG) and flew in specifically for Friday night’s dinner. \n “I am taking a tip from Mr. Palfrey’s first year by doing a lot of listening,” wrote Sykes of her new position. “The school is the single most important initiative that is supported by the foundation.” \n Sykes overviews the strategic vision of the school, which is to provide an excellent university preparatory program for girls from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. \n “Now that we have been on the campus for three weeks, I can immerse myself in all aspects of school life,” Sykes said. “Just before we left town eight days ago, we attended a small local fair at which the school’s marimba band played. I’ve also observed students make presentations on business and attended arts performances.”\n Many of the girls at OWLAG have difficult family circumstances and the foundation works to provide moral and financial support to help them complete both high school and university, continued Sykes. “I was responsible for all the areas of student life when I was at Andover. The work we do in student life in Phillips Academy and at OWLAG is essentially the same—it complements the academic program and makes it possible for students to focus on their studies,” said Sykes.\n Sykes is already in the midst of coordinating wellness workshops for OWLAG students and faculty to occur on their campus this July. The workshops will be the first phase of the leadership program Sykes will develop. “The workshops are meant to help students develop and refine coping mechanisms. These skills are important for anyone, but especially for those with leadership aspirations,” said Sykes.\n Palfrey has yet to name a successor to fill the position of Associate Head of School since Sykes’s departure. \n Calling Sykes “irreplaceable” in an interview with The Phillipian last spring, Palfrey said, “I think that when anybody has been here for 40 years and done such as amazing job as Mrs. Sykes has, the job sometimes comes to describe the individual or to be built upon the individual strengths of that person.”\n “I will always be indebted to all in the Andover community for what they have taught me, but none more than the generous donors who have and will give selflessly to a project to which they were entitled to affix their own names.

He is a recipient of this year’s Andover Alumni Award of Distinction. \n Church is known mostly for his co-discovery of the first instrument for reading and writing DNA sequences. Church also helped initiate the Human Genome Project, an international research effort to map all human genes.\n Church arrived at Andover from a school with very few athletic opportunities and no extracurriculars. “When I came to Andover, I was behind quite a bit, so much so that I had to repeat ninth grade. But, by the time I left, I was two years ahead because of all the AP courses, as well as the independent studies that I did while at Andover. Essentially, I went from one year behind to two years ahead,” said Church. \n Wasting no time, Church began his first independent project in computer science, then called Applicational Math, in his Junior year.\n Church’s independent academic pursuits defined his Andover career. He did another independent study in computer science during his Upper year and independent projects in both chemistry and biology during his Senior year.\n “When I got to college, I just started skipping classes and continuing to research on my own,” said Church. “My studies at Andover are one of the reasons that I went to graduate school after only two years of college, and I started writing papers within two years of leaving Andover. Andover was a very transformative experience, one could say.”\n Clayton Betford, former Instructor in Math and Wrestling Coach, was Church’s greatest influence while at Andover. Church dedicated his Ph.D. thesis to Betford.\n Church learned the importance of teamwork by running cross country and track, wrestling and cycling, for all four years. “Before Andover, I was more dependent on teachers and parents and less dependent on fellow students. I was less of a team player,” said Church. \n After graduating Andover in 1972, Church enrolled at Duke University. Focusing his energy on independent research instead of classes, he left Duke after two years. Church authored enough publications to attend graduate school at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard while studying with Wally Gilbert, who had won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980 according to Nobelprize.org.\n As a professor at Harvard Medical School, Church said his favorite part of his job is interacting with students, helping them plan experiments and analyze results. He is currently developing ways of encoding information like videos into envelopes of DNA.\n “If I had to choose out of all the disciplines, I would choose interdisciplinary,” said Church. “The individual disciplines are just too limiting. In our lab what we are good at, is not any one individual discipline, but rather the integration of different disciplines.”\n Church continued, “I am not particularly good at any one small subject, but I am fairly good at bridging subjects—for example, bridging optics and stem cells.”\n Church was not on campus to receive the award at the ceremony held last Friday, as he was travelling in Asia. He plans to visit campus sometime in the near future.\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nPolice have recovered two weapons that were stolen from an FBI SWAT vehicle parked in Andover yesterday morning or Wednesday evening, police officials said.

The Board of Trustees, the Alumni Council, the Andover Development Board (ADB) and the Annual Giving Board (AGB) each convened individually throughout the weekend to explore the development of the new Strategic Plan, discuss the construction of the Rebecca M. Sykes Health and Wellness Center and engage in conversation with students and alumni. “This past weekend was one of the most jam-packed ever in terms of events, meetings, receptions and more casual opportunities to engage with students, faculty and fellow alumni,” said Tracy Sweet, Director of Academy Communications, in an email to The Phillipian. The Strategic Planning process was the focus of several presentations and meetings during the weekend, including a joint session of the Board of Trustees and the Andover Development Board. “[Strategic Planning] is a very transparent and collaborative process, and what we really need right now is for students in particular to take very seriously the request for information,” said Corinne Field ’83, three-year alumni trustee and Strategic Planning Committee member. “We’re really asking you where you would like to see this school in three or five years,” she continued. The trustees also used the weekend to update the community on the progress of the new Rebecca M. Sykes Wellness Center, to be completed by December 2015. The Board looked at plans drawn up and presented by representatives from Shepley Bulfinch, a design company. They confirmed plans to move forward with architectural renderings featuring geothermal heating and cooling as well as a green roof and an energy dashboard. “A preliminary design has been approved for the wellness center. They got the program together, building designs, and we’re now in the fundraising stage,” said Robert Campbell ’66, a two-year charter trustee. The goal of the Board of Trustees is to achieve the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) energy silver certification for the new wellness center. Peter Currie ’74, newly-appointed president of the Board of Trustees and ten-year charter trustee, said that this weekend was centered on creating more opportunities for the trustees to meet with more groups of faculty and students. One of such groups of students were those who participated in global programs in the past year. The ADB and the trustees met with students who went to Niswarth, BASK in ASK, HUACA, South Africa and Arts, Brazil PLACES and Russian language immersion in order to hear about the impact of off-campus educational experiences. A small group of female alumni and trustees also met with the Girls’ Leadership Project to discuss gender matters on and off campus. The women at the event sparked conversation about the Andover/Abbot Academy merger. Elizabeth Powell AA’56 was a charter trustee for 20 years. She became a trustee in 1980 and was the second female to join the Board of Trustees. Upon returning to campus, Powell noted the differences between Trustees’ Weekend now and 30 years ago, highlighting the progress that Andover has made in the past three decades since the merger. “This weekend was just huge in welcoming back Andover and Abbot people and in re-engaging them, so to speak, trying to bring them up to date, and let them see what Andover is now in 2013,” said Powell. On Saturday morning, the Distinguished Service Award was awarded to Henry Cho ’83, Susan Urie Donahue ’73, John Kane ’63, Kuni and Michael Schmertzler ’70, Constance Wright and David Stoldt P’07 ’09 and ’12 and Yichen Zhang ’82, according to an Andover press release. The Distinguished Service Award is presented annually to alumni who showed exceptional commitment to Andover in various ways that include playing a philanthropic role, community building or volunteer service. “This award is our most important award for the Andover volunteers. Each year we give the award to five or six individuals or couples who demonstrate the spirit of non sibi by giving back of time, treasure, and talent,” said Tom Beaton, newly appointed Alumni Council president and first year trustee. The dinner hosted on Friday night ended with the announcement of the dedication of the new wellness center to Becky Sykes, former Associate Head of School, and the celebration of exceptional teachers and retiring trustees. Instructorships and foundations, each generously supported by endowed funds, were presented at the dinner by Pat Farrell, Dean of Faculty.

By the look of the half-finished cigar he held in his left hand, he had been watching for a while. The earthy smell clung to his words even after the cigar’s smoke had dissipated.\n Stella is a leading abstract artist. His Wikipedia page will tell you that he is one of the “most well-regarded postwar American painters still working today,” that his work in abstract expressionism and modernism is pioneering, that he was awarded a National Medal of the Arts by President Barack Obama in 2009. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art names him as the source behind the phrase, “What you see is what you see,” that served as the genesis of modern minimalism.\n Stella was on campus Friday to receive the Andover Alumni Award of Distinction, given annually to Phillips and Abbot Academy alumni who have “served with distinction in their fields of endeavor.” Stella did not seem fazed to join a list that includes President George H.W. Bush ’42, William Knowles ’95, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and, this year, Hafsat Abiola ’92 and George Church ’72. Rather, he regarded his return to campus with a sort of humorous nostalgia.\n “It is a little different,” he said. “I have been back a few times before, but this time, I really feel old. I really can’t hide it.”\n Stella graduated from Andover in 1954 as a “pretty average student” in all aspects but wrestling, where he excelled as an integral part of the team. “I spent as much time playing sports as I did making art. I was not really part of the artsy community.”\n After struggling with “low-level delinquency” at his old school, Stella said his parents shipped him off to Andover as “a punishment.” After unknowingly impressing the school’s wrestling coach at a practice prearranged by his father, Stella applied and was accepted.\n He adjusted quickly to a lifestyle at Andover that he described as “a little hazier, a little looser” than it is today. He still remembers the house master of his dorm, who “wrote home to my father that I was a ‘potential bomb-thrower.’” \n However, it was at Andover where Stella cultivated an interest in painting that stemmed from his mother, who was an artist, and his father, who worked as a house painter. “The material of paint was easy for me. I could just mess around, I didn’t feel self conscious about it.”\n Stella most appreciated the space that Andover gave him to explore painting, and pursued the “Art Major.” He spent his mornings in Art History classes and his afternoons in the studio twice a week. “Everyone was so pressured to get certain grades, so you never took courses that you couldn’t get a decent grade in, and that probably changed my life at Andover. In art they didn’t give you a reign, so I was free to do what I pleased.”\n Andover’s art program set the stage for the abstract work he would explore later, said Stella. The curriculum then was based on the theories of Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, two major influences in modern-day art pedagogy.\n “They covered the whole spectrum as far as abstraction was concerned,” said Stella. “Albers was a paragon of geometric abstraction and Hofmann was an insanely gifted teacher and a wildly successful painter. So you had the hard and the soft, you had it all.”\n This comprehensive education in abstraction allowed Stella to work through the block of realistic depiction with which many artists struggled at the time. “First you studied art, then you made realistic paintings, then you went to abstraction. It wasn’t that way for me. I was just in it,” he said. \n In retrospect, his five-decade-long career seemed to follow a natural path for Stella. “The trend towards abstraction was a demarked historical event,” he said. “I think it has to do with the history of all ideas in the 19th century, and I guess you have to say it had to do then with the 18th century and so on, because each century before affected the next one. All of the ideas blended together at the beginning of the 20th century into modernism.”\n What’s next? Stella isn’t sure. “Now in the 21st century it is not very clear what the trajectory of art is going to be and it won’t necessarily follow that line. However it goes, it will be something else.” \n “Andover just gives you that slick confidence, and I don’t know if it is merited or not, for making your way through the world,” he said. “I wasn’t that ambitious and I was in the right place at the right time. I was fairly lucky in the beginning. I was really only one of many young artists, many of whom were friends of mine. The older generation of artists were amazingly receptive, I mean, to the whole group of us.”\n In spite of his overwhelmingly successful career, Stella still staunchly believes that “the audience for art is the person who makes it.” He said, “It has to go by you first. Then, whatever else happens after that is okay, it is not serious. It may affect your lifestyle or what you have to do, but everyone has to do something.”\n\n', 'Nov 7, 2013'), ('\nDr. Richard Keller, former Medical Director at Isham Health Center, pleaded guilty to two counts of receiving and one count of possessing child pornography in a court hearing on Monday, November 5.

[The acronym] reflects the multidisciplinary nature of what we are going to be doing with the students,” said Vidal. \n Although no knowledge of Portuguese is necessary, all students planning to participate in PLACES will be required to complete Brazilian Cultural Studies, a term-contained interdisciplinary course taught by Vidal and Peter Cirelli, Instructor and Chair in Music, that focuses on literature, film, art and music from 19th-century and 20th-century Brazil, according to Vidal. Because students from all grades can audit Brazilian Cultural Studies, underclassmen will have an equal opportunity to enroll in the class and ultimately participate in PLACES. \n “We realize that when students go to a place without knowing anything, it can take away from the experience. The program isn’t just about coming and experiencing culture, but [about] participating in an academic, intellectual experience that starts on campus, then continues in the country where they can explore what they have learned on a more personal level,” she said. \n The program was organized by Vidal, Peg Harrigan, Instructor in Art, and Anna Milkowski, Instructor in Biology, all of whom are part of the Brazil Faculty Learning Community. \n The idea for the program arose when the Global Perspectives Group organized and sponsored a series of seminars for faculty professional development, in which the faculty had the opportunity to investigate a particular topic in 2010. \n “Because Brazil is such an important country in the world, economically, politically and culturally, and because global programming gave us an opportunity to [explore] areas that we hadn’t focused on before up until now, we felt that it was our responsibility to start thinking about ways in which we can make our students more familiar with Brazil,” Vidal said. \n Following the seminars, a group of faculty formed the Brazil Faculty Learning Community to together develop their interest in Brazil through readings, discussion and participation in events related to Brazil in the Boston area, according to Vidal. \n Harrigan said, “[Brazil] is culturally important and fitting in the global economy. It also has abundant resources and it’s important to be aware of sustainable practices that will preserve the natural resources like the Amazon itself. We have a responsibility to be mindful of how places can be sustained for future generations.” \n Although the exact itinerary is yet to be decided, the program will likely span two to three weeks. Students will travel to cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Piracicaba and Xapuri, documenting their experiences through writing, data collection, interviews and video and photography, according to the program description on the Andover website. \n This year, donations from the Class of 1959 will fund the trip. Applications for the program will be released mid-December, and they will be due shortly after winter break. Financial aid will be offered to students who qualify.\n\n', 'Oct 31, 2013'), ('\nIn the spring of 1968, Abbot Academy was searching for its 18th and final headmaster. Out of 61 applicants, Don Gordon ’52 stood out as an Andover alumnus with high hopes for the school’s future. Gordon, the final Principal of Abbot Academy before the Phillips-Abbot Merger of 1973, visited campus last week to recount his experience at Abbot Academy before and during the merger with Andover. During his first two years at Abbot, Gordon said he faced much opposition as principal, partly due to his sex and partly due to his role in the merger of Abbot Academy and Andover. “I was an instrument of PA, but at the same time I had to be responsible for the health and welfare of Abbot Academy. In a weird sense, I was being asked to ready the bride for a wedding that the bride might not want,” Gordon said. Leading up to the merger, Gordon, with Philip Allen ’29, the Abbot board chairman who also supported coeducation, began coordinating coeducational classes, with Abbot girls taking classes on Phillips’ campus, and vice versa. “I loved working [at Abbot] because I knew I had the opportunity, not just to defend women, but to help educate them. That is much more fun than I can express,” Gordon said. “I believed in the absolute irreducible inequality in every respect of the sexes and I privately despised many of my colleagues [at Andover] in those days because so many of them were male chauvinists and I simply could not abide that,” Gordon said. As one of only two male faculty members at Abbot, Gordon worked to create a gender-balanced faculty. “I knew I had to make some administrative changes, and that meant letting some faculty go while being disliked by some,” he continued. Gordon recognized the challenges that faced his female students. “You are going to have to be civilized and brave. [The world] is full of dangers. It is outrageously beautiful, but the man-made world, as well as the jungle, is a pretty rough place and you have to be confident, strong and opinionated,” said Gordon to the student body during his first speech as Principal of Abbot. As principal, Gordon also established a student-led “town meeting” system for school policy changes, a move considered progressive at the time. The town meetings abolished Abbot’s dress code, allowed students to skip Sunday church and even considered eliminating grades at the school, according to “A Singular School’ by Susan Lloyd. “Several Seniors came to my office within a week, and said, begged me to do something about the tie-shoes rule. They had to wear tie shoes 24/7 and I was horrified. And I didn’t want to behave like a despotic popentate, not at all, it’s not my style, but I had to do something about these things,” said Gordon.

Abiola’s father, Moshood Abiola, the president-elect of Nigeria, died two years later while imprisoned by the military regime he was challenging. Inspired by her parents’ efforts to promote democracy, Abiola has since taken up the fight for civil rights in Nigeria.\n Abiola, this year’s Finis Origine Pendet Speaker, spoke at All School Meeting (ASM) on Wednesday about her journey from studying at Andover to advocating for democracy in Nigeria.\n Eight years before her mother’s assassination, Abiola left Nigeria to attend Andover, completely unsure of what her future held.\n “My mother brought me [to Andover] on the first day of school to start classes. Right away I felt like I made a mistake when I had decided to come. I had never been amongst so many white people in my entire life, coming from Nigeria where [we] all kind of look like me,” said Abiola, laughing in her speech. \n It was not until later that Abiola started to find her place and passions in her new school and country. \n “I fell in love with learning here because I felt like there was more interest in me as a student coming here; [people were interested] in my ideas. I had teachers who were interested in what I had to say and in me as a person, and that, for me, was such a beautiful thing,” said Abiola. \n “At Andover, I fell in love with history because I fell in love with the people I met in history. I fell in love with Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and I decided that those people were as alive to me as the people I was seeing in everyday life,” said Abiola in her speech.\n At Andover, Abiola gained confidence to express her views. “I felt safe to be who I could [at Andover] and to tune in to my own inner values, which helped me a lot since I graduated,” said Abiola.\n Abiola credited Rebecca Sykes, former Associate Head of School and then-Dean of Abbot Cluster, for taking her under her wing, helping her adjust to and nurturing her at Andover. \n “My mom took me [to a meeting in my cluster] and we saw Mrs. Sykes, who was a black woman. My mother took my hand and took me to Mrs. Sykes and said ‘I am going to hand over my daughter to you.’ She received what my mother did without panic, which still surprises me until today. Mrs. Sykes took my hand and she always was faithful to that promise.” \n Abiola said that 25 years later, Sykes is still her mentor and has cared for her and upheld her promise, even after her mother’s assassination.\n After Andover, Abiola attended Harvard College and was a freshman there during her father’s presidential election in 1993. After Moshood Abiola won the election, however, the previous president refused to acknowledge his victory. \n The Nigerian military tried to negotiate with him, offering him money in exchange for his abdication. Instead, Moshood Abiola declared himself the rightful democratic leader of the country. The military arrested him within 30 days and charged him for treason; he passed away in prison after four years in solitary confinement, said Abiola.\n “[After my father’s imprisonment] I knew you had to fight for what you want. You have to keep your eyes on the prize, and the prize for us in Nigeria at the time was that we should have a democratic system. We had to do whatever we needed to do to fight for the end of military rule,” said Abiola in her speech.\n During her time at Harvard, Abiola spoke at the city council in Cambridge and then all over the United States, advocating for Nigerian democracy. “[I was] pushing for the American government help us pressure the Nigerian government to give up power and transfer to democratic rule,” said Abiola. \n Just two days before Abiola’s graduation, her mother was assassinated en route to a demonstration. In honor of her mother’s memory, Abiola founded the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND). The group aims to end violence against women in Nigeria and help Nigerian women participate in public life, according to the organization’s website.\n “If you want to solve a problem, you have to go into the midst of the problem,” she said. \n “Finis Origine Pendet,” one of Andover’s mottos, translates from Latin as “the end depends on the beginning.” The Finis Origine Pendet program invites Andover alumni back to the school to speak at ASM. Speakers reflect on their beginnings at Andover and on their careers.\n “[Finis Origine Pendet] means that the way we start really makes a big difference in our lives. When I was in China doing my masters, there was something they used to talk about called path of dependency, that you could become path-dependent. Because my parents became involved in trying to bring political change about in Nigeria, it could create a situation where I think of politics naturally as a way in which I want to make my contribution,” said Abiola in an interview with The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 31, 2013'), ('\nLast February, Miranda Pakozdi, a professional video-gamer, was sexually harassed by her fellow teammates and coach at the Cross Assault video game tournament. Following the incident, Pakozdi withdrew from the tournament, and the video of the harassment went viral online, eliciting national critique of sexist culture in the video-gaming community.\n Such a story is not uncommon in the video-gaming community, where the sexualization of female video game characters contributes to a larger culture of misogyny, said Mayze Teitler ’14, a 2013-2014 Brace Student Fellow. Teitler presented her research about women and the gaming industry in her presentation “Princesses, Soldiers and Prostitutes: Gender Stereotypes in Video Gaming” this past Monday.\n Teitler was first intrigued by the subject because of her roommate’s obsession with the video game “League of Legends” (2009) last winter.\n “All the women were wearing bikinis or basically nothing, and all the male characters were muscular guys with axes, and I was like ‘Whoa! What is going on?’ This attuned me to the issue that I wasn’t really aware of before, which was how disparate the two presentations of male and female characters were in video games,” said Teitler in an interview with The Phillipian.\n Delving into her research over the summer, Teitler analyzed depictions of female characters in video games. She divided female characters into two distinct categories, which she labeled the “damsel in distress” and the “seductress.” \n Teitler defined the “damsel in distress” as a female character who is unable to free herself and requires a male hero to rescue her. This persona is the crux of popular games like “Donkey Kong,” which was first released in 1981.\n “The [Damsel in Distress character] created the idea in the gaming culture that women are primarily passive objects to be acted upon while men are subjects to carry out the actions,” said Teitler in her presentation.\n The character of the “seductress” is an evil, powerful, female character who threatens the male lead.\n “The prevalence of this character trope counterbalanced by the damsel trope creates a scenario where the good women are a prize for the male character, while the bad women are competition and usually dealt with violently,” said Teitler.\n Teitler also referred to a movement in the late 90’s to create more female-friendly games, which would later be categorized as either “pink” or “purple” games. “Pink” refers to games that express traditional ideas of femininity, while “purple” games focus on interpersonal relationships and womens’ issues. \n “Although these games were popular with female players, they led again to the reaffirmation of patriarchal gender roles. And it was found that repeated exposure to these roles strengthened preexisting gender differences and typecasts,” said Teitler.\n Teitler praised video games which did not involve gender stereotyping, specifically Crystal Dynamic’s “Tomb Raider” (2013), which successfully employs a female protagonist who avoids the typical “damsel in distress” situation and is self-sufficient in fending for herself in adverse situations.\n “If people speak out and combat injustice to create an environment more inclusive of all players who will open up the world of gaming and coding to kids who are interested, both male and female, it’ll make gaming more fun to all players,” said Teitler.\n\n', 'Oct 31, 2013'), ('\nIn 100 days, a total of one million Rwandans lay dead after Hutus rampaged through the streets and attacked the Tutsis, resulting in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager, risked his own life to shelter over 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees from violence in the Hotel des Mille Collines.\n Last Friday, Rusesabagina, who inspired the 2004 film “Hotel Rwanda,” led the Andover community through his experiences during the genocide. \n “Many people came to me saying, ‘[The Hutu army] will kill you,’ and I said, ‘Okay, but before they kill me, let me do another small thing.’ And [I] kept going, doing small things, and today, I’m still living. All of these years I’ve been living since 1994 are years of bonus,” he said. \n The army attacked Hotel des Mille Collines many times during the genocide, demanding that Rusesabagina turn over the Tutsi refugees staying at the hotel. \n “I opened the door [of my house] and went to [the soldiers]. How do you open up a discussion with such people? You know that these are soldiers, you know that they are killing your neighbors and killing people all over the country,” said Rusesabagina. \n After two hours of negotiation, the Hutu soldiers finally agreed to leave the refugees alone for a bribe. None of the 1,200 refugees sheltered at the hotel were killed or beaten, said Rusesabagina. \n “That day, I had learned one of the most important lessons that I have ever learned throughout my whole life. I learned how to deal with evil,” he said. \n Although refugees at the hotel urged Rusesabagina to evacuate the hotel with his family, Rusesabagina decided to stay.\n “I made a decision to listen to my own conscience. All the [refugees] were telling me that they were going to jump off [the roof of the hotel] once the army took over the hotel. So I said, ‘Listen my friends, I am not leaving tomorrow,’” he said. \n Rusesabagina said that the international community failed to respond appropriately to the killings in Rwanda. \n “You go through a genocide, a situation whereby, according to the Rwandan government, over a million people were killed. This was more than 15 percent of the Rwandan population. Try to be in my position. During the genocide, I was calling the whole world, urging them to get involved. And everybody was avoiding me from the beginning to the end. What will be your attitude towards the international community?” he said. \n “The [United Nation soldiers] were not making peace, they were not keeping peace; they were just observing and reporting,” he continued. \n Rusesabagina said he was very satisfied with the movie “Hotel Rwanda,” which he directly helped to produce. He travelled with the screenwriter to Johannesburg, South Africa, to gather testimonies from survivors of the genocide and personally worked with Don Cheadle, the actor who portrays him in the movie. \n However, Rusesabagina never left Rwanda, as the film suggests. He was eventually evacuated to a town about 25 kilometers away from Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. After just two weeks, he returned to the Hotel des Mille Collines and started to clean the hotel.\n After the Rwandan genocide, Rusesabagina continued to support victims of genocide. In 2005, Rusesabagina established the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation (HRRF) and devoted his career to promoting peace in Rwanda and the surrounding region, according to the HRRF website. \n The situation in Rwanda and other African countries has not improved much from 20 years ago. Corrupt militia still control the region, said Rusesabagina. \n “[It] is our mission to actually be the voice of those people in Africa who cannot talk for themselves, who do not have any platform, who don’t have any chance to tell their stories… to talk about how tortured they have been, how many women in terms of millions and men have been killed… So I have a lot to do, and I’m always busy travelling the world advocating,” he said in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Rusesabagina’s visit, hosted by the African Student Union (ASU), was made possible by an Abbot Grant. \n “Genocide in Africa is often times generalized and seen as a distant atrocity. Rusesabagina really personalizes it. He had a message for the community, a message that I think a lot of American students were unaware of,” said Laura Bucklin ’14, Co-President of ASU.\n\n', 'Oct 31, 2013'), ('\nIn order to highlight female athletic games and achievements, the Athletics Department has changed the competition scheduling for the rest of the year, according to Mike Kuta, Director of Athletics.\nThe largest change to the schedule was made in the Winter Andover/Exeter games schedule, which will be held at Andover this year. Games played by the same gender will now run simultaneously, contrary to previous years when female and male athletic contests conflicted with one another.\nKuta said that while it is difficult for the Athletic Office to control the game schedule when this fall’s Andover/Exeter weekend is hosted by Exeter, Andover could encourage other schools to be more conscious of the role gender plays in the popularity of different sports.\n“When Boys Hockey played opposite Girls Basketball at Andover/Exeter last winter [at Exeter], everyone was at the Boys Hockey and very few people were at the basketball game,” said Karen Kennedy, Athletics Scheduling Officer.\nKuta said, “We’re going to do our very best so that doesn’t happen. The fanbase will now have to make a decision what girls game they want to see and then the next slot, what boys game they want to see.”\nAlthough the Athletic Department has always been interested in the issue of treating boys and girls teams equally, the recent campus focus on gender equality prompted them to look further into sports scheduling, said Kuta.\nKennedy and Kuta are currently working on integrating similar gender-conscious scheduling in interscholastic sports throughout the course of the year.  \n “From the administrative planning point of viewshift. It shouldn’t just be a token gesture to highlight the girls games through scheduling. We now need, as a community, to go out and support all our teams and athletes,” said Lani Silversides, Head Coach of Girls Varsity Basketball.\nAlex Becker ’15, Co-Captain of Girls Varsity Volleyball, said, “Since it is the 40th anniversary of co-education and girl’s sports haven’t been given as much attention, its really great that the school is trying to get [everyone to] appreciate all the sports and skills… We are just as much of an athlete as any other guy.”  \n Though these changes come with good intentions, Tyler Marshall ’14, Co-Head of the Athletic Advisory Board, said that these changes may not address the possibility that students are viewing certain sports because they are more entertaining than others.\n“It might just happen to be that everyone loves football and no one likes field hockey. Sorry, field hockey, but we really can’t change everyone’s mind about that. If everyone likes football, then everyone likes football,” Marshall said.\nBoys Varsity Basketball Head Coach Terrell Ivory said, “A boys basketball game is not any more important than a girls basketball game and vice versa. The importance of the game to the school should be the same and be equal. But we can’t affect why people come to those games.”\nIvory said that ideally no games would overlap. “It’s great when kids don’t have to choose between watching one sport or another. I would like to see us get as many people in the stands as possible.”\nJosh Murphy ’15 said, “At Andover/Exeter, the Boys Basketball game and the Boys Hockey game are both very popular games to watch. It’s a bummer that we will have to choose between the two.”\n“I think people will be in favor of this and will want to see it work and see it do well,” said Kate Dolan, Head Coach of Field Hockey. “As a school, this will send the message that in sports, we are treating both genders the same.”\nDiana Tchadi ’14, Co-Captain of Girls Varsity Soccer, said, “I think it is important that all teams are highlighted and represented equally. As an athlete you have to work really hard day after day to perform well in games… so you naturally want fans to come see you perform. But when the fans cluster around one sport, or one particular gender, and thus neglect the others, the athletes [who] are not showcased won’t perform as well.”\nKent McLaughlin ’15 said, “The idea behind the change actually makes sense. I think that it’s true that girls don’t have as many fans come to their games because people will rather go to the Boys Hockey game, for example, that’s happening at the same time.\n\n', 'Oct 25, 2013'), ('\nLast Friday, Jackson Herz ’17 went to crew practice, excited to reunite with his parents later that night for the first time since he arrived on Andover’s campus in September.

UserVoice features the ability for users to electronically vote on certain ideas. “You [the user] are allocated a certain number of votes. What the tool does is it surfaces the cream of the crop ideas. The ideas that really resonate with the community will filter to the top,” said Michael Barker, Director of Institutional Research and Assessment. In this way, UserVoice differs from conventional online forums where ideas remain static once they are posted, said Barker. Though Barker plans to use UserVoice primarily for strategic planning purposes, he thinks that the employment of UserVoice in normal faculty meetings will help streamline the decision-making process. UserVoice is intended to address concerns that surfaced at a faculty meeting earlier in the year about the difficulty of gaining organized feedback. “The one thing about UserVoice is that you can’t sign on anonymously. You can’t just post any comment anonymously. One of the principal philosophies underlying the site is that you are accountable for your opinions, which I think is a great thing,” said Barker. “It is not always necessary to have meetings in person,” Barker continued. “Rather than going to Kemper Auditorium or a classroom, it is possible to voice your opinion in a transparent way from a phone, iPad or computer.”\n\n', 'Oct 24, 2013'), ('\nStudents may be able to apply to multiple Andover-run student summer programs at once through a common application starting this summer.

It’s possible, though less likely, to have a common application for all of them, and it’s also possible that we stay with different applications for each program,” said Thomas Hodgson, Instructor in Religion and Philosophy and the Program Director of BASK in ASK.

By the end of October, the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL) will add 117,000 full e-textbooks to its catalogue as part of a free pilot program funded by the Massachusetts Library System (MLS). Fifty libraries in Massachusetts are part of the trial period of the e-book access program, which gives libraries subscriptions to e-book providers. MLS hopes to expand the program to libraries in the entire state. This state-funded effort is only a part of the OWHL’s attempts to digitize its collection. Over the past few years, the OWHL has slowed down its acquisition of print materials, instead focusing on increasing its e-text collection. With the new program, the e-texts in the OWHL will vastly outnumber the printed copies. By the end of October, there will be a total of 287,000 e-texts and only 120,000 print books. Buying the print format of books requires the library to buy book by book. However, while buying e-texts, the library usually purchases licenses for entire collections, allowing the library’s budget to stretch further. “Our library is very lucky. We are well supported, and we are in some ways a leader. It is appropriate for us to participate in things that might help all the libraries in this state,” said Elisabeth Tully, Director of the OWHL. Students can currently borrow laptops, Kindles, iPod Nanos, Nooks and iPads. In addition, the library subscribes to a service called Overdrive, which allows students to download e-books and audio to their own devices. The library’s digital transformation began in 1991, when the OWHL transitioned from a physical card catalog to a digital catalog. In 2001, the library stopped subscribing to academic journals in print, and started buying access to large databases of journals, such as JSTOR and project MUSE. “We began to acquire full text electronic reference products very early into the 2000s. As they became available, we bought them and kept the print copies so that we had them available when we needed them,” Tully said. In 2006, with the onset of WiFi, the library started loaning out laptops for student access, as it was one of the first buildings on campus to have WiFi access. The OWHL bought its first subscription to e-books in 2010, through the company e-brary, making it one of the first high schools with an e-book subscription. The library continued its e-book integration in 2011 by creating QR-codes for reference books to connect the physical copies with their e-book counterparts. “It’s really cool because if there’s a four volume set and you can’t find volume three and you really need it, you can take a picture of that code which will take you right to the book,” said Kathrine Aydelott, Instructional Librarian. As e-texts and internet resources grow, the role of OWHL librarians has evolved to include helping students navigate the abundance of electronic resources, said Tully. “At the help desk, we’re now trying to direct students to more effective ways to research. So, if we find something more appropriate, in a better way and more comprehensive, we’ll direct them to that because it’s much easier for them than having to go through the 80 databases of information,” said Sharon Pei, Instructional Librarian. The OWHL hopes the new e-texts will help students access information for research projects more efficiently, as they allow the reader to easily search the entire book for a certain phrase or concept without having to read the entirety of it. Tully envisions even more changes for the library in the coming years, including a potential “iPad vending machine” that allows students to borrow iPads by swiping his or her BlueCard.\n\n', 'Oct 24, 2013'), ('\n“Within our lifetimes, this nation will undergo a transformation never before made on the face of the globe in human history. We will cease to have a single identifiable racial majority,” said Frank Wu as he concluded his All-School Meeting presentation on race relations and civil rights, primarily concerning Asian-Americans, in the United States. \n Wu is a Chancellor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and the author of “Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White.”\n In his presentation, Wu addressed the racial prejudice still present in modern American society. Growing up, Wu’s family was the only Asian family in a predominately white neighborhood. “Back then, I’m ashamed to say, I was embarrassed of my parents… because we stood out and were different, in a time before diversity was ever celebrated,” said Wu in his presentation. \n Although Wu said that a racial majority in the U.S. will soon disappear, racial prejudice will remain. “I take very seriously this question they ask, which is: ‘why are we still at it?,’” said Wu. “I don’t think it will ever be finished. As an optimist, as a believer of the American Dream, I would insist that none of this is ever over,” he continued in his presentation. \n In an interview with The Phillipian, Wu said that, as a minority, there comes a moment when a decision must be made about whether or not it is necessary to intervene when someone makes racial comments. Whether consciously or not, all people participate in stereotyping.\n “Just think about democracy for a moment, what makes the United States that city upon a hill… what we seek to offer to others. Democracy is a process, not an outcome. Democracy depends on our active participation. Maybe diversity is the same,” continued Wu.\n Wu specifically remembers when this process became part of his life, marked by the death of Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American. Chin’s murder, in 1982, was a turning point between Wu’s childhood bitterness about being Asian-American and his current passion for racial equity.\n Chin was brutally beaten by two white men with a baseball bat in Detroit on the grounds of racial discrimination. Chin’s skull was cracked open onto the pavement and he fell into a coma, dying two days later. Chin’s assailants were put on probation for three months and fined $3000 each, according to Wu. \n “That moment caused a movement to begin,” said Wu during his presentation. “The death of this man led to the birth of Asian-Americans, in some sense.”\n Aya Murata, Faculty Advisor of Asian Society, selected Wu as the inaugural Youth From Every Quarter (YFEQ) speaker. YFEQ speakers will present annually, similarly to the Kaleidoscope, Martin Luther King, Wellness Week and Finis Origine Pendet speakers, according to Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students. \n “[Wu] is an eloquent thinker, writer and advocate of exploring and understanding issues related to race and racial identity within and beyond the typical black-white dynamic,” said Hoyt, in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “It’s a process,” said Murata about Wu’s comments on racial discrimination. “We have that same conversation and dialogue here on campus. We have a [Community and Multicultural Development] office, and we’re ‘super diverse,’ but we forget that we’re an evolving community, so you never get to that perfect place. There’s always going to be a role for students who want to engage in those kinds of conversations.” \n Wu’s visit was funded by the Hosch Family Fund and sponsored by the Asian Society and CAMD.\n\n', 'Oct 24, 2013'), ('\nThe BlueCard swipe-entry system in the Borden Gym locker rooms may soon spread to academic, residential and administrative buildings, said Chris Joel, Director of Business Services. Discussions are currently underway to expand the swipe-entry system as part of the BlueCard Access project, which Joel has spearheaded over the past six months. The specific buildings affected and an official time frame have yet to be determined. “We consider card access to be the next phase of lock-and-key and would generally consider it to be a better solution in our environment because of its advantages. It should also be noted that card access is being used at the majority of colleges and universities,” said Joel. The swipe-entry locks will lower maintenance costs. The downside of the current key-entry system is the high price and difficulty of replacing locking mechanisms and lost keys. With the new project, keys can be replaced at a lower cost without needing to worry about replacing the lock, according to Joel. “If a key is lost, the lock might need to be replaced. With a card, the card can be immediately disabled and a new card issued, levels of access can be easily changed to accommodate a variety of access scenarios, and buildings can be locked and unlocked remotely via a schedule or immediately if needed,” Joel said. As of September 16, all locker rooms and designated exterior doors in Borden have employed BlueCard swipe-entry system access. The main doors are unlocked for most of the day, but a BlueCard is required to open the other exterior doors and locker room doors all day. Student reactions to the current card-entry system in the locker rooms have been largely negative. “I understand it’s for safety and everything, but if you don’t have your Blue Card you have to stand outside and bang on the door and it’s really just a struggle. And if you don’t have anything to carry your Blue Card in, then you are stuck,” said Mahlet Ayana ’17. Lane Unsworth ’15 said, “The BlueCard system doesn’t work for me because I don’t like bringing my BlueCard with me to sports because I’m afraid I’ll lose it. So when I return from my sport, I don’t have my card with me, and I have to wait outside the locker room until someone else lets me in.”\n\n', 'Oct 24, 2013'), ('\nPaul Murphy, Dean of Students, Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students, and Cluster Deans are creating a dress code for dances.

Known by students, faculty and fellow staff alike as “Billy,” Flynn is a proud patch collector, having accumulated over 500 police patches and four denim jackets covered in them. Out of all the police patches he owns, his favorite is that of the Andover Police.\n Billy, 44, is a beloved member of the Paresky Commons food service team. He has worked at Paresky for 24 years. Right after his high school graduation, he earned a two-week trial in Paresky, and has been working there ever since. His first job was to clean the dishes and do odd jobs, but now he has worked his way to the position of Custodial Supervisor. This year will be his 25th year at Andover.\n “I’ve always wanted to work at Phillips Academy,” Billy said.\n A few things may strike you once you get to know Billy, especially his kindness and good nature. If you meet him in Paresky, he will greet you and ask you about your day. Amogh Sharma ’14 said that Billy greets him every time he is in Commons, even though the two don’t know each other very well. \n Billy is very attentive of safety and is CPR-certified, often warning students of potentially dangerous situations.One day at lunch, Billy came up to Chris Lai ’14 and told him to be careful when walking because he had just finished mopping the floor.\n Billy is incredibly passionate for several charitable causes. Every year, Billy raises funds for diabetes. As a diabetic himself, he knows the troubles of having the disease and hopes that by raising funds for this cause, scientists will someday find a cure. He has been donating at least $1,000 each year and broke his own fundraising record this year. \n Billy said that he has raised $3,218.34 so far this year, surpassing his initial goal of $3,000. “Can you put the link to my donating page in the article?” Billy said. The link can be found in the online article, or by Googling “William’s Step Out Page.”\n At the age of ten, Billy joined the ARC weekly community service program for special needs individuals, where Andover students and ARC ‘buddies’ bond over 90 minutes of games and activities. He has been attending ARC every Tuesday for the past 34 years, and is famously known for sharing his tunes with his ARC buddies.\n Every ARC session, Billy rocks his yellow neon jacket, New Balance sneakers—which he says are essential for road safety—and his Andover hat. He sets up his speakers, plugs-in his iPhone and plays his favorite tunes such as “Beat It” by Michael Jackson, “Y.M.C.A” by Village People, “Lady in Red” by Chris de Burgh or songs from the “Rocky” soundtrack.

Peabody Museum and National Geographic- Sponsored archaeologist, gave a presentation about the Central Yucatán Archaeological Cave Project (CYAC) trip he led to the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in 2011. \n “[Archaeology] has been a passion all my life. I really can’t remember a time when I was not interested in things that are old,” said Slater.\n Slater’s presentation focused on his dissertation about Mayan caves and their use as ritual spaces. While leading the CYAC, Slater ventured into caves to which outsiders had never before had access. \n “[My favorite part about archeological research] is probably the thrill that I get from visiting a new place, especially if it’s a site that I’ve had the privilege of being the first outsider to investigate. So, being the first person to explore some of the caves that I’ve documented has been a real treat.”\n While in Mexico, Slater analyzed the various beliefs of Mesoamerican civilizations surrounding caves. These were at varying times believed to be the wellsprings of k’ul, the souls of the world, or even the locus of human genesis. The existence of this folklore indicated that the caves had been used for rituals since the rise of Mayan civilization. \n By highlighting the various Mesoamerican interpretations of these caves, Slater said he hopes to help people see them as more than a collection of ruined settlements and bring the Mayan caves to the forefront of archaeological inquiry. \n “I think a lot of times [Mayan caves] get overlooked,” said Slater. “There’s been enough scholarship conducted to demonstrate caves’ importance that they should be given consideration during any regional project in the Maya area.”\n Slater will be earning his doctorate in \xad\xadanthropology with a focus in archaeology. \n Aside from focusing on the Mayan caves for his doctorate and teaching at the Peabody Museum, Slater is a National Geographic-sponsored archaeologist.

Although the club has changed in size and structure, its underlying mission has remained the same: to support LGBTQ students at Andover. With just under 87 percent of the student body identifying as straight in last year’s State of the Academy survey, the LGBTQ population at Andover has certainly expanded. Despite being arguably more empowered than ever before, this demographic still faces undeniable challenges on campus and in the larger world. GSA@25, which marked the group’s 25th year this past weekend, served as both a recognition of this group’s struggles and a celebration of their accomplishments.\n![](http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/ekaufmannladuc.alumniprez003_0.jpg)\xa0\nAugustin McCarthy ’88 returned to campus for GSA @25\n_E.Kaufman-Laduc/The Phillipian_\n**Addison Exhibit Showcases LGBTQ Artwork**\nAlumni and community members gathered at the Addison Gallery of American Art to see, hear and discuss artwork by a number of LGBTQ artists, such as George Tooker, David Armstrong, Nan Goldin, Mark Morrisroe and David Wojnarowicz. Armstrong, Goldin and Morrisroe, met at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA), Boston, where they studied together.\nAt the beginning of the event, the attendees were asked to stand up and observe the various pieces of art, largely comprised of real-life photographs. Some took notes while others simply appreciated the sincerity and authenticity of the photographs.\nEach piece of art represented various relevant issues and themes pertaining to the artists’ daily struggles of being part of the LGBTQ community. Two of Goldin’s photographs, for example, depicted drag queens that were not made up, but rather natural.\nAfter the actual discussion, the group sat down to listen to the poetic works of Nancy Boutilier, former Instructor in English at Andover. She recited three poems from her published works, including “On The Eighth Day Slept Hall” and “According to Her Contours.” Gender identity and sexual confusion were underlying themes in all three poems.\nThe audience also ventured upstairs to see “The Kids Are Alright,” a current exhibition at the Addison that examines all forms of family in the 21st century. Thirty-eight artists’ works are on display, and Rebecca Hayes, Curator of Education at the Addison, had selected three artists to focus on from the LGBTQ community. Julie Mack, Catherine Opie and Betsy Schneider attempted to realistically portray the struggles of their lifestyles as gay women in the artistic community.\n“The discussion was very deep, very interesting and touching, and when people were making connections that I hadn’t even considered, I realized that there was so much behind every single person and their story that I don’t even know,” said Paulina Munn ’15.\n![](http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/jschmitt.GSAparade014_0.jpg)\xa0\nStudents and faculty members march together to show their pride.\n_E.Kaufman-Laduc/The Phillipian_\n**First Pride Parade Celebrates GSA’s 25th Year**\nCarrying rainbow banners and wearing brightly colored clothing and necklaces, over sixty students, faculty and alumni paraded around campus to honor the 25th anniversary of the founding of GSA at Andover, to the rhythms of Drumline, Andover’s student-run percussion group,\n“It’s the 25th anniversary of our GSA conference and of our GSA, so we wanted to make it a monumental event. We’ve never had a gay pride parade before in the history of Andover, so we thought that [the parade] would be an adequate way to really solidify the legacy of this GSA and make it memorable,” said Malina Simard-Halm ’14, Co-President of GSA.\nAs the parade passed through the Great Lawn and onto the steps of Samuel Phillips Hall, numerous spectators came to watch.\n“Gay pride parades have been around since the early 80s in this country, and now they’re kind of a universal phenomenon. I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to have a parade [on campus] that is fun, very colorful, with beads and celebration and cheering?’” said Peg Harrigan, Instructor in Art and Faculty Advisor to GSA.\n“I’d hope that we might start doing [gay pride parades] as part of our [GSA] weekend every fall and acknowledge not just GSA, gay pride or how we fit into the bigger world in terms of the diversity of sexual orientation, but celebrate it in a demonstrative, colorful way,” Harrigan said.\nIn addition to raising awareness about and celebrating GSA, the gay pride parade also demonstrated how much GSA has grown since it was founded.\nHanover Vale ’15, a GSA board member, said, “We’ve extended so far that we can have over 60 people show up for a parade, so it’s amazing to see the development [of GSA] over the span of 25 years.

He then committed himself to creating an environment where people of all sexuality were respected, laying the foundation for the official establishment of the Gay Straight Alliance in 1989, now known as the Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA).\nMcCarthy, Barbara Dalton Rotundo ’00, Annie Wilkin ’05, Kevin Hatcher ’05, Hector Kilgoe ’11 and Nancy Boutilier, former Instructor in English, returned to campus to share their journeys in discovering and becoming comfortable with their own sexual orientations.\n“Being gay meant being visibly different when I was on campus,” said McCarthy, reflecting back to his time at Andover when GSA had about five student members. Since that point, however, Andover’s LGBTQ community has grown considerably, becoming more accepting of various sexual orientations.\nIn 1999, Rotundo gave a speech about the meaning of bisexuality during an All School Meeting, coming out as bisexual to the entire school.\n“It is a real statement about [Andover] and where it was in the late 90s that the scariest thing about doing that was the public speaking part. I was not at all afraid coming out that I was bisexual. I could have been saying anything, and it would have been just as terrifying,” said Rotundo.\nRotundo said that the presence of the GSA helped foster the accepting environment of people of all sexual identities.\n“The fact that GSA was there on campus, even before I came out during my Senior year, helped me feel much more comfortable about my sexuality. This environment, though not perfect, is a place where people are constantly trying to have a dialogue about difficult things, including sexuality,” Rotundo continued.\nKilgoe found refuge in not only GSA, but also the larger LGBTQ community at Andover as he struggled to become comfortable with his sexual orientation. Now a student the University of Pennsylvania, he is a member of the Queer People of Color group.\n“Even at Andover, I dealt with lots of homophobia that wasn’t directed at me. People would talk a lot about other gay students in front of me, and I was expected to just join into those things because they didn’t think that I was gay. But I had this huge support group, GSA, that I could always go to,” Kilgoe said.\nBoutilier agreed, saying that she and her group of friends were able to power through both conscious and subconscious discrimination from students with their sense of community as queers.\nWhile some speakers talked about their personal Andover experiences, others focused more on how their sexual identities affected their career choices.\nHatcher previously worked with queer youth of color in Atlanta, drawing from his own struggles as a gay black man. He is currently working with over 80 low-income schools through Teach for America, helping them provide better education for underprivileged youth.\n“I’m really proud to say that I am leading [the organization’s] thinking on how to expand the definition of diversity beyond race and socioeconomic background. The organization… is really starting to push the boundaries to think about how to support queer kids overcome bullying and homophobia,” Hatcher said.\nAs a teacher, Wilkin also incorporates her own experiences as a bisexual person into her lessons, striving to create a classroom environment where sexuality can be discussed openly yet respectfully and sensitively.\nShe hopes to expand beyond her own practices and educate other teachers on how to also create a similar classroom environment that is comfortable for people of all sexual orientations.\nFilm Showings Explore Past On Saturday, two visiting artists presented their films that explored their relationships with the people closest to them and how they influenced their personal sense of expression. Each artist used a different medium to portray past experiences, but all conveyed the same message: beauty and strength are often intertwined.\nMickalene Thomas, a native of Brooklyn, New York, presented her short documentary, “Happy Birthday to a Beautiful Woman.” Produced by Thomas and Tanya Selvaratnam ’88, the documentary focused on Thomas’s mother, Sandra Bush.\nStriking deep reds, purples and emeralds set the background to Bush’s powerful retelling of her life experiences to Thomas. At 6’1”, Bush was a statuesque runway model. Despite her physical beauty, she faced the emotional turmoil of domestic abuse and drug addiction. Bush persevered, eventually overcoming her drug addiction and staying healthy up until the filming of the documentary.\n“What inspired me to make this specific piece was that my mother was dying,” Thomas said. “I said to her, ‘If I could find a way to use you in my work again, with a different medium’—I didn’t want to photograph her while she was sick.”\n“I thought the film was very good and that the creator’s relationship to the subject helped it make even more special. The soundtrack was amazing because it added to the dimension of the film,” said Kasey Welch ’16 in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\nFollowing Thomas’s presentation was a multimedia reading and dance performance entitled “Life on the Moon: Taking Action in Times of Fear,” written by Agustin McCarthy ’88. McCarthy, who co-founded GSA during his time at Andover, wrote a script that reflected the experiences he had as a teenager. The script was read aloud by guest actors and members of GSA, aided by projections and instrumental music.\nMcCarthy’s creation featured a fictional protagonist, Riley Davis, who is an openly gay teenager attempting to start a GSA Club at Andover. His sister, Gwen, does not approve, and asks him to just be “normal.” Despite backlash, he continues to develop his identity as a gay individual and even expresses himself through the art of ballet.\nNancy Boutilier, a former Instructor in English, was the faculty advisor when McCarthy began GSA and saw clear lines between the fictional film and the genesis of GSA here.\n“When we started the GSA, we were thinking about creating a place where people could survive at Andover. It’s really exciting that GSA allows people to thrive at Andover,” she said.\n\n**Simard-Halm Finds Personal Threads in LGBTQ Research**\nGrowing up, Malina Simard-Halm ’14 occasionally felt extremely self-conscious of her gay parents. At one point, she even kept their sexuality a secret from her friends.\n“When I was younger, I thought it was okay to push my parents in the closet whenever it was convenient for me. That really silenced me,” she said.\nSimard-Halm investigated the effects of LGBTQ parents on families like hers, using interviews she conducted with 30 children of LGBTQ parents and secondary research papers for her presentation last Saturday.\n“It was so incredible to do this research because a lot of the time I felt alone when I was younger,” Simard-Halm said in her presentation.\nSimard-Halm was one of the first five children in the United States born to gay parents through a surrogate mother, and her parents were the first gay parents in the country to win the right to have both of their names on their child’s birth certificate, according to “The Guardian.”\nFearing judgment, many of the children with LGBTQ parents she interviewed chose not to tell other people about their parents, Simard-Halm said.\nOne of Simard-Halm’s interviewees, Lizzie Hurley, saw her parents excommunicated from their church as a result of their sexuality.\n“Generally, no one really talks about it, but I can certainly feel the tensions from some of the parents. One time, my family wanted to host an exchange student from Mexico, and the school wouldn’t allow it,” said Hurley in an interview with Simard-Halm.\nThough LGBTQ families live in 93 percent of American counties, many state governments do not recognize families with two parents of the same sex.\nLGBTQ families are twice as likely to live in poverty, as they often fail to meet government requirements on the definition of a family and therefore are unable to receive benefits such as tax cuts and government-funded programs like welfare or disability benefits, according to Simard-Halm.\n“Yes, there are still struggles, but there are powerful people fighting,” said Simard-Halm during her presentation.\nSimard-Halm discovered contradicting results in studies of children of LGBTQ parents, as studies funded by socially conservative institutions said that children of LGBTQ parents were more likely to be gay and suicidal.\nHowever, those studies were not peer-reviewed, and more robust research indicates that there is little to no difference between children of LGBTQ and straight parents, though children of LGBTQ parents tend to be more open about their sexuality, she said.\n“I recognize how powerful and pioneering my parents were and they were breaking boundaries and setting a path and stage for other parents to follow,” said Simard-Halm during her presentation.\n\xa0\nParade participants fold their colored flags.\n_E.Kaufman-Laduc/The Phillipian_\n**Students Act as LGBTQ Leaders on Campus**\nGSA hosted a student panel to explore the ramifications of LGBTQ identity at Andover in Kemper Auditorium last Saturday.\nPanelists Jaleel Williams ’15, Harry Wright ’14, Sean Burkitt ’14, Alyssa Augustin ’15, Hanover Vale ’15, all board members of GSA, and Kai Kornegay ’14, Co-President of GSA, answered student and alumni-submitted questions alongside their own experiences as LGBTQ students. Malina Simard-Halm ’14, Co-President of GSA, moderated the panel discussion.\n“It was just an update on what’s changed [in the past 25 years], how the GSA is doing on campus, what life is currently like for LGBTQ students as of now,” said Williams in an interview with The Phillipian.\nAugustin, along with several other panelists, described students’ roles in the greater community as LGBTQ leaders as an expression of “non sibi” in their daily lives.\n“I try to be as expressive as possible, so that other people can recognize and look up to you, and also, I do like answering questions. Besides GSA, there isn’t much public education about LGBTQ people, so [I try to help] when my friends do have questions. Someone called me an LGBTQ encyclopedia. I like to try to be that person,” said Augustin during the panel.\nLike Augustin, Wright mentioned how he tries to lead dorm discussions on LGBTQ issues and serve as a mentor to the students in his dorm.\n“Last year, one of the students in my dorm came out to me and not to anybody else. I was really happy for him to do that and that he was comfortable enough with me and that I could be a resource for them… It’s great to be out and to be a leader on campus, just to be visible to everybody,” said Wright.\nIn addition to their roles in the community, the panelists noted the differences between coming out at Andover and at home.\n“I’m actually very thankful for Andover for allowing me sort of like a cushion in which I can express myself and build up self-confidence,” said Williams during the panel. “When I go home, I will wear shorts that are not nearly as short as the ones I wear here, and I’ll still get weird looks or comments from my home friends.”\n“I’ve built up a strong enough reserve from being on campus that I feel like I can go out into the real world. I feel like I won’t need as much external support or self-confidence later on, since I already have it,” Williams continued.\nThough Andover fosters an open and understanding environment for LGBTQ students, Kornegay argued that the school administration still needed to more comfortable in acknowledging that students are sexually active.\n“Once [the school] acknowledges [students’ sexual activity], then there might be reform on the parietal system or the hook up culture, because right now, it’s sort of taboo… So because we’re not even talking about this in a heteronormative sense, then we’re not going to talk about it in a LGBTQ sense,” said Kornegay.\n\xa0\n\n', 'Oct 17, 2013'), ('\nNext fall, the Andover community will have a new space to develop, test and assess new ways of experimental and experiential learning. Currently in its “quiet year,” the Andover Institute will serve as a nexus for faculty, staff, students and visitors to cultivate pedagogic innovation in three key areas—outreach, global citizenship and connected learning.\n A more specific purpose and concrete framework of the Andover Institute will depend on the priorities of Andover to be determined by the Strategic Plan, which, when completed next fall, will determine the allocation of Andover’s resources for the next five to ten years. Meanwhile, the Institute has taken a step closer to becoming an official center on campus with the appointment of Caroline Nolan as its first Director last Monday. \n The unofficial launch of the Andover Institute this year culminates the innovation and experimentation in teaching and learning that has been occurring on campus, said Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School.\n “I think of the Institute as an invitation to people to come together to collaborate and exchange ideas. Many teachers are already trying new teaching techniques inside and outside their classrooms, so it will be offering support in a form of a place where people can come together and talk about what they are trying,” she said. \n Existing projects initiated by Andover faculty, such as the Math Department’s collaboration with Khan Academy and the online BC Calculus course created by Christopher Odden, Instructor in Mathematics, will fall under the rubric of the Andover Institute, and Nolan will help facilitate the development and expansion of these initiatives. \n “It seems to me that there’s a lot of energy around innovation generally and the possible establishment [of the Andover Institute], particularly among the faculty, who are proposing projects and helping to plan and build them,” said Nolan.\n After its official launch, the Andover Institute will have rotating Faculty Fellow positions to allow current faculty members to work on specific innovative teaching and learning projects that can then be translated back into classroom use, according to the Andover Institute for Innovation Concept Note.\n One of the Andover Institute’s initial focuses is to instill the idea of global citizenship on campus by providing more off-campus learning opportunities, in addition to further supporting and coordinating pre-existing programs. \n The Niswarth program, a service-learning program in India, looks forward to collaborating with the Andover Institute to define the essential elements of a global program, integrate summer experiences into the school year curricula and fundraise in order to expand and solidify its program, according to Raj Mundra, Instructor in Biology and Director of the Niswarth Program. \n Nolan will spend the next year working with programs such as Niswarth to solidify the purpose and mission of Andover Institute. \n Prior to her new role as the Director of the Andover Institute, Nolan worked at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University with Head of School John Palfrey, who was the Executive Director of the Berkman Center. \n “I think that my previous work at the Berkman Center, which is not only a research center but also an entrepreneurial and mission-driven place that very much seeks to be a platform for building and scaling ideas for greater impact, will be helpful in my role [as the Director of Andover Institute],” said Nolan.\n Nolan graduated from Brown University and attended Fletcher School of International Affairs at Tufts University, where she became particularly interested in global citizenship. At the Berkman Center at Harvard University, she led projects focused on incorporating technology in various fields, including education.\n\n', 'Oct 17, 2013'), ('\nOn Tuesday, November 5, the Senior Administrative Council (SAC) will conduct a student survey during Conference Period in order to solicit student input for Andover’s Strategic Plan.\n The new Strategic Plan, to be completed this year, will outline Andover’s priorities for the coming years. The Strategic Plan will culminate in a presentation presented to the Board of Trustees in the fall of 2014. To do so, the SAC has made incorporating input from students, trustees, faculty and alumni a priority. Last month, the faculty completed “Dreams for Andover,” a brainstorm where faculty wrote down what they thought the Strategic Plan should address. The SAC will have students state their ideas for the direction they wish to see Andover moving in over the next three to five years. The survey will be conducted via Stormboard, an online whiteboard with virtual sticky notes, according to Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning. \n “What things do they love about Andover? What suggestions do they have for what Andover could be doing better?” said Skiffer. “We did want to provide a forum for students to brainstorm ideas in much the same way that faculty did and administrators and staff will do,” she added. The SAC plans to conduct activities with Andover alumni and trustees with the similar goal to generate input for the Strategic Plan, according to Skiffer.\n The members of the SAC include Steve Carter, Chief Financial Officer, Pat Farrell, Dean of Faculty, Linda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling, Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life, Head of School John Palfrey, Peter Ramsey, Secretary of the Academy, Trish Russell, Dean of Studies, Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning, Tracy Sweet, Director of Academy Communications, and Jim Ventre, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid.\n\n', 'Oct 17, 2013'), ('\nIn the summer of 2012, Tom Conlon, Director of Public Safety, was directed into the basement of an unfamiliar building at Milton Academy where he was attacked by two shooters. Though the attacks were staged as part of a drill, Conlon’s alarm was real. \n At a moment’s notice, he and ?ve other safety of?cers had to strategize an emergency response. Conlon and the others ran into a room with no lock on the door. He could hear a commotion at the top of the stairwell. The faux shooters ?red multiple shots. As the shooters approached, one participant lost his composure, curling up into the fetal position and hiding under a shelf. \n The others remained calm, however, barricading the door as quickly as possible. The shooters jostled the door, but could not break through. Though Conlon and the team had passed the test, they had gotten lucky—the barricade worked against all odds. Conlon now understands that there should have been a lock on the door.\n Ever since the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Conlon and the Phillips Academy Public Safety (PAPS) of?ce have been working to improve safety at Andover. Drawing upon knowledge from the training program at Milton Academy, the PAPS team has kept all secondary doors to campus buildings locked since the beginning of this year’s Summer Session. \n Last Friday in an interview with The Phillipian, Conlon relaxed in the Public Safety building next to Graves Hall. In the comfort of his of?ce, he did not wear his trademark cowboy hat, but he maintained his characteristic warmth. \n “We have to put people’s safety as the paramount,” he said. \n “The locking of the exterior doors in a timely manner provides the ?rst line of a defensive barrier against a shooter. In most cases, the shooter moves on until a door is found that provides easy access,” wrote Conlon in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n In addition to locking doors, Conlon sent a school-wide e-mail on October 7 with instructions on reacting to an active shooter. PAPS also held a practice lockdown on October 10. By making campus buildings easily securable and increasing awareness of emergency situations, Conlon and the Public Safety team hope to improve campus safety.\n Lockdowns also prepare students for more than just an attack by a shooter. “A shelter in place could be because of a weather emergency… We had tornado warnings this summer at the start of Summer Session… as kids were arriving,” said Conlon.\n Conlon said that campus members have reacted well to the changes. “The response has been very positive about what we’ve been doing here, to try and help out in case of an eventual emergency around campus.” \n However, several students have not accepted the locked doors so readily. As their usual routes around campus have been altered, they have had their reservations.\n “Why do I have to walk all the way around Sam Phil because I can’t get in through the side or back door?… [Shooters] can still get into all the buildings,” said Alec Tolentino ’ 14.\n These locked doors not only cause irritation—they strike fear in the minds of other students. Sarah Cornelius ’14 said, “What if there’s a shooter that is outside and you’re trying to get into a building for safety and there’s only one way you can get in? That seems scary to me.” \n With negative views so widespread among the student body, some predict changes. “I think [Public Safety] will get so many complaints that they may open more doors back up,” said Drake Danner ’14.\n Although Conlon understands these struggles, admitting that even he has had to change some of his typical routes around campus, he said that he has no plans to unlock the doors. \n “I think you have to plan for the worst and hope it never happens. And although I don’t think it would happen up here at PA, nothing is guaranteed 100 percent anywhere,” said Conlon shortly before opening his of?ce door and departing.\n_This article was written for English 514: Journalism and submitted to_ The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Oct 17, 2013'), ('\nInstead of going to class on Wednesday, Seniors attended the College Counseling Office’s (CCO) first three-hour college application workshop and received advice from Andover College Counselors and Deans of Admission from various colleges. “Essentially, we are hoping to give the Seniors a window into how their applications are read and evaluated.

Although previously well-attended by Andover students, both programs have seen a significant decline in attendance in recent years. Andover ceased partnerships with both programs after financial struggles in 2002, said Peter Merrill, Coordinator of Andover’s Global Perspectives Group.\n Now with both the Mountain School and the Island School agreeing to cover three-fourths of the financial aid costs, Merrill hopes that these programs will regain popularity amongst Andover students.\n “The reason we are sort of coming back and trying again with the Mountain School and the Island School is because they won’t be as expensive for us to run… We are sort of putting our toe back in the water of these programs,” said Merrill. “They’re both programs that are heavily driven by values.”\n “Both the Mountain School and the Island School were pleased with the idea that Andover will provide assistance to students on financial aid who are admitted to their programs,” said Jill Thompson, Assistant Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid. “We are excited that both programs would partner with Andover to offer support as needed.” \n At the Mountain School, 45 students from high schools across the country live together for a semester on a small, rural campus in Vershire, Vermont.

The answer is yes. The U.S. has a moral obligation at stake… The argument that says that just because we haven’t used a moral argument in the past or that just because we also have pragmatic desires at stake doesn’t necessarily contradict the fact that we also can’t have a moral need for going into Syria,” said Newman.\nMoustafa offered potential solutions, including the complete conclusion to the war, the pardoning of all political prisoners with the exception of Al Qaeda affiliates and the shift to democracy in Syria. “This would be a plan that would perhaps potentially create a transition into democracy without there having to be a shock-and-awe approach to getting rid of the government,” Moustafa said.\nBucklin elaborated on her hopes for Syria to democratize peacefully, but conceded that this would likely not happen in the near future given the current political stalemate.\n\n', 'Oct 10, 2013'), ('\nIn the midst of the first governmental shutdown since 1995, the Department of History and Social Science hosted an informational forum and Q&A last Thursday evening. \n Planned in response to student interest, the panel featured Christopher Jones, Instructor in History and Social Science, Christopher Shaw, Chair and Instructor in History and Social Science, and Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director. The three shared their knowledge on the shutdown’s relation to politics, the economy and health insurance, respectively.\n “All of you who have been following the news at all are aware of this knock-down, drag-out fight over Obamacare. This current confrontation has pitted opponents of the law with proponents of the law over and within the realm of funding the government,” said Jones in his opening remarks.\n Every fiscal year, Congress passes a budget that provides funding for federal programs. However, since this year’s need for a new budget coincided with the October 1 effective date for many of the provisions of Obamacare, Congress launched into an extensive but inconclusive debate over the contents of the Affordable Care Act. \n “It is that small group of Republican extremists in the House of Representatives who want to end Obamacare and who have made it clear to the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, that they cannot under any circumstances bring the bill that will fund the government to the floor of the House,” said Jones. \n The Individual Mandate, a critical provision of Obamacare that requires that every American purchases health insurance, has come under fire in budget talks. This specification will oblige young and healthy people, many of whom have historically chosen not to buy health insurance, to purchase insurance or pay a tax. The Individual Mandate is intended to offset some of the costs of healthcare and provide healthcare insurance to all, according to Patel. \n “There are about 26 million people who are currently uninsured for a variety of reasons. Some people cannot afford health insurance, and others don’t want to pay for it because they are healthy and young and don’t feel as though they need it,” said Patel.\n Shaw named three critical economic elements contributing to the current impasse in Washington: the deficit, the debt and the debt limit. The deficit is the excess of spending over revenue for the U.S. government in any given fiscal year. Debt is the total amount of debt issued and outstanding by the U.S. government, and is currently at over $16 trillion, said Shaw. The debt limit is the absolute limit on the total debt of the United States. \n “When the U.S. government, which is the largest employer in the United States, shuts down, people get really nervous all around the world,” said Shaw. \n One million government employees are expected to continue working but will not be paid immediately, and 800,000 government employees are furloughed. \n Jones said that informational forums like Thursday’s, which was titled “How can the U.S. Government ‘Shut Down?’” have occurred in the past and were previously encouraged by Victor Henningsen ’69, former Instructor in History. \n “When we go into this mode we are trying to explain stuff to students in a way that is non-political, honest and as clear as we can make it.

Chaperones in the past have turned away students dressed inappropriately at dances, though the rule was not widely enforced or explicitly stated until Saturday morning, said Murphy in an interview with The Phillipian last Saturday.\n“We’ve sent kids back to their dorms to put more clothes on, occasionally, and it tends to be girls and it tends to be female chaperones… We’ve just said, go back and wear shoes, or put on a shirt, and people tend to do that, and they follow the directions and go back,” Murphy said.\nThe clarified restrictions have drawn much opposition from students, who are overwhelmingly against it, according to The Phillipian’s survey.\nOf the 672 students surveyed—357 females and 311 males—82 percent were opposed to the ban on inadequate clothing and sexually suggestive dancing.\nIn the free response sections, many students expressed concern that the terms “inadequate clothing” were too vague, and would overwhelmingly result in punishing female students only. “At a school that is progressive enough to let the students choose the dress appropriate for class without a dress code, it is setting a double standard that we are not allowed the freedom to dress as we want on the weekends, especially social functions,” wrote one respondent. “[The policy of turning inadequately-clothed students away] is not about shaming people as they come to the dance so they have to leave, it’s so that they make a better decision before they even come in the first place,” said Murphy.\nResponding to the ban on sexually suggestive dancing, students conceded that while grinding often makes chaperones and other students uncomfortable, prohibiting it will do little to resolve underlying pressures for students to “hook up.”\nA respondent wrote, “I understand how students dancing in a sexual way could make teacher chaperones uncomfortable. But I don’t necessarily think banning grinding is the answer. If grinding is banned, people will flat out stop going to dances and instead do worse things, getting into more trouble. This will also hurt clubs that host dances, like the GSA dance or regional dances. If the reason for banning grinding is to stop students from casual hookups I don’t think that is not going to stop hooking up.”\nA different respondent wrote, “I strongly object to the idea that grinding shows a lack of self respect. If I choose to participate in a type of dancing that I enjoy, I am showing nothing but self respect.”\nAnother respondent wrote, “Rather than banning it as a whole, students that attempt to grind on others without consent should receive warnings and then they should be banned from dances.” Saturday’s e-mail also sparked discussion on hook up culture and the administration’s steps to address it. Thirty-five percent of surveyed students believe the “hookup” culture is a problem at Andover. Forty-five percent of female respondents and 23 percent of male respondents find it problematic. The percentage of students who believed that “hookup culture” is problematic increased by grade level. Twenty-three percent of Juniors surveyed believe the hookup culture is problematic, in contrast with the 40 percent of Seniors surveyed who believe the same.\nEighty-two percent of students oppose separate dances for upperclassmen and underclassmen. Students who indicated that the hookup culture is problematic were more supportive of the dresscode restriction, grinding ban and grade-separated dances. Seventy percent oppose the dress code restriction, 73 percent oppose the grinding ban, and 77 percent oppose grade-specific dances.\n“I’m sure everyone, including freshmen, is capable of making their own decisions. The school shouldn’t try to make decisions for us. Besides, if it’s going to happen, trust me, the school won’t be able to stop it. Not only that, but a stricter dress code is only restricting our personal expression, which I thought was a strong value at Andover,” wrote a female survey respondent. Because all school events are chaperoned by faculty members, Murphy said a key factor in the decision was chaperones’ comfort levels regarding inappropriate dancing.\n“Some people will say, ‘I’ll chaperone a movie, I’ll chaperone a trip to the Loop, but I will not chaperone a dance, I don’t want to be put into that position,’” said Murphy.\nIn contrast with the overwhelming student disapproval of the change, 82 percent of the 167 faculty and staff surveyed—101 females and 66 males—supported the ban on grinding. Sixty-seven percent supported the dress code restriction. A majority of 62 percent, however, do not approve of separate dances for upperclassmen and underclassmen.\nEleven percent of faculty are current dance chaperones, and 30 percent were chaperones in the past. 59 percent have never chaperoned a dance while at Andover.\nCurrent faculty dance chaperones supported the grinding ban with a smaller majority of 73 percent, and were evenly split on support for the dresscode restrictions. However, 83 percent of former dance chaperones and faculty who had never chaperoned a dance supported the grinding ban.\nA faculty respondent wrote, “I believe many girls on campus think of underdressing as empowering and feminist, but ignore the image they project. They reinforce the image they are fighting, and are a bad influence on younger girls who think they must do this to be cool.” Seventy percent of faculty who had never chaperoned a dance and 65 percent of former chaperones supported the dress code restrictions.\n“I think it is hypocritical of the faculty to monitor dances in this way when we allow closed door parietals. It seems we are less concerned with what might actually be going on between students than with whether or not we have to deal with it directly,” a faculty survey respondent said.\nSeventy percent of all faculty and 84 percent of current faculty dance chaperones believe that the hookup culture is problematic on campus.\n“What might be unique to Andover, though, is the rather disturbing belief that because students are ‘attending one of the greatest prep schools in the world’, to paraphrase the Co-Presidents, they are somehow older or more mature than they really are… Just because we have a lot of smart people here doesn’t mean that our student body is ready for a lot of the behaviors they are engaging in,” said a faculty survey respondent.\nThe decision was made “given conversations that the Cluster Deans and others have had with students and faculty chaperones,” read the e-mail, which was signed by the Cluster Deans and the Community Health Team.\n“This has been an open question for years, and some of us felt that we should just at least take a stab at saying something, and not just hoping nothing bad happens and that people are comfortable,” said Murphy in an interview. “Some people have said, ‘Does the school have the right to tell us how to dance?’ Well yes, we do, it’s a private institution, we tell you guys to do a lot of things and you do it,” Murphy said.\n**Students Respond**\n**Isabel Jaregui ’17:** \xa0“As long as it’s not making other people really uncomfortable, as long as both parties are willing to take part in the activity, I think it’s fine…I think that’s good, that they should be sent back.

I get that people want to dress nicely and provocatively, but I think that sometimes it’s a little bit past taste.”\n**Jaleel Williams ’15** : “Especially because that’s what a lot of Andover’s hook up and dance culture has formed around, instead of trying to solve the problems that have formed from it, which is the way students treat sexuality instead of sexuality itself…As someone who does dress in that traditionally female “promiscuous” way, I’m curious to see if I would be affected by this, whether the administration would look the other way because, even though my shorts are just as short as hers, or probably shorter, they are not as likely to see me in that sexual light because it’s not associated with my gender role.”\n\xa0\n\xa0\n**Megan Gatton ’17:**”I think it’s respect for the comfortability level of those around you, and yes, people may be judging you based on your appearance, which I think is just something you have to accept in our culture today, but I think it’s the right place and the right time, being in an environment that’s not necessarily appropriate. “\n**Emma Khan’14: “** I think it gives the impression that the administration thinks that we’re “bad kids,” and even if that wasn’t what they meant. It’s like their saying that we don’t can’t make the right decisions for that kind of stuff, and we can do that, we go to boarding school.”\n**Kai Kornegay ’14:** \xa0“I think it’s important to note that a lot of what is considered “provocative” dancing is rooted in Afro and Carribean and Latino culture, and to say that “that’s not okay,” is erasing a lot of culture that students on campus have…And I think this is yet another decision this year that has been made to affect the students that has been done without our consultation.”\n**Kory Stuer ’15:”** I think less people will go because they want to hook up, and if they can’t hook up, if they can’t leave from a dance to hook up, they’ll just hook up anyways.

I was just so proud to be part of this team. It’s a nice recognition of the work we’ve been doing. It’s nice for someone to say ‘kudos’ and ‘job well done’,” said Gail Mansfield, Senior Associate Director of Major Gifts and Annual Giving.\n The Education Fundraising Award for Overall Performance is granted to educational institutions of 6,000 or more alumni that demonstrate superior fundraising programs, according to the CASE website. CASE has recognized scholastic programs and institutions annually since 1959. The three-year period that CASE judged coincided with The Campaign for Andover, which surpassed its $300 million dollar goal last November.\n “We continued to raise funds and do good work and good things. We persevered in a difficult economy, and we did a great job, which is recognized through this award,” said Mansfield.\n Nominees for the CASE Educational Fundraising Award for Overall Performance are determined by patterns of growth of support in donations, breadth of fundraising programs and total alumni support, according to the CASE website.\n\n', 'Oct 10, 2013'), ('\nThis Winter Term, Personal and Community Education (PACE) will add two new faculty and one more section, enabling the program to maintain a size of 11 or 12 students per section, said Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students and Personal and Community Education (PACE) Coordinator.\n PACE provides Lowers with a chance to discuss adolescent issues with faculty members and Seniors. Megan Paulson, Instructor in History, and Dr. Amy Patel, Medical Director, will join the team of PACE faculty. Paulson will teach a PACE section, adding to the program her love of conversing with students about controversial issues and her longtime Andover experience, said Hoyt. Patel will join Hoyt as a supervisor for the PACE Seniors in addition to teaching a PACE class. \n Hoyt, who was previously the sole advisor to PACE Seniors, said that he is looking forward to having both a male and female advisor to male and female PACE Seniors. “She will also be able to complement my clinical, psychological counseling perspective with her medical, health and wellness perspective, so it has already been great,” said Hoyt.\n\n', 'Oct 10, 2013'), ('\nBetter known as Jack, John Richards II, Instructor in History and Social Sciences from 1957 until 1997, passed away last Saturday at the age of 81. \n Besides teaching history, Richards served as Cluster Dean, Dean of Students and Dean of Faculty. Sitting on the steering committee that recommended coeducation and founding the country’s first USA-USSR high school exchange program, according to Andover’s website, he sought to bring dynamic thinking and innovation to each of his campus roles.\n Christopher Gurry ’66, Instructor in History and Social Science and one of Richards’s former students, called Richards a “model of the triple threat,” referring to his influence as a teacher, coach and house counselor. He recalled Richards’s unique ability to connect with students in his European history class. \n “At that time we sat in rows. He constantly walked around the classroom, engaging with each individual but not in an intimidating way. He used the Socratic method, so everyone came to class prepared because you knew that you would be called on. He invited students to be their best,” said Gurry. \n Richards served as a mentor and role model to many of his students, devoting time and effort to their success. His legacy as a teacher still remains on campus today, as four of Richards’s former students—Gurry, Vic Henningsen ’69, former Instructor in History, Edwin G. Quattlebaum ’60 III, former Instructor in History, and Derek Williams ’65, former Instructor in History—have since returned to teach at Andover all in his department. \n “That is a testament to him as well as some of his colleagues, but Jack is the guy that I admired and looked up to. He epitomized all that was good about Andover,” said Gurry. “He was the kind of person that expected everybody to be prepared and ready. And when you were not you really felt as if you had let him down. He was always on top of his game, and when you weren’t, you said to yourself, ‘Wow, I missed an opportunity.’”\n In his final weeks on campus, Richards shared with the department his vision of a new centennial multi-disciplinary course on World War I, highlighting events such as the Paris debut of Igor Stravinsky’s and Sergei Diaghilev’s 1913 ballet “The Rite of Spring” and the sinking of the Titanic, according to Christopher Shaw ’78, Chair and Instructor in History. \n “Just before his retirement in 1997, Richards was eager to be involved with new faculty, sharing new ideas and planning new approaches to the work that he had done with brilliance for decades. I remember thinking then that such positive energy seemed all too rare at his age,” said Shaw. “To the very end of his career here, he set the standard for creativity, innovation and cutting-edge pedagogy.”\n Richards had a particular passion for Russian history. While at Andover, teaching electives on both the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union. He also co-authored a book that was published in the 1970s, according to Gurry. He passed on this enthusiasm to his students, including the son of Peter Drench, Instructor in History and Social Science.\n “My son loved every minute of it and often shared some fun moments he’d enjoyed in that class. Thanks in part to his experience in Jack’s class and with Victor Svec [Instructor in Russian], he decided to major in Slavic Studies in college. Almost every time Jack and I conversed in the years that followed, he wanted to know how my son was doing,” said Drench.\n “For the past several years, I’ve been teaching in his former classroom, and, as a reminder of his kindness, I’ve kept on one of the walls’ two framed posters, one of Faberge eggs and the other of a beautiful Russian church,” continued Drench.\n A talented athlete, Richards served as the Captain of the Harvard track team. He later coached Andover Track, winning interscholastic championships in 1971 and 1972 and then five more from 1980 to 1984, said Gurry. \n “He really ran the gamut of things, and I guess that we always thought that we were fortunate to keep him so long, because I always felt that he would be an outstanding headmaster at some school, even here,” said Gurry.\n\n', 'Oct 10, 2013'), ('\nAs she rides on her bike across West Quad North withher distinct red mittens, Agatha Kip greets students crossing main street with an inviting smile and “hello.”\n Kip, Nutrition Counselor and Sports Dietitian, works with Isham Health Center and Paresky Commons to both promote healthy eating habits and educate Andover students and faculty about nutrition. Her role during her 33 years at Andover, however, encompassed much more than giving dietary advices. \n “I watch you all grow up, I watch you find your way. I may give a student advice in ninth grade, or twelfth grade, or in yoga class, or run into them in the salad bar, and [I love] somehow seeing, ‘How did they use that advice? Was it fruitful? If so, how?’” said Kip. \n Through her various additional roles on campus, such as House Counselor and Instructor in Yoga, Kip has built many memorable relationships on campus. \n Kips specifically recalls her students in Whitney House in 1997, when they helped Nicholas Kip, Instructor in Classics, propose to her, the start of their 16 year marriage. \n Nicholas Kip worked with the girls in the dorm to keep his proposal a surprise and to bring Aggie Kip to the common room. \n “One of the girls [in Whitney House] was a wonderful artist, and they made cute posters, and they had balloons, and it was really sweet. It was really very, very much like a family. I think when you have that, that’s a pivotal moment in life, to feel like where you are for your job is your home,” Kip said.\n She also remembers a group of boys who came to Bertha Bailey as juniors and stacked the dorm for the rest of their time at Andover. \n “They gave me flowers for Mothers’ Day, and the day they graduated, they gave me a huge bouquet and I remember I carried it when the kids were marching down the Great Lawn,” said Kip. \n In addition to the nutrition committee and her work-duty kids, Kip’s close relationships with students enable her to incorporate their suggestions into her work. \n “When we were coming up with the new menus, I insisted on putting on the Power Bar because students would always say, ‘Could we have different kinds or different flavors of hummus?’…every chance I have to change the menu, I include their suggestions,” Kip said. \n “All of you, even if you’re not athletes, you all really like high performance. You like when you can go to class and get through the day, even if it’s a long day, it’s important to you all, so that’s why I love to do this,” she continued.\n\n', 'Oct 10, 2013'), ("\nGrinding and students “who are not adequately clothed” are now explicitly banned from school dances, according to an e-mail from Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, this morning.\nExcerpts from the e-mail read:\n> _sexually suggestive dancing, including but not limited to grinding is not allowed.

We will be using the results that we currently have, and this will not be an issue anymore. I truly apologize to anyone that is upset that I closed the survey.”\n The mock survey also spurred a discussion about the necessity of superlatives at Andover. \n “I wondered out loud to [Stephanie] if Superlatives had run their course… bad behavior should never stop us from doing something that’s fun, but I think it’s always a good time to think, in a place like this where everyone is superlative, how can you decide who’s best dressed or who’s the nicest couple?” said Murphy. \n> because it was way more funny than it was offensive [#okimdone](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23okimdone&src=hash)\n>\n> — Melly Belly (@MelBel823) [September 29, 2013](https://twitter.com/MelBel823/statuses/384169822721826817)\n The survey elicited mixed reviews from the student body, particularly this year’s Senior class. \n “The only negative [side] I could see was that it got concentrated groups of people gossiping. Because it was sent out on a weekend, people had nothing better to do than to talk about who fit each category, but these are topics that come up in conversation all the time anyway,” said Bridget Higgins ’14.\n “From the author’s username and the circumstances, the whole thing was clearly a joke. Nobody specifically was put on the list; it was just the superlatives. I, nor any person I know, was personally attacked,” Joe Faller ’14 said.\n “Personally, I don’t love superlatives in general. They are just a popularity contest, and they don’t fit in with the Andover ideal. Some people aren’t happy to win that, and it adds a lot of drama, especially during Senior fall,” said Harry Wright ’14. \n The Technology Office sent a complaint to SurveyAct, the company that hosted the mock survey, claiming that this particular survey may have violated the website’s terms of service. The Technology Office is currently in talks with SurveyAct to find the identity of the survey’s creator. \n Murphy said he tried to contact c14ssyy@gmail.com directly, the account from which the survey was sent. His e-mails were, however, returned to the sender, indicating that the account was either disabled or fake. \n The creator(s) of the survey broke Andover’s “terms of decency,” which state that although only specific infractions are noted in the Blue Book, one’s “personal integrity” should steer one in all situations when representing the Phillips Academy community, said Murphy.\n As of now, the potential punishment for the perpetrator(s) if caught has yet to be determined.\n “You’ve really hurt people within the community for no real purpose…I’m just going to wait and see if we find out who it was and then, as we do in every discipline situation, I have to discuss it with the Deans, see what terms of acceptable use [the action] has violated,” said Murphy. \n\n', 'Oct 3, 2013'), ('\nEverett Gibson arrived at the Lyndon B. Johnson Spacecraft Center on the day that lunar spacecraft Apollo 11 returned to Earth in 1969. Four decades later, Gibson is now Principal Scientist of Astrobiology and Planetary Sciences at NASA and a senior scientist at the Manned Spacecraft Center. He is collaborating with his fellow scientists in the search for evidence of life on Mars through studying meteorites and the planet’s surface.\n Gibson spoke about Mars exploration and the possibility of biological existence on Mars on Tuesday in Gelb. \n “If we as a civilization and humanity discover that somewhere else in our Cosmos or solar system there could be life, that would really be a changing event both philosophically and scientifically,” said Gibson.\n From the evidence he has observed over his scientific career, Gibson personally believes that there used to be and there may currently be life on Mars.\n The most recent indication of life on Mars resulted from NASA’s rover “Curiosity.” In fall 2012, Curiosity detected rounded pebbles embedded in sections of Mars’ surface. Gibson said this suggested there used to be large amounts of water, as water is responsible for rounding the pebbles, said Gibson.\n “We have evidence that there are what looks like large outflow channels that have moved across the surface in the past, so we think that is was warmer and wetter in its history. We know there might have been oceans, and they have since gone,” said Gibson. \n After closer examination of these pebbles, Gibson said he and his team at NASA were also able to find many important elements for life including carbon, sulfur, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. Gibson said that for the last 3 billion years Mars has looked similar to how it looks now, with no obvious concrete signs of life. \n Gibson explained that there are three main components that are necessary to confirm that a place is habitable: liquid water, carbon and an energy source. Gibson said that the energy source of Mars is the sun, so NASA scientists have been following trails of carbon and water to try to find evidence of life on Mars \n Following the success of the Curiosity rover, Gibson spoke about the possibility of NASA sending a new rover to Mars in the year 2020. This rover will act similarly to Curiosity and will specifically help to search for additional evidence of life. \n Gibson said that out of the 44 attempted rover launches to Mars, only 18 missions have successfully landed there. Gibson said that he worked on two of the failed missions. “It hurts when you lose a spacecraft, even though it is 250 million miles away,” said Gibson.\n NASA has been sending rovers to Mars since the 1960s in an effort to find past or present evidence of life.\n Although there has been some success landing rovers on Mars, additional evidence of possible life has come from meteorites found on the earth’s surface. Gibson said that there are seven meteorites that display confirmed Martian qualities. A meteorite found in Egypt had traces of Martian water, as isotopes of oxygen that made up the water were different from any water found on earth. \n “On Earth we know that we have carbon sources that are already available and we have life everywhere and anywhere. On Mars, it is more difficult. There are no we like to detect footprints and fossils.…On Mars, we have to look at it with greater scrutiny,” said Gibson.\n In addition to the presentation, Gibson spoke at an informal dinner discussion at Paresky Commons, hosted an event in the Gelb Observatory and also spoke to two astronomy classes. “I thought Gibson was engaging, and it is an interesting topic, so I think the students enjoyed it,” said Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics.\n Odden invited Gibson to campus. “I met Dr. Gibson several years ago at a conference and it was apparent to me immediately that he was very intelligent, very knowledgeable and an engaging fellow. So I had been hoping to get him to campus for quite some time,” said Odden.\n Gibson has a professorship at the Open University in the United Kingdom, where he works with graduate students. He received BS and MS degrees in Chemistry from Texas Tech University and a PhD in Geochemistry, specializing in meteorites, from Arizona State University.\n\n', 'Oct 3, 2013'), ('\nHaving grown up in Germany, but originally of Iranian descent, Djavaneh Bierwirth ’14 relied on the Internet as her sole means of communication with her Iranian relatives. When government censorship restricted Iranian access to such avenues in 2001, Bierwirth became intrigued by the restrictions on the use of technology in 21st century Iran.\n Bierwirth’s CAMD Scholar presentation, “The Green Movement: An Examination of Online Media Censorship and its Implications on the Political Sphere of 21st-Century Iran,” focused on the role that the internet had on the Green Movement. The movement disputed the validity of the 2009 Iranian presidential elections and compared the censorship climate then with that of the current day.\n Organizationally, the Green Movement relied so heavily on the Internet and social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, that it was dubbed the “Twitter Revolution” by many news organizations. \n While Bierwirth stressed the impact of the Internet as a means of communicating and organizing social movements and revolutions, she concluded that the Internet and social networks were only catalysts for the revolutions and did not create the political unrest themselves.\n Following the Green Movement, however, the government became more strict with its censors, as well as more sophisticated in its blocking methods.\n Foodporn.com, for example, a website that shows pictures of attractive foods, was blocked pre-2009 by a system that censored websites based on keywords found. However, after 2009, when government filters could recognize both keywords and content, the site was available again. \n “I hoped to highlight that the Internet is a tremendous resource, especially for us students at PA. I wanted call attention to the fact that access to a free Internet is not the case in every country,” said Bierwirth.\n After talking to Reza Aslan, religious scholar and Founder of “Aslan Media,” an online newspaper focused on the Middle East, who visited Andover last year, Bierwirth decided to specifically concentrate on the impact the Internet and online media censorship had on the Iranian Green Movement.\n A native speaker of Farsi and English, Bierwirth examined documents, books and websites written in both languages for her research. \n “As is often the case with reading reports in different languages, a lot can be lost in translation. In particular, the Iranian state media’s portrayal of the Green Movement showed a radically different perspective on many of the issues. Western-based websites such as ‘Reporters Without Borders’ are a lot less restricted in their ability to condemn many of the government’s actions in regards to violations of press freedom,” said Bierwirth.\n Although Bierwirth had originally planned to travel to Iran to interview different students at the University of Iran to discuss their impressions and reactions to the Green Movement, safety concerns prevented her from doing so. \n “It was difficult for me to arrange a time to safely travel to Iran. On the one hand, concerns arose leading up to the 2013 election, for many people believed that protests would follow the election regardless of the candidate that would be put into office,” said Bierwirth. \n Susan Torabi worked with Bierwirth as her faculty advisor for the project. “Both of us share a personal connection to the topic. Her mom is from Iran and so is my husband. I think both DJ and I regret how isolated this beautiful country, so rich in history and culture, has become over the past decades. We both have family there and wished that it were easier to travel there as well as for Iranians to leave the country,” said Torabi.\n\n', 'Oct 3, 2013'), ('\nAccess to news is constantly evolving in the Information Age. Social media and the rise of citizen journalism have forced traditional media outlets to rethink their framework. Despite these shifts, journalists Jonathan Alter ’75, Susan Chira ’76 and scientist Joseph Salvo ’76 agreed that the Internet will not replace traditional journalism. \n The three discussed the future of media and communication on the “Communication Complication: Taking on the World Bit by Byte” panel last Friday. “New York Times” best-selling author Alter is a former Senior Editor and Columnist at “Newsweek,” Chira is an Assistant Managing Editor at “The New York Times” and Salvo is a research scientist at General Electric. \n With the rise of the Internet and social media, newspapers have been forced to become more dynamic, using video, audio and social media to engage readers and convey information, the panelists said. \n While she was the Deputy Foreign Editor at “The New York Times,” Chira instituted a team of re-writers at the major foreign bureaus, who updated stories online while foreign correspondents collected information.\n “In terms of the content, which is what I work in, you really have to try to wrestle with the idea of, ‘How do you take an organization that was built and organized around a daily deadline at a fixed point in time, that resulted in a print paper at one fixed point in time, and transform it into a 24-hour news organization that holds true to its values of depth and analysis while adding speed and maintaining accuracy?’” Chira said. \n Using the cell phone as an example, Salvo contextualized the rapid pace of technology developments today. \n “[The first cell phones] were quite unintelligent. They were basically a box and a radio. It did not take long, because of Moore’s law, which says that computing power doubles every 18 months, to start to integrate more and more intelligence into [phones… now], the Earth is filled with cell phones, and they’re in the billions now. There are more cell phones in China than people in United States, and it shows no sign of waning,” Salvo said. \n “We are really on the dawn of this new concept, the Industrial Internet…What we are eventually trying to do is allow minds and machines to collaborate on a global knowledge network,” continued Salvo.\n Rather than providing the source of the information itself, as traditional news sources do, the Internet is useful for spreading information, thanks to the rise of citizen journalists. “Citizen journalism” refers to the accumulation and distribution of information and news by the general public, rather than official journalists. Although social media has essentially allowed anyone with a smartphone to “report” breaking news firsthand, Chira said that traditional journalism is necessary to verify and analyze information. \n “One of the problems with the Internet is the absolute volume of things of low quality. Being able to actually find things that are of high quality that people are willing to pay for, that is the value of a publication,” Salvo added.\n Alter added that the basic “building blocks” of good journalism—“clear writing, clear thinking”—remain unchanged by the advent of technology. \n “Talk is cheap and reporting is expensive. Anybody can blog and drop either something valuable or poisonous into the global bloodstream now,” said Alter. “When people are attitudinizing or developing a take on something or linking, what they’re not doing is reporting.”\n Although the Internet will allow greater access to information, Chira, Salvo and Alter agreed that the Internet will not replace the traditional education system. \n Chira said, “In my role at ‘The Times,’ I’ve overseen a lot of writing about online learning, or the massive online courses, and I see a certain power in those… but what I cherished at Andover was the human connection. I think that the power of a teacher to talk to and inspire another human being is very difficult to transmit in a solely virtual way. And I don’t see how to replace that kind of relationship with technology.” \n The panel, funded by an Abbot Academy Association Grant, was organized and co-moderated by Joey Salvo ’14, Commentary Editor for The Phillipian, and Gary Lee ’74, former writer at “Time Magazine” and “The Washington Post” and chair of The Phillipian’s advisory board.\n\n', 'Oct 3, 2013'), ('\nA political junkie during her time at Andover, Noelle Selin ’96 never imagined herself diving into the scientific field. However, 17 years after her graduation, she is combining science with her passion for politics to help solve today’s global environmental problems.\n As the second and final speaker in the 2013 Kaleidoscope All School Meeting (ASM) Series, Selin, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Assistant Professor of Engineering Systems and Atmospheric Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), proposed a “win-win” solution to health and climate problems caused by air pollutants, as outlined in last week’s presentation by Bruce Anderson ’90. \n “I like to refer to [the climate change problem] as a ‘Common Resources Problem.’ The idea behind the ‘Common Resources Problem’ is that I get all the benefit when I turn on the light bulb, but the burden is spread across the world,” said Selin. \n She stressed the importance of understanding all components of the “Common Resources Problem” in order to come up with a plausible and effective solution. \n Referring to a report published last year by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Selin said countries must devise an interdisciplinary solution to simultaneously reduce air pollution and restore the climate.\n “No one solution is the magic bullet that’s going to create this low-carbon future… The [possible solutions] just help us take the first steps in the [short term] to transitioning to a low carbon economy,” Selin said. \n “I always try to trace the data through the whole chain to understand the problem better: from policies to emissions, emissions to concentrations, concentrations to impacts and impacts to policy responses,” she continued. \n The escalating amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere has damaged both the climate and human health. Out of the 56 million deaths every year, over 7 million are attributed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution, said Selin. \n The majority of the world’s population lives in a small part of Asia, where the CO2 emission per capita is much lower than that of the United States, Australia or Saudi Arabia. Thus, the majority of the world’s population is bearing the brunt of an environmental problem that they did not have a large part in creating. \n Approximately 1000 gigatonnes of carbon can be burned and released into the atmosphere before Earth’s temperature rises by two degrees, a critical point that scientists agree could drastically affect life on Earth. Of the 1000 gigatonnes, 531 have already been released, according to Selin. \n “Two degrees [difference] has been agreed upon as [the marker of] dangerous climate change. All sorts of unacceptable consequences kick in after an increase of two degrees, such as sea level rise and ocean acidification,” said Selin. \n Among other projects, Selin is currently working with colleagues from MIT in Saudi Arabia to collect data and develop a plan to aid the transition into a post-fossil fuel economy.\n At MIT, Selin specializes in atmospheric chemistry modeling to aid decision-making regarding air pollution, climate change and pollutants such as mercury. Yesterday, Selin traveled to Japan to attend the signing of a global convention on mercury. She received her PhD from Harvard University in Earth and Planetary Sciences.\n\n', 'Oct 3, 2013'), ('\nAs Biology 560 students filed into the classroom, Jeremiah Hagler pulled up an article from “Science” magazine about the effects of grassland predators on their ecosystem to illustrate the real-life application of the concepts students had learned. \n Now in his 14th year at Andover, Hagler, Instructor and Chair in Biology and Head of the Division of Natural Sciences, has taught courses ranging from Biology 100 to the Biology 560/570/580 sequence, which are advanced classes for Uppers and Seniors. \n Though Hagler teaches these courses with firm dedication to real-life application, his talents seem to lie at the crossroads of multiple disciplines. In his time here, he has created three interdisciplinary courses with the Department of History and Social Science, Graham House and the Peabody Museum. \n “Dr. Hagler has a real interest in working across departments. He is a really creative thinker with great enthusiasm for everything. He really loves new ideas [and] loves to combine subjects to create something different,” said Marcelle Doheny, Instructor in History and Social Science, who teaches the interdisciplinary course in Biology and History, “Disease and Medicine in the United States,” with Hagler. \n Keith Robinson, Instructor in Biology, said that the Biology Department has been trying to incorporate more interdisciplinary work into its courses since Hagler became the Department Chair in 2010. \n “I think Hagler has helped pave the way for other biology teachers to come up with their own interdisciplinary courses. And it seems that kids really enjoy these courses—they have a flavor to them that is different from a yearlong course in just biology,” Robinson said. \n Before coming to Andover, Hagler worked at the Harvard University Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Lab as a postdoctoral fellow. According to Hagler, working in a lab is extremely time-intensive, demanding up to 80 hours every week. He said that when he and his wife had a set of triplets in 1998, devoting that much time to work became difficult.\n “Around this time, I came across an advertisement in ‘Science’ magazine for a visiting science position at PA, so I decided to use this opportunity to make a shift out of hard science and try teaching,” he said.\n Hagler became part of the Andover community in 2000 as a Visiting Scholar in Science, running the Biology Independent Research elective for five years before becoming a full-time faculty member.\n “I love sharing my enthusiasm in biology with the kids. Interacting with students, getting them to really think about issues in science, how to approach the world, how to look at the world—it’s great fun,” Hagler said.\n Hagler said he particularly loves watching his students mature throughout their four years at Andover.\n “What Phillips Academy does really well is laying the ground for the kids to successfully mature without being sidetracked,” said Hagler.\n “We don’t hold [the students’] hands and tell [them] what to do at all steps of the way. We guide [them]. We function as parents, but one step removed, and I think this is actually an ideal arrangement that allows students to bloom,” he continued.\n Hagler enjoys teaching both Biology 100 and Biology 560. “I love teaching 9th graders. They’re funny, open-minded, excited about the world and kind of goofy, and I’m a little goofy, so it works pretty well,” he said. \n “[Biology] 560 students are top-notch, pretty high-performing science students. You can get them to learn a lot of stuff, really explore the world, really learn some deeper concepts about how biology or how science works, which you might not be able to teach to Bio 100 students,” Hagler said. \n While watching each of his own daughters Alexia, Michaela and Samantha Hagler, all Class of 2016, experience their own, special versions of Andover life, Hagler has gained an insight into the school that he could not acquire as a faculty member. \n Hagler said that he noticed the variability in teaching styles of faculty at the school, both throughout the school and within each department.\n “I see three students simultaneously going through the system with three different teachers in all of the departments, so I have seen a huge cross section of what happens at this school. Is the [variability] always great? Not necessarily, but every experience my kids have is unique and valuable,” he said. \n Although Hagler believes that Andover provides an exciting and nurturing environment for students, he sometimes finds the academic workload concerning. \n “If I could compare my kids’ high school experiences with my own high school experience, [mine] was a lot of fun, [with] marching band, pep rallies and a lot of sports games,” he said. \n “This school is more study-serious. Although that is actually good in the long run, the [students] are still teenagers and the workload could lighten up a little bit,” he continued.\n Aside from his duties as a teacher, Hagler coaches Girls JV Basketball in the winter and officiates track meets in the spring. He and his wife live in America House, a Junior boys dorm, with their triplet daughters.\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nMembers of Student Council unanimously voted to alter Andover’s Student Council Constitution on September 19, 2013.\n In addition to reformatting the document to reflect the current Co-Presidential structure, Student Council decided to create a Junior Board, from which Junior Representatives will be elected in the winter, and include Cluster Presidents in the council.\n Junior Board\n Instead of immediately electing three year-long class representatives in the first week of school, Juniors will now elect representatives from each dorm and two day students to serve on the Junior Board for the Fall Term only. During the Winter Term, Juniors will elect three members from the Board to serve as class representatives in the Student Council. \n “The mentality behind this measure is that because the new ninth graders have had little opportunity to get to know their classmates, they have had little opportunity to gauge these classmates’ leadership skills. With the new Junior Board, the ninth graders will have a term to evaluate the qualifications of their peers before electing them,” said Junius Williams ’14, School Co-President.\n “The Council hopes that the Junior Board will provide a forum for real leadership to develop in the Junior Class before Junior Representative elections occur in early December,” Clark Perkins ’14, School Co-President, said. \n Cluster Presidents\n Cluster Presidents will become members of Student Council starting next February.\n Williams said, “The goal of this measure was to increase communication between the Cluster Councils and the overarching Student Council. With the cluster presidents as members of Student Council, it becomes easier for us to delegate and legislate through Cluster Council.”\n This change will allow cluster presidents to voice the specific interest of their own cluster and the three Senior Representatives to focus on the needs of the Senior class.\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nDr. Richard Keller, former Medical Director at Isham Health Center, is planning to retract his original plea of innocence to the possession and receipt of child pornography. Keller was arrested on September 13, 2012 and charged with two counts of receiving child pornography and one count of possessing child pornography, according to “The Eagle Tribune.”\n Over the last several months, federal prosecutors and Keller’s attorney have been working to finalize a plea deal regarding the case. A plea deal is a negotiation between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant agrees to plead guilty to all or some of his charges in return for a concession from the prosecutor. Keller and his attorney asked to schedule a change-of-plea hearing next month to work out retraction details, according to “Fox News.” It is still unknown whether or not Keller will plead guilty to all three charges.\n Over 100 DVDs of child pornography and 500 explicit photos of boys from ages 7 to 16 were discovered in Keller’s home last September. Some of these items were delivered to Isham Health Center, according to an affidavit issued by the U.S. Attorneys’ Office.

Tutors also often did not wear the mandatory identification badges that were given to them at the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library circulation desk when they checked in. \n Davison said that some students may have been benefitting from outside tutors, but there was no designated Andover personnel to oversee the tutor program. \n Russell said the school encourages students to use the resources available on campus, such as conference periods, peer tutors, the writing centers, librarians and study centers, to meet their academic support needs. Andover’s Academic Skills Center provides organizational and time management skills to students as well. \n “I’m aware that people will continue to want this service, but many tutors use skype already anyways. We can’t prohibit someone from [being tutored] in their own time in their own space. But I’d like to think the result is that students will use the internal support systems offered by the school,” said Davison. \n If students wanted to meet outside tutors in town or over skype, it is not the schools’ responsibility and does not fall under the campus ban. “It is not the schools’ responsibility if the tutoring takes place in a public venue. That is between parents and students only,” said Russell. \n Davison said the the former extensive background checks were time consuming and costly. Under Massachusetts law, schools are required to screen employees and volunteers who will have direct unsupervised contact with students. CORI (Massachusetts Criminal Offender Record Information) and SORI (Nationwide Sex Offender Registry Information) were two of the background checks that required completion before the outside tutor stepped on campus. \n The tests were provided through the Human Resources Department, who would pay for the CORI and SORI checks to be administered. “It felt like we were implicitly supporting the presence of tutors on our campus, almost sanctioning it even though we didn’t agree.” said Davison.\n The Academic Council consists of department and division chairs led by Russell.\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nLast Thursday, Pine Knoll Cluster (PKN) launched its own website to boost cluster spirit and promote communication between students.

Structurally, the Office has also established what it considers a more equitable first-come-first-serve sign up policy for all programs. \n Shortage of Resources\n Perhaps the greatest constraint the Community Service Office faces is a lack of time, funding and supervision for service programs. \n “There are factors that do prevent us from letting 1,200 kids participate in community service… It’s great that kids want to be involved, and hopefully, in the next couple of years, we can think about expanding our program in a safe and effective way,” said Cueto-Potts.\n Cueto-Potts said that finding non-conflicting times for new community service programs is the greatest barrier in expanding offerings. Most students at Andover only have Wednesday afternoons free from classes, but these are often filled with athletic games and commitments. In reality, only students who are sliding or taking morning basics have free afternoons for community service. \n Resolving previous safety concerns, this is the first year that all community service programs will have adult supervision, in large part due to the creation of a work-release program for faculty and staff who volunteer. The work-release pilot program, suggested by Head of School John Palfrey and coordinated by Cueto-Potts and the Office of the Dean of Faculty, gives interested staff and administrators time off to supervise community service programs each term.\n Lack of Depth\n Every community service program conducted a mandatory orientation session at the beginning of the term to educate the programs’ participants and establish a sense of responsibility, according to Sarah Coghlan, Assistant Director of Community Service. \n “What we’ve been doing up until now was plopping students into organizations and communities that they may or may not be familiar with, and that’s really irresponsible. We’ve been doing a lot of service, but not much explicit learning,” said Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Service. \n “[At orientation,] we worked more with the students to contextualize what they were doing, why it’s important, [and] why it’s a good thing to do,” said Coghlan. \n In preparation for these orientation sessions, coordinators were asked to delve into their programs’ social areas. For example, ARC, one of Andover’s largest community service groups, educated its volunteers on the prevalence of disability rights and ableism within the state and country, according to Cueto-Potts. \n “You don’t want to send someone into something without having them know what it entails. Also, there’s vital information in addition to contextualizing the importance of the issue the people are working with that needs to be communicated,” said Coghlan.\n Overcrowding\n In addition to mandating orientation sessions, the Community Service Office also decided to reduce the number of volunteers in four service programs where volunteers had previously far outnumbered participants. The four programs are Andover Chinese Cultural Outreach (ACCO), ARC, YDO Destination Imagination and YDO Science. \n ARC saw the most drastic cuts of the four, with 60 less volunteers enrolled for this Fall Term compared to last Spring Term. Each Andover student volunteering in ARC is paired with a mentally or physically disabled ‘buddy’ and they spend Tuesday nights in various bonding activities.\n “Because there were only 30 to 40 people with disabilities, it didn’t make any sense to have three to four people working with each of them. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of the program, with them not forming actual connections,” said said Nya Hughes ’15, one of the ARC Program coordinators. \n “People would be talking about their boyfriends around their buddies, completely ignoring their buddies, hanging out with their friends… We had to cut it to a number where it was safe and where we could watch the buddies and the PA volunteers,” Hughes continued. \n During the ARC orientation specifically, returning volunteers were partnered with their buddies from the previous year and were given the new guidelines and expectations for the program, said Hughes. It was announced that ARC will no longer be a term-contained service program, but will require that all volunteers commit for the entire year in order to form more meaningful relationships. \n Favoritism\n This fall, the Department implemented an online first-come-first-serve sign-up system. In previous years, sign-up numbers were compiled on the last day of sign-ups, which sometimes resulted in long waitlists for certain programs and a bias within the placement system. \n “Up until last winter, the office would collect signups, send them to the student coordinators and the student coordinators would sort of hand pick who they wanted in their programs,” said Cueto-Potts. \n The new system allowed the department to keep a daily record of the number of volunteers enrolled in each program. Waitlists are now shorter than ever, since students are able to see immediately which programs are full and sign up for another, said Cueto-Potts, In addition, the community service coordinators no longer had influence on the volunteer-picking process.\n Some students with sixth lunch were unable to sign up for programs of their choice because the sign up booths closed before sixth period started on Tuesday and some programs, such as Science Club for Girls, were full by Wednesday, said Claire Carroll ’14, Science Club for Girls coordinator.\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nStarting next week, all students will have free access to personalized SAT and ACT test preparation on Blackboard. The practice is provided by the College Counseling Office through through Prepworks, a Miami-based test-prep company. \n Prepworks allows students to take practice tests and move through the program in an individualized way, depending their strengths and weaknesses, said Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling. \n Not only will Prepworks’ online platform be convenient for students with busy schedules, it will also appear on students’ Blackboard desktops for broader accessibility.\n “Preparation for standardized testing is similar to any test you take at Andover. If you want to do well, you have to study,” said Logan. \n Andover has previously offered free test preparation, although it was not widely advertised. In the past, Summit Test Prep administered free SAT and ACT practice tests in mid-January. Summit would then offer a follow-up class after the tests at a cost to the participants.\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nTo help the audience understand human environmental impact, Bruce Anderson ’90 showed artistic representations of water usage around the country and carbon emission from airplanes, illustrating the intricate webs of interdependency between humans and environmental resources.\nAs part of the third annual Kaleidoscope Series, Anderson, an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University, highlighted the difficulties posed by the growing environmental crisis, the importance of innovative solutions and the complexities of climate change at All-School Meeting (ASM) on Wednesday.\nAnderson said that this generation has the responsibility to solve the “Super Wicked Problem” of global climate change.\n“The ‘Super Wicked Problem’ is essentially novel and unique, we have never seen it before and we’ll never see it ever again; the people who are trying to fix it are also contributing to it,” said Anderson. “Complex interdependencies between one component of the ‘Super Wicked Problem’ and other components of the ‘Super Wicked Problem’ make it an interrelated set of problems.”\nHe emphasized that helping the general public understand the significance of climate change is crucial in finding a solution to the issue, which will affect our own social and natural systems.\n“It is not going to be scientists or engineers who are going to solve this ‘Super Wicked Problem.’ In more cases than not, it will be historians, journalists, writers or artists: people who can change people’s perspectives on the world that we live in,” said Anderson.\n“In the end, it’s going to be your generation that brings a unique perspective on why climate change is a problem, because our generation has failed, even after talking about this for 40 years,” he continued.\nAnderson stressed the urgency of finding solutions to tackle climate change soon, referencing scientists who have provided ample data that demonstrates what will happen if current energy consumption—primarily of coal and oil—remains constant.\n\xa0\n\nFlight Patterns\n\xa0\n“Not only do we have to account for our activities on the earth, but have to pay attention to what is going [on] with beyond the planet, the sun, inside the planet, volcanism, poles and ice sheets, and under the crust, chemistry and biology of soils. All of these subsets intertwined make up our complex environment,” said Anderson. In contrast to last year’s Kaleidoscope All-School Meeting series which featured two speakers of opposing ideologies, this year’s speakers collaborated on their presentations. Following Anderson’s speech setting up the scientific background of the issue of climate change, Noelle Eckley Selin ’96 will discuss possible solutions to the problem next week.\n“We want the first half of Kaleidoscope to be the frame, to tell the students the essentials of what they should know about the energy and climate dynamic and how it stands in the world now,” said Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students and ASM Coordinator.\n“Bruce knows our school, he knows what it’s like to be a student here and he has come back and actually talked to students. He was just in a wonderful position to do the first part of the Kaleidoscope this time around,” said Hoyt. Anderson also spoke on the topic of climate change on campus in January 2011.\nIn addition to teaching at Boston University, Anderson also works with the public sector on problems related to climate variability. He specializes in water systems, such as hurricanes, super typhoons and mid-winter storms.\n\xa0\n\n', 'Sep 26, 2013'), ('\nBill Scott, Instructor and Chair in Math, announced on Thursday that Andover’s Math Department will partner with Khan Academy to create a calculus course for the website, offering free video lessons and practice problems online.\n “We are a private school with a public purpose. It has been in our charter forever, and if we are truly a private school with a public purpose, then it is our duty to go beyond the walls of our school,” said Scott. “The opportunity through the platform of Khan Academy to provide our calculus curriculum outside the ‘Andover Bubble,’ would allow us to hit the world for free, which is very much in the spirit of Non Sibi.”\n This partnership has been in the works since last Spring after Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, visited campus. Following the visit, the math department began to write calculus problems, 150 of which were uploaded to Khan Academy this summer as a trial. \n The tremendous success of those initial trial problems are the foundation for this new partnership, as Andover’s calculus content got hundreds of thousands of views without any promotion at all. Although August is Khan Academy website’s slowest month, the problems got 120,000 hits from 12,000 people. Statistically speaking, this means that 12,000 unique visitors went online and tried 10 problems each, on average, according to Scott. \n “We just put the problems online and collected data. I think that speaks for itself for how successful this partnership could be,” said Scott. \n Andover’s calculus courses have long been a strength of the Math Department. This past year, 90 percent of Andover’s BC Calculus students received a 5, the highest grade possible, on the AP Exam. Nationally, that percentage stands at around 45 percent of all students who take the AP. \n Nevertheless, the success of the summer trial might promise greater benefits for the Math Department, as Khan Academy’s high traffic can allow for more in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the department’s curriculum. \n “Khan Academy just provides such a wonderful platform for constructive analysis,” said Scott. “The metrics are incredibly helpful.”\n Scott also hopes that the Math Department might be able to eventually get rid of textbooks and put all of its resources online. \n This past summer, Scott and Chris Odden, Instructor in Math, traveled to California to attend a teacher workshop with Khan Academy. There they held meetings to discuss a partnership in which Andover would provide calculus content.\n Although Scott was enthusiastic about the idea, he said Andover would collaborate only under the condition that there was a consensus within the Math Department itself, since the faculty would be creating the actual calculus content.\n This collaboration is one of many other partnerships that may extend the reach and influence of Andover’s calculus content beyond campus. Allan Scheier, former Visiting Scholar in Mathematics from Lawrence High School, is teaching BC Calculus at Lawrence High School, and Andover is supporting his efforts to try to provide a Distance Learning Scholar Program, according to Scott. \n “Our goal is to provide both graduates of the Mathematics and Science for Minority Students (MS2) Program and also students of Lawrence High School with an online calculus option during their Senior year of high school at their home schools,” said Scott.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nIn the midst of a transition to technology-based curricula across campus, Kevin Cardozo, Instructor in Chemistry, has created Non Sibi High School, a site that moves Andover’s chemistry textbooks—written by Cardozo and complete with original lessons and problems—online for anyone’s use. Cardozo began writing content and constructing the webpage for Non Sibi High School in the spring of 2012 after receiving an Abbot grant for the project. “The light bulb went off in my head that we should be making PA’s high-quality educational materials available to any student, anywhere,” said Cardozo, who was inspired by the Khan Academy model of open access to education. He hopes that the free problems and review will not only help Andover students, but will help students attending schools without advanced Chemistry courses prepare for the Chemistry AP and SAT exams. “I thought ‘Non Sibi’ in the name would be highly appropriate because its meaning, ‘not for self,’ captures my strong belief that education should not be about making a profit. The best possible education should not be available only to those who can pay the most or those who have connections to an exclusive network of schools, but instead it should be available to all students,” he added. Non Sibi High School currently offers a free complete online textbook equivalent to Chemistry 250. The Chemistry 300 textbook, though available online, currently has two chapters missing and will be complete in October, while the Chemistry 550 textbook has yet to be written and will not be fully available until Fall 2014. “No other single free resource includes all the Chemistry topics we’d like students to learn at PA. I wanted to create a free ‘one-stop shopping’ resource for thorough coverage of all our desired topics that presents college-level material in a way that is age-appropriate for high school students,” continued Cardozo. The Chemistry Department currently uses college textbooks that often confuses students with their excess information, according to Cardozo. The succinct nature of the online textbook means that students can understand the material and can spend less time reading outside of class. “The material is much more concise and straight to the point. It’s less reading, yet still teaches the same amount of information,” said Victoria Bergeron ’16, who is using the online textbook in Cardozo’s Chemistry 300 class. With a more readable textbook online, Cardozo is able to use the “Flipped Classroom” method, in which students learn the class material in the evenings for homework. Cardozo said that when students come to class with an understanding of the assigned topic already, the class can effectively spend the majority of the period practicing problems instead of requiring students to listen to a lecture each day. “It makes sense to decrease time demands on students outside of class, while at the same time using class time much more productively, and the website is one way to help bring about this change,” said Cardozo. Additionally, switching to free online materials instead of relying on paper chemistry books from publishing houses makes chemistry courses considerably more affordable for students, and could save Andover’s financial aid budget tens of thousands of dollars each year, according to Cardozo. “As for accessibility, Non Sibi High School is great because it is online, so as long as you have a smartphone or mobile device you can access it anywhere on campus instead of having to lug around a huge, heavy, hardcover Chem textbook,” said Marcello Rossi ’16, a Chemistry 300 student. Cardozo has already stopped using the paper textbook for his Chemistry 300 class and plans to do the same in Chemistry 550 next year when the online textbook is finished. “I’m hoping that others in the Chemistry Department will join me in abandoning paper textbooks completely and using free online materials instead, which I believe could be much more effective for student learning,” Cardozo added. Cardozo received assistance in the making of the website from friends and family members who would like to remain anonymous. Instead of naming individuals, the website lists and gives credit to the colleges they attended.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\n_In light of the four separate initiatives to put Andover curricula and coursework online, _The Phillipian _reached out to Head of School John Palfrey with questions on the future of technology in the classroom. Palfrey agreed to an e-mail interview on Thursday._ **Andover’s approach to teaching,** especially **in the STEM disciplines, is arguably traditional—the teacher stands at the front of the classroom and lectures a seated group of students. Do you imagine Andover changing to a “flipped classroom” model in the future?**\n John Palfrey: I disagree a bit with your premise: I don’t think there’s all that much “lecture” at Phillips Academy, at least compared to what you will experience in higher education. For my own part, I do prefer flipping the classroom whenever lecture is called for, though. I’d much prefer that students do any passive-type learning in preparation for class and emphasize interactive, creative, Socratic, and other forms of learning during class-time. That’s a personal preference as a teacher (and as an administrator: this week’s faculty meeting adopts a flipped classroom approach), but I know it can work when used well. Other teachers will need to make their own choices in this respect. I suspect you’ll see a fair amount of flipping when you get to university.\n**Yvonne Chan, who spoke alongside you in the NYTimes panel, mentioned that “high school definitely must take the responsibility to make sure [students are] confident online learners.” While many Andover students are confident in their ability to navigate technology, do you think Andover successfully refines these skills?**\n JP: I don’t think we yet do enough in this respect. I imagine that Andover students are by and large very capable in using technology in many ways. But taking an online course, for instance, involves different kinds of learning than taking in-person courses. I expect that most students at Andover now will take at least one online course in college — if not more than one — and then again in graduate school, in the workplace for professional development, and so forth. I’d like to see us do more to prepare you for that future. I think the librarians, the academic skills center team, and other educators on campus can also help a lot in these respects.\n**The use of technology in a number of Andover’s classrooms has been heightened in the past three years. This year, various History 100 and Biology 100 classes have gone paperless, substituting textbooks for iPads. How does the school go about evaluating the success of these programs? Do the benefits outweigh the cost?**\n JP: Great question. We need to do good assessment of any experimentation, and we are. We did early forms of assessment of the iPad pilots last year and will expand that assessment this year. Mike Barker, our new director of Institutional Research, was hired in no small part to get this work done, along with Rachel Skiffer, our dean of policy and strategic planning, in conjunction with departments, teachers, and students. We are a leader already in terms of assessment of our teaching and learning and I’d like to see us build on this success.\n**Andover’s recent technology initiatives have been isolated to specific courses or departments. How do you plan on tying all of the recent pilot programs (iPad pilots, Sal Khan collaboration) together?**\n JP: I’m not sure they will all be “tied together.” I think teaching is often discipline specific. It’s clear, to me anyway, that there are great benefits to online teaching in much of math, statistics, computer sciences, much of science offerings, and languages, for instance. The case for online teaching to support the humanities and the arts, music, and theater is a harder one to make — though there are terribly exciting things happening in, say, the digital humanities space and in terms of new kinds of textbooks for offerings like History 300. We’ll do lots of different experiments and we will figure out where technology works and where it does not. But we will never deploy technology across the board for its own sake. Our focus in on your experience as learners, not on the technology itself. We will join these efforts through good assessment and constantly monitoring what’s working and what isn’t.\n**The sharing of free content online is becoming more and more popular among education institutions and organizations. Through projects like Kevin Cardozo’s “Non Sibi High School” and Nina Scott’s collaboration with CK-12, even Andover has begun contributing to the growing pool of free, online academic resources. What do you foresee as the role of schools and universities in this growing trend of cost-free education?**\n JP: I see it as a great way for us to live our motto of non sibi. We can be a private school with a public purpose in new ways. Your two examples are great ones, as is the example of the Math Department’s work with Khan Academy on the BC calculus curriculum. I think these initiatives can be a breakthrough efforts.\n**Recording and publishing lectures and seminars online, at no cost to the viewer, is a growing trend among higher education institutions. Would this model also be appropriate for Andover?**\n JP: Maybe, to some extent. But again, we don’t have many in the way of true lecture courses. So I am much more attracted to the Khan Academy model, say, than the classic video-lecture-based course. The emphasis will need to be on interactivity, great problems, data-driven personalization and improvements of the questions, and so forth. And I think we will end up re-affirming the model of residential education, even as we build out in these exciting ways into cyberspace to share what’s great about Andover with others and to bring back learning from elsewhere to our own campus.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nHoping to use technology as means of providing all students with high-quality resources, Nina Scott, Instructor in English, plans to make her journalism textbook available for free online by the end of Fall Term. Scott originally wrote the textbook in 2007 solely as class material for her English 514 Journalism elective. While Scott initially wanted to digitize the book to supplement her class’ curriculum, her plans shifted when she was inspired by CK-12, a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide both students and teachers with high-quality open-source content online for free. After attending a workshop with the organization at Choate Rosemary Hall this June, Scott met with several representatives of CK-12 at the Technology in the Classroom workshop, including Juli Weiss, P ’05. They soon convinced her to make her textbook available on their website. “Their ‘non sibi’ and their vision so matched Phillips Academy’s motto ‘private school with a public purpose’ that I was willing to give my book to them… if it helped them in any way,” said Scott. “Getting information, quality information, out there to people who are interested—what could be better?” said Scott. Scott hopes her book will be able to help students who do not have the same opportunity as Andover students to explore their interests in journalism. Eventually, the digital version of the book may even be translated into different languages for greater accessibility. “It takes a lot of money to take courses beyond what students get in school, and there [are] a lot of young people out there who want to learn more than they have access to,” she said. With open source content from individual teachers, professors and even universities like Stanford, CK-12’s website provides its users with the resources to meet their individual needs and interests by topic. The “C” in CK-12 has an open meaning, standing for content, classroom, connections and customizable all at the same time, according to the CK-12 website. “Instead of having to a buy a huge book, you can go to the CK-12 website and simply select certain topics and curate your own book. Not only will the concepts be there, but so will the accompanying exercises, quizzes, videos, real-world applications and links to other lectures,” said Scott. The digitization of this book is fitting given Scott’s firm belief in technology as a powerful tool in journalism itself. “You can get direct feedback from your readers, and since the newspaper is the voice of its community, the more people are talking, the more you’re fulfilling your obligation as a newspaper,” Scott said. To reflect this growing emphasis on technology in newspapers, Scott has been working with students in her Journalism elective to incorporate materials on digital journalism in the textbook. Students from last fall’s Journalism elective course have helped Scott accomplish this feat. Gabbi Fisher ’13 wrote a section on “Citizen Journalism,” Eric Ouyang ’13 wrote a section on “Digital Journalism Skills” and Connie Cheng ’13 embedded links to websites, documentaries, images and videos within the online textbook. Scott hopes that these additional links will allow the readers to become more engaged in the text. “When I wrote the book, I wanted it to read like a narrative, a novel you couldn’t stop reading so there are stories and a lot of prose. But that doesn’t translate very well into the computer. The technology elicits a different emotional and intellectual responses and just scrolling through texts is ghastly,” said Scott.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\n“It was a bittersweet feeling, the beginning of something new, this merger, and yet a loss at a change in what we held dear, and uprooting,” wrote Alexandra Polydefkis AA ’73, a member of the final Abbot class, in the final Abbot yearbook. Forty years later, the Coeducation@40 committee was created to help commemorate the merger of Abbot and Phillips Academy in 1973. The group works to highlight long-standing Abbot traditions and start a conversation about the history of the merger and women at Phillips Academy. Chaired by Debbie Murphy, Director of Alumni Affairs, and Tony Rotundo, Instructor in History and Social Sciences and Interim Co-Director of Brace Center, the committee is comprised of students, faculty, administration and alumni. The committee is planning events that will span the whole year to raise awareness of the Andover-Abbot merger. Movie Series The committee plans to screen two or three documentaries per term about gender to continue discussion at Andover about gender issues in the US and around the world. On November 15, the committee will show “Girl Rising,” a film that focuses on the education of girls around the world, followed by a Q&A with Kayce Freed Jennings ’76, the filmmaker. They also plan on screening “The Mask You Live In,” a film that analyzes the effect of gender stereotypes on men and boys around the world. While Lowers and Uppers take the PSAT on October 2nd, Juniors, who are exempt from the test, will watch “Miss Representation,” a documentary that analyzes the pressures put on girls and women in the media, and discuss the larger implications of the film. “For us, the main goal is to spark discussion, because based on discussion comes education, and to really make people aware of gender issues,” said Adéle Bernhard ’14, one of the coordinators of the series. Online History Exhibition Rachel Murree ’14, a Brace Research Fellow, has partnered with Paige Roberts, Archivist and Head of Special Collections, to compile an online historical exhibit about Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy before and after the merger. “[The exhibit] is geared towards students to learn more about the two schools and the schools’ histories. It’s also geared towards alumni, because there are a lot of Abbot alums who feel like they’ve lost their school and who aren’t as pleased with the terms of the merger. This is honoring Abbot’s legacy and their history,” said Murree. The website makes use of the research Murree conducted in the spring of 2013 for her Brace Center Fellowship paper on the merger. The online exhibit will also include various multimedia components, including videos, photographs, course catalogs and letters written during the merger. “The great thing is that you can keep on adding to [the exhibit] because it is online: we can launch it with an initial group of documents, and then we can always build onto that in the future,” said Murree. Murree and Roberts expect to complete the exhibit by spring of 2014. A Documentary Film Charles Stuart ’62, an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker, is in the process of filming “A History of Abbot Academy: Recollections of Alumni,” a documentary on Abbot history narrated by Abbot Alumnae. Stuart conducted video interviews with Abbot alumnae of all ages, including Donna Brace Ogilvie AA ’30, the benefactor of the current Brace Center for Gender Studies. Stuart also filmed Abbot alumnae during last spring’s Reunion Weekend, which the Abbot class of 1973, the last class to graduate from Abbot, attended, said Debbie Murphy, Co-Chair of the Coed@40 committee. The film will be screened for the Phillips Academy community during Spring Term. Abbot Bazaar For many years, the current Spring Carnival was called the Abbot Bazaar, formerly a large arts and crafts fair, auction and maypole. To reunite the Spring Carnival with its roots, the committee is planning to incorporate bits of Abbot tradition to the carnival, most notably moving the carnival to Abbot Campus. Forums in December With the charges of the Coed@40 committee in mind, a forum series has been planned to address questions related to the merger and its repercussions so many years after, said Rotundo. Rotundo emphasized the need for a larger campus discussion about co-education’s impact on current day gender dynamics on campus. The committee is still in the planning stages of the forum series, but it hopes they will begin during the two-week period of Winter Term in December.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nAs part of a new iPad pilot initiative, 28 individual class sections will incorporate iPads into their curriculums during the 2013-2014 school year. \n Last spring, the Dean of Studies Office requested proposals from teachers who wanted to join the iPad pilot. Of the teachers who applied, the Dean of Studies Office chose 21 to use iPads in their classes. Most of these are courses for Juniors, as these tend to be common class\n “We got a lot of proposals and after considering all of them, we decided it would be smarter to focus on the 9th grade because when everyone comes in, there are a lot of common courses. So we figured out which of the 9th grade teachers wanted to use iPads,” said Trish Russell, Dean of Studies. \n Sections of Biology 100, Chinese 100 and 110, History 100, Math 190, Spanish 110 and Russian 100 are the Junior classes that are participating in the iPad pilot. In total, there are 17 Junior class sections adding iPads to this year’s curriculum. \n In addition to the Junior sections, there are 11 upperclassmen sections currently being taught with iPads.\n At the end of this term, Russell plans to reevaluate the pilot in a discussion with department chairs and teachers. “Student input will be really important, but ultimately teachers will be the ones to decide whether or not the iPad pilot will develop into an iPad program,” said Russell.\n Russell continued saying that it is too premature to say whether the school will end up requiring all students to own iPads. “If there are enough teachers who want to use iPads and incorporate them into their classrooms, it may make sense. But I don’t think we know enough yet. Through the course of this year, we will be looking at that,” said Russell.\n However, Russell said that the school will not supply iPads to students beyond the pilot. The school does not supply textbooks for students unless they are on full financial aid. The same policy will be applied to iPads outside of pilot classes. \n Victor Svec, Instructor and Chair of the Russian Department, introduced the first iPad program on campus in the fall of 2011. The voice recorder, video camera, note taking capability, and touchscreen keyboard are just a few of the things that motivated Svec to require his Russian 100 class to buy iPads, according to a previous article in The Phillipian.\n A year later, Svec’s success inspired a small trial period of iPad courses. In the 2012-2013 school year, several Chemistry and Math courses worked with iPads. After the test period was over, Russell said that the faculty arranged a survey of all of the students who participated. “The data was promising, an early sign that we should continue the program [into this year],” said Russell.\n Yasmine Allen, Instructor in Spanish, is using iPads in her two Spanish 110 sections. \n In her classes, Allen is using an eText with complete iPad functionality, so the classes are able to do activities in class and complete homework assignments on the iPad. “For one activity, using the iPads, my students wrote a sentence, recorded the sentence and then shared it with me in an email. Within a matter of seconds, I am able to assess their speaking and listening skills,” said Allen.\n Allen said that her students have also already done presentations on their iPads by sharing pictures of their likes and dislikes and explaining in Spanish. “I am always looking for ways to integrate technology in my classes, and the iPad is an excellent opportunity to do so in many different ways,” said Allen. \n Jennifer Elliott ’94, Abbot Cluster Dean and Instructor in History and Social Sciences, is using iPads in her History 300 class, primarily to access an e-text. The e-text provides resources such as primary sources, electronic quizzes and review skills, according to Elliott.\n Elliott and her students are also in the process of figuring out how to effectively exchange writing through the iPad. “I will be able to offer more direct feedback and will pass writing back so there isn’t such a delay and so it feels more like a collaborative process,” said Elliott. \n Many of Andover’s peer schools are switching to iPads, according to Russell. “But what is different about the way Andover is doing it, is that in a lot of schools, the superintendent, principal, department chair or someone of high standing decides [the school is] doing this. Instead, we opened up the conversation to the whole faculty,” said Russell. \n Russell said that Andover was able to add to the school’s iPad collection through the generosity of an anonymous benefactor. With the addition to the collection, there are enough iPads to cover the pilots in 9th grade classes and the History 300 classes. \n Faculty using the iPad in their class during this school year include Patricia Russell, Keith Robinson, Frank Tipton, Christopher Jones, Nancy Lang, Corbin Lang, Yasmine Allen, Victor Svec, Elaine Crivelli, Jen Elliott, Kevin Cardozo, Paul Cernota, Cheena Hilton, Kassie Archambault, Michael McHugh, Li Cai-Hurteau, Brian Faulk and Lixia Ma. \n Additional technological help with the iPad program was supplied by Michael Blake, David Mallick, Susan Alovisetti and Dominic Veneto, among others.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nThe first dance of this year will be organized by grades, with Juniors in the Underwood Room and the rest of the school in Borden Gym, according to a decision made by Chris Capano, Student Activities Director, in consultation with the Student Activities Board (SAB). “Starting school here as a new ninth grader is a huge change, and we’re trying to make that change less sudden and jarring… We thought we could have a dance where the ninth graders could meet each other and get to know each other as their ninth grade classmates,” said Capano. He added that the different format of the dance was not a direct consequence of Andover’s recent discussion of its “hook-up culture.” “No one ever said, ‘We have to save these kids from the older kids,’ it was like, ‘Let’s give them a chance to do something on a smaller scale,’ ” said Capano. The idea for a separate dance came up at a weekly Deans Meeting, which includes deans, advisors, Academic Skills Center counselors, Graham House counselors, Isham nurses, adult members of Student Activities and other school officials. Capano then informed the Student Activities Board (SAB) of the suggestion before ultimately deciding to change this week’s dance. “I talked about it with the Student Activities Board last night, and no one seemed to think it was a horrible idea, so we thought we’d try it, and see how it goes,” said Capano. Though the board did not vote on the decision to move the dance, Capano said that he took in their “general mood” as input for his decision. The rest of this year’s dances will not be segregated by grade, and Capano hopes to treat this week’s dance as a trial for a new format in future years. Though the first dance of the year has previously taken place on the first weekend of school, it was replaced this year with the Fall Carnival because Capano decided to have a more open and social first event.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nKevin was shy and hesitant three years ago when he met the volunteers at American Sign Language (ASL) Sports during his first baseball clinic at the Beverly School for the Deaf. He had never engaged in any organized sports before, let alone played baseball. Within a few months of joining the program, however, Kevin wrote to ASL Sports informing them that he had joined a baseball league on his own. Since becoming an avid baseball player, he has attended nearly all of ASL Sports’ events. Anthony D’Ambrosio ’14 founded ASL Sports in 2008; ASL sports is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing all children with physical or cognitive impairments the opportunity to engage in a wide range of sports as a fun way to stay active. “While a major part of ASL Sports’s mission is to give kids basic athletic skills, a much more important aspect revolves around empowerment. We want every participant to realize that he or she can play sports, regardless of what he or she has been told before. Realizing that you can catch that ball, score that basket or run the bases affects children in many different ways, and leads them to approach more than just sports with confidence,” said D’Ambrosio. The organization has successfully hosted over 36 basketball, baseball and soccer clinics over the past five years, in which hundreds of children with disabilities have participated. “Catching a baseball for the first time may seem insignificant for some people, but for a lot of the kids we work with, that [act] goes beyond the game of just baseball. It really shows them that they can achieve something if they work for it,” said D’Ambrosio. D’Ambrosio also hopes that the participants will learn values such as teamwork and optimism by interacting with each other and volunteers while engaging in physical activities. “It is socially ingrained in people that it is okay that a lot of these [physically disabled] children are not provided the same opportunities as children without disabilities are,” said D’Ambrosio. “I have close family members who are affected by physical disability, and several of my friends are members of the deaf community… And disenfranchisement stings—especially when it affects the people closest to you,” wrote D’Ambrosio in an e-mail to The Phillipian. Having been raised in a household that values sports and exercise, D’Ambrosio realized the importance of engaging in a team sport. “Participating in athletics is the quintessential way kids first integrate amongst their peers. It serves as a place where children can communicate and interact with the community. But a lot of the kids we work with don’t have that opportunity elsewhere,” he said. ASL Sports has hosted free clinics and events in various New England communities. A typical ASL Sports clinic hosts about 25 to 45 participants with 15 to 20 volunteers and lasts anywhere between two to four hours, according to D’Ambrosio. Trained physical therapists and health professionals are present at all clinics. Working with Partners in Development, Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides medical services in poor communities, ASL has also taken its first step in expanding abroad by hosting eight soccer clinics in Guatemala this past summer. “A lot of the kids we worked with in Guatemala had never been able to participate in anything public before because they are just frowned upon socially. A lot of the parents didn’t want the people to know that their children were born with hearing disabilities or any other disabilities,” said D’Ambrosio. The organization is currently assisting the Beverly School for the Deaf in establishing a Miracle League team in North Shore, MA. It has successfully administered several games over summer, and plans to continue hosting games this fall as well. Miracle League is a baseball league for children with mental and physical disabilities, according to D’Ambrosio. In addition to fostering a friendly and nurturing environment for children with disabilities, the organization hopes that working with the participants will instill a sense of community and civic duty among the volunteers as well. “We are always looking to bring new members aboard the ‘ASL Sports Team.’ Whether a first-time volunteer decides to return to the organization after his or her first clinic or volunteer somewhere else in a community, we have done our job,” D’Ambrosio said. Through both corporate sponsorships and grassroots donations, the organization has raised over $50,000 in the past five years. The fund is primarily used to host sports clinics all across New England, build new facilities and donate to local schools and organizations, according to D’Ambrosio. The board of ASL Sports consists of ten teenagers, including D’Ambrosio, from different public and private schools in Massachusetts, such as Governor’s Academy and Horace Mann School. Fundraising events and basketball clinics usually occur during the winter months, while soccer and baseball clinics take place during the fall, spring and summer, according to D’Ambrosio. Besides the sports clinics, ASL Sports also hosts parties, fundraisers and other events for the deaf community in particular.\n\n', 'Sep 19, 2013'), ('\nThe first dance of this year will be segregated by grade, with ninth graders in the Underwood Room and the rest of the school in Borden Gym, said Chris Capano, Student Activities Director. \n “Starting school here as a new ninth grader is a huge change, and we’re trying to make that change less sudden and jarring…We thought we could have a dance where the ninth graders could meet each other and get to know each other as their ninth grade classmates,” Capano said. \n The idea for a separate dance came up at the weekly Deans’ meeting on Monday morning that included Deans, advisors, Academic Skills Center counselors, Graham House counselors, Isham nurses, adult members of Student Activities, and other school officials. After consulting the Student Activities Board (SAB), Capano decided to change this week’s dance. \n “I talked about it with the Student Activities Board last night [Tuesday], and no one seemed to think it was a horrible idea, so we thought we’d try it, and see how it goes,” Capano said. \n The dance was not directly part of an effort to counter or solve “hook-up culture,” and discussion of the hook-up culture did not come up during the Monday meeting, but “might be a small part of it in the background,” said Capano.\n “No one was ever like, ‘We have to save these kids from the older kids,’ it was like, ‘Let’s give them a chance to do something on a smaller scale,” Capano said.\n\n', 'Sep 18, 2013'), ('\nThe Phillipian sat down with Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, and discussed some of the 86 campus construction projects completed by the Office of Physical Plant (OPP) this summer. The projects range in magnitude from installation of fire sprinklers in dorms to a complete renovation of Bishop Hall. Some noteworthy projects are featured below. Building Access Control Public Safety and OPP together reviewed all the exterior doors of 27 academic and administrative buildings on campus to improve campus building security. OPP felt that prior to the modification, it was difficult to perform a campus lockdown in case of an emergency due to the existence of multiple side entrances to buildings. They identified doors that will now either remain locked at all times or unlocked during the day and locked at night. Doors chosen to be unlocked during the day received a modification so that to lock them, someone inside the building had to simply turn the key that is integrated into the new hardware. Side doors of Sam Phil will be locked at all times and students coming from Morse Hall and George Washington Hall (GW) will have to use either the main entrance or the back door facing the Gelb lawn. The side door of GW that leads into the Day Student Locker area will also remain locked throughout the day. People will be able to exit through these locked doors at all times. A lockdown drill performed during Summer Session proved the new system to be effective. The total cost of the security reinforcement project was a little less than $20,000. Bishop Hall Renovation A several million dollar project, the renovation of Bishop Hall was the largest and most expensive construction that OPP conducted over summer. In the first renovation since the mid-1960s, Bishop Hall received a complete interior refurbishment and now features new walls, flooring and furniture. OPP broke down the wall that had previously separated the South and North sides of the building, and the two separate foyers that extended from the main doors to the common room were merged into one. Changes were also made to the wiring, plumbing and electrical systems. Bancroft will be the next dorm renovation project and will most likely happen within the next several years. Boys Locker Room renovation The Boys Locker Room in Borden Memorial Gym has been completely renovated and now features brand new lockers and benches. The walls were repainted, and better lighting structures were installed. A new ventilation system was also installed to increase airflow and reduce unpleasant odor. The space in the back of the lockeroom, previously left unused by students, was transformed into a large storage area. The total project cost was between $300,000 and $400,000. There is currently no plan to renovate the Girls Locker Room. Smith Center Bathroom Upgrades The previously single-stalled women’s bathroom in the Smith Center now has three stalls and three sinks to accommodate more people, especially during testing and dances. It also features new walls, floors and lights. The men’s bathroom still only has one urinal and one toilet, but the space was repainted and cleaned. The project amounted to approximately $50,000.\n\n', 'Sep 12, 2013'), ('\nHead of School John Palfrey was unanimously elected Chair of the [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/), a charitable foundation dedicated to funding innovation in how information improves democratic institutions.\n“The Knight Foundation is a national foundation that focuses on informing and engaging communities,” said Palfrey. “So the idea is how we can use information in order to strengthen democracy at a local level.”\nSince its start in 1940 by John and Jim Knight, two powerful newspaper owners and publishers, the Knight Foundation has grown to have nearly $2 billion in assets, said Palfrey. Each year, it gives a portion of these funds to support the three tenets of its mission: funding journalistic innovation, engaging and support communities and weaving the arts into the social fabric of these communities, according to the Knight Foundation website.\nBy funding arts and engagement initiatives, the foundation focuses especially on 26 communities in the U.S. called “Knight Communities,” where the Knight brothers originally owned newspapers. The foundation has donated over $150 million to journalistic ventures since 2007, according to its website.\n\nPalfrey will serve a term of up to 12 years on the Knight Foundation’s 17-person board of trustees, overseeing the foundation’s governance and direction.\n> Honored and excited to have chance to serve [@knightfdn](https://twitter.com/knightfdn) as next board chair [http://t.co/lPgWnPXBin](http://t.co/lPgWnPXBin)\n>\n>\n — John Palfrey (@jpalfrey) [September 9, 2013](https://twitter.com/jpalfrey/statuses/377195124557504512)\n“There are many other ways we can support communities directly by giving grants and sharing best practices across nonprofits that’s just incredibly exciting, so I look forward to the Knight foundation continuing to be an innovator in philanthropy, but I don’t feel like I have some particular vision I have to superimpose on it,” said Palfrey.\n“The foundation is on an incredibly good track right now,” Palfrey added, crediting much of the foundation’s success to its incredible staff and Alberto Ibargüen, CEO.\nWhile Palfrey acknowledged the heavier workload he will have to juggle as Head of School and Chair of the Knight Foundation board, he looks forward to embracing a position that, in many ways, is not only very similar to his role at Andover but also to his work for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).\n“I get to interact with I think the best student body in the world and it’s an amazing experience working with this faculty,” said Palfrey. “I think that I see a similarly impressive but different side of people coming through as grantees and as staff of the Knight Foundation, but ultimately working towards the same goal, which is in my view using information—whether it’s in education, or in libraries, or in communities—to have a stronger democracy and help people make better lives for themselves.”\n“The work I’ve done with the DPLA is similar, as it relates to how we support libraries in a digital era and make them central to the fabric of our communities. I think likewise the Knight Foundation does much the same work but with an emphasis on journalism… looking at communities in a digital era and trying to support the kinds of things that make them strong.”\n> [@ibarguen](https://twitter.com/ibarguen) [@knightfdn](https://twitter.com/knightfdn) Couldn’t be more excited for the fun, challenges, and inspiration we have ahead of us in this work!\n>\n>\n — John Palfrey (@jpalfrey) [September 9, 2013](https://twitter.com/jpalfrey/statuses/377196361613316096)\nPalfrey is also the author of “ [Born Digital: Understanding the First Generation of Digital Natives](http://www.borndigitalbook.com/index.php),” as well as four other books on the movement of information in the digital age.\n\n', 'Sep 12, 2013'), ('\nAll voices in the Andover community will be heard as the school begins its new strategic planning endeavor this fall. \n The 2014 Strategic Planning task force, chaired by Bob Campbell ’66, Trustee, and Catherine Carter, Instructor in Classics, will gather suggestions from students, faculty, staff, trustees, parents and alumni throughout Fall and early Winter Terms. The task force will then organize these ideas into themes and goals in an outline, which will be submitted to the Board of Trustees in the spring of 2014 for comment. The finalized plan will be presented to the board in fall 2014 for final approval, said Rachel Skiffer, Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning. \n Students and other members of the community can submit suggestions via e-mail.\n “An Integrator” \n The Strategic Plan will guide how the school’s resources are allocated for the next three to five years. The plan will not only introduce new ideas, but will also integrate existing planning and self-evaluation efforts in various departments and initiatives. \n “This plan will…serve as an integrator for other strategic thinking that happens on campus,” wrote Skiffer in an e-mail to The Phillipian. “Ultimately, any strategic plan is about prioritization, and ours will also be about realistic implementation.”\n For example, the Admission Office, drawing on years of experience working with Andover’s international applicant pool, has spent the summer preparing white papers on certain “critical masses” in the student body, said Jim Ventre, Direction of Admission and Financial Aid. \n These white papers analyzed trends in certain student groups—different grades, races, athletes, international students and day students, for example—and tried to explain how these groups fit into the fabric of the Andover community. The admission officers presented these findings this week to faculty and administrators in the planning process, including Skiffer, Mike Barker, Director of Institutional Research, Trish Russell, Dean of Studies, and Patrick Farrell, Dean of Faculty. \n “It’s a way for us to inform them of our knowledge of where we are in these areas, what we have thought about and where we potentially could be going in these critical areas,” said Ventre. “That effort is to not only provide some professional development for the admission officers who are very knowledgeable in these various critical masses, but also to give some consistency and comprehensive analysis to the composition of the student body.”\n The Athletic Department’s evaluation effort is another example of an ongoing evaluation initiative that could potentially be incorporated into the Strategic Plan, said Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School. \n “The athletic council was tasked by the Senior Administrative Council three years ago, in 2010, to consider the question, ‘What is the place of athletics within the Andover/Phillips Academy experience?’ So they’ve grappled with a number of different issues there that have to do with programming and personnel,” said Jeton. \n The Alumni Council is also undergoing its own strategic planning process, which Skiffer said could potentially inform the greater 2014 Strategic Plan. \n “Their focus, appropriately, is our whole alumni body, around 25,000 living alums. Their work and our work, I’d say it is a parallel process, and so we are working together so that they have a sense of what’s happening in the larger strategic plan so they’re not going in a different direction,” said Skiffer.\n Community Input\n Perhaps the most crucial part of the process is gathering suggestions from the greater Andover community. Through e-mail, in-person and online meetings, surveys and web tools, Skiffer and her team is working to hear from as many parties as possible. \n “We really don’t want to leave any stone unturned,” said Skiffer. “That doesn’t mean that everyone has a vote on what the final plan might be because there are some great ideas that we aren’t able to afford or aren’t mission appropriate. But we just want to make sure we hear from everyone, and if there are themes coming up from the community, we want to make sure we explore those deeply.”\n Barker is brainstorming various methods of collecting and organizing this information through surveys and innovative new web applications for group brainstorming. \n For large-scale research and data-gathering, institutions typically use text analysis programs to catalog and tag survey responses, then pull out key words from those responses, said Barker. While these programs yield “word-clouds” that allow committees to visualize trends in the data, Barker also hopes to find a more substantive ways of processing responses. \n After a group brainstorming session with the faculty last week, for example, Barker incorporated all of their ideas onto Stormboard, a program that essentially functions as a huge, digital whiteboard. \n “You can organize them thematically, and you can start to sift them around, just as you would in the real sense,” said Barker. \n Barker looks to students, in particular, in coming up with new ways to receive input. “If they have particular good ideas about how to engage, how we should engage them, or refreshing interactive ways, I’m all ears. I spend a good amount of my time trying to keep up with that, like what tools are out there.”\n “Watch Words”\n At the brink of the strategic planning process, it remains to be seen where Andover will head. Past strategic plans have often orchestrated dramatic policy shifts, including the institution of need-blind financial aid as a result of the 2004 plan and the significant improvement of student residential life after the 1993 plan, said Jeton. \n This time around, “‘Innovation’ is a big watch word,” Jeton said, noting that one of the considerations when the Board of Trustees appointed Head of School John Palfrey was his track record in innovation. \n “The big emphasis right now is innovation in teaching. It’s an amazing time, with all the impact of digital tools. Education reform is happening across the world and across the nation,” Jeton continued. \n Wellness may also be a potential theme for the Strategic Plan, especially with the construction of the new Wellness Center on Salem Street in 2014 and the faculty meeting last spring to discuss student exhaustion, according to a March 7 article in The Phillipian. \n “People are justifiably focused on keeping people healthy, and having them live a balanced life, caring for each other, caring for ourselves, being responsible for one’s actions. And so you’re going to start seeing threads of that coming through the strategic planning process,” said Jeton.\n\n', 'Sep 12, 2013'), ('\nStanding at a historic 13 percent, Andover’s acceptance rate continued its downward plunge with the 236th admitted class, securing the Academy’s place among the most selective private secondary schools in the nation.\nFor the first time, the Admission Office is now actively seeking to halt what has been a continual decrease in its acceptance rate by controlling the size and quality of its applicant pool.\n“We’re concerned that if that admit rate continues to drop, students who otherwise might like to take the chance would look at that statistic and say, ‘I don’t believe I would qualify. I’m probably not going to get in,’” said Jim Ventre, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid.\n“At this stage, at this level, for the recruitment we’re doing for students to come to Andover, typically 8th graders or 9th graders, what we’re trying to do is hold the admit rate about the same,” Ventre continued.\nThis shift in outlook is intended to attract students from “non-traditional” backgrounds. A “non-traditional” student is one who has no connection to or experience with Andover, said Ventre. He also stressed that these are not exclusively students from minority racial or socioeconomic backgrounds, but simply those who have no prior knowledge of boarding schools and thus may not understand the kinds of students Andover accepts.\n“As they review our materials and they see that Exeter has a 20 percent admit rate, and Andover has a 13 percent admit rate, their sophistication about who we are [as a school] is not clearly defined yet for them,” said Ventre.\nKnowing little about Andover’s holistic evaluation process, even qualified newcomers may turn away from a school that they deem “too selective” based on the acceptance rate alone, Ventre said.\n“They’re not able to describe our contextual approach to admissions that might actually make them a perfect candidate for Andover,” said Ventre. “The idea is that we have to be mindful of the sensitivity of those newcomers to our admit rate.”\nThis new admission goal was made public this past June by Head of School John Palfrey during his State of the Academy Address during Alumni Reunion Weekend.\n“I’m a little less concerned about the numbers than I am about the quality,” said Palfrey. “So I might shift the focus away from the quantitative side to the qualitative side.”\n\xa0\nE.Avvakumova/The Phillipian\n“I would try to focus more on getting the kids who we think will be a great fit to apply, rather than trying to get the greatest number of kids to apply.

When the Andover Admission Team makes its annual school visits, it will no longer give information sessions to an entire class of 30 to 60 students, but instead might meet with a select group of five to ten students, pre-picked by guidance counselors at the school.\nCourtesy of Meadowbrook School \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\nAndover will, however, continue to hold general information sessions in the evenings open to the public, in order to avoid excluding the “diamond in the rough,” said Ventre.\nThe Admission Office relies on “people who understand that there are certain characteristics in students that are more right for Andover [and] that fit more with our culture,” said Ventre.\nIn order to help these counselors gain a clearer understanding of students who are “fit” for Andover, the Admission Office is in constant dialogue with middle and high school counselors, said Laurie Geromini, Director of Placement at Meadowbrook School of Weston, a K-8 school in Massachusetts that sends a few students to Andover almost every year.\nThe Admission Office shares subjective variables with counselors so that they are better equipped to pre-screen their school’s prospective applicants. “For example, they say, ‘Well, we’re looking for kids that have a positive self concept, that have leadership experience, that have a realistic self appraisal, that they have long term goals.’ They make it clear they are looking for kids that can handle a large school, that they can go in as a ninth grader and navigate a school like PA without a tremendous amount of support right away,” said Geromini. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\nIn some cases, these conversations are more specific.\n“I catch up with Mrs. [Jill] Thompson, [Associate Dean of Admission,] and Mr. Ventre every year and they might say, ‘We’re looking for kids that are really excited about robotics this year.’ They don’t usually say things as specific as that, but they might mention, ‘Here’s where PA is right now and we really want students who understand who we are,’” said Geromini.\n“I spend a lot of time on [my top students] and I try to do a pre-screen before I go ahead and give them the green light to make an inquiry to PA,” said Geromini.\n**Expanding the Network**\nIn addition to trying\xa0to pre-screen potential applicants, the office has significantly increased the number of Alumni Admission Representatives ![](http://www.andover.edu/Admission/PublishingImages/Bill_Leahy.jpg )(AARs) and “kid-people” working to broaden Andover’s reach without needing to add extra traveling staff. The Andover Admissions network now includes 1,600 individuals working to build relationships with potential applicants.\nIn an effort headed by Bill Leahy, Director of Admission, Andover’s AAR network has increased by 120 percent since 2007. Through targeted recruiting of alumni who graduated five to ten years ago, the AAR network has increased to 720 alumni in 45 states and 41 countries who now conduct about 900 interviews a year, approximately 25 percent of all interviews, said Leahy.\xa0\nCourtesy of andover.edu\n“The alumni can help those families figure it out if Andover could be a fit,” said Leahy. “Yes, we get more applications than any other secondary school, but Mr. Ventre is really focused on getting quality applications. We want applications from kids that are competitive, and truly think Andover is a good fit. We don’t need to say no to more people. We say no to enough people as it is.”\nIn addition, Andover has nearly tripled its network of “kid-people,” teachers and placement counselors who are familiar with Andover and its admission process, in the past four years. These individuals help introduce potential students to Andover. There are now 900 such teachers and counselors associated with Andover, said Ventre.\n“Lots of families do not have the resources to come to campus, and we want to make sure that they have the same opportunity to enter into the process of getting to know Andover as the kids who have the financial resources to tour,” said Leahy.\n\n', 'Sep 12, 2013'), ('\nThe Andover community will participate in a remodeled Non Sibi Day on Friday, April 25 and Saturday, April 26, 2014, according to an e-mail sent this Wednesday by Head of School John Palfrey and Monique Cueto-Potts, Director of Community Service. \n Students will be able to choose one of the days to participate, and classes and athletic practices will be canceled on Friday, according to the e-mail. The day will consist of seminars with speakers or panels, documentary viewings or on- and off-campus activities with Andover’s community partners.\n “It is a huge commitment from the institution to cancel a day of classes and show that Non Sibi Day is just as important [as a] learning day. Non Sibi Day is a learning day, just like a day of classes would be, just not in a traditional classroom environment,” said Cueto-Potts. \n As opposed to the previous model of students selecting any project they want, they will instead have to pick an activity that falls under their grade’s theme, according to Cueto-Potts. Juniors will focus on education and youth services, Lowers on the environment, Uppers on hunger and Seniors on homelessness. \n “One of the goals of Non Sibi Day was to connect the work we do on Non Sibi Day to the ongoing work that the Community Service Office as well as all the Andover volunteers do on a daily basis. These four social issues are ones that run through most of our programming,” said Cueto-Potts. \n She continued, “What we want to do, for example, is introduce a ninth grader to a program such as the Lawrence Boys and Girls club on Non Sibi Day, so that the following fall, if he liked his one day, he might sign up for the program.”\n The April 30, 2014 All-School Meeting will be dedicated to a community-wide reflection about the Non Sibi events and what Non Sibi means to the Andover community, according to Palfrey’s e-mail.\n “Trying to reflect after a project day is really hard because people are tired, hungry or rushing off to something else, so one of our main goals was to create another time where we as a community can reflect on what we did and how we can learn from it,” said Cueto-Potts. \n Because last year’s Non Sibi Day coincided with Columbus Day Weekend, several of Andover’s partners were closed. As there was not enough space for 1,200 people to participate, only new students were required to participate, [according to a previous article in _The Phillipian_](http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2012/09/13/non-sibi-day-2012-required-only-new-students). \n Cueto-Potts said, “We were waiting for the right time to really re-model the Non Sibi Day Program, and the time presented itself last year after a few large transitions. With some new leadership in the office that was going to be a little bit more permanent, as well as a greater desire to make Non Sibi Day something that was an improvement on what we had been doing, this past year seemed like the right year to try out a new model.”\n A Non Sibi Day Steering Committee was assembled last fall, according to Cueto-Potts. The committee came up with several different models of what Non Sibi Day could look like, and then they presented the models to other committees of adults on campus as well as a committee of 15 students, most of whom were from the Class of 2013. The model that will be taking place this spring was the favorite, according to Cueto-Potts.\n The Committee was made up of Eugene Hughes, Instructor and Chair in French, Tracy Ainsworth, Instructor in History, Raj Mundra, Pine Knoll Cluster Dean and Instructor in Biology, Gail Ralston, Office Manager of the Chaplaincy Office, Linda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, Carlos Hoyt, Associate Dean of Students, Elisabeth Tully, Director of the Oliver W.

During Allen’s tenure at the Addison, the museum underwent a $22 million renovation, raised a total of $40 million, had 30 exhibition cycles and increased its collection by more than 33 percent. \n “I’m very proud of what I’ve been able to do here, and I’ve certainly been helped by a wonderful staff and very devoted, enthusiastic donors. But the Historical Society is a great next step for me. It’s in New York, it’s a distinguished institution like the Addison is and the collection is wonderful,” said Allen.\n The New York Historical Society has both a museum and library division. Allen will direct the Museum Division, which currently holds more than one million pieces and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. \n In 2008, under Allen’s direction, the museum underwent its largest renovation in over 75 years with the addition of the Museum Learning Center (MLC) and a larger storage facility within the museum. The expansion also moved museum administration offices out of the current main gallery area, creating space for more exhibits. \n The Addison’s role in the Andover and greater Boston community has increased due to the MLC and its accessibility for students and classes from all over the country, according to Rebecca Hayes, Addison Gallery Curator of Education. \n “Brian [Allen] really shepherded us through the expansion project, when we broke ground to build the Museum Learning Center, as well as the state-of-the-art storage that we now have downstairs, which for the first time allowed us to house 100 percent of our collection on-site. Prior, it had all been stored in Boston, which really left a gap in teaching opportunities for us.” said Hayes.\n “[The renovation] has dramatically changed our education department’s and the museum’s ability to serve Phillips Academy classes on an ongoing basis just the way we envisioned it would happened,” said Susan Faxon, Associate Director and Curator of the Addison.\n The Addison’s collection now includes more than 17,000 pieces, almost 40 times its original collection of 435 pieces in 1931. Under Allen, the museum acquired more art from the 21st century in addition to more historical pieces, including Andover founder Samuel Phillips’s tea kettle, according to Sidney Knafel, Chairman of the Addison Board of Governors. \n “[Allen] has been assiduous in locating, identifying items that we could obtain, and has been able to demonstrate to people, convince people of the value of making those items available to a larger audience by a donation to the Addison Gallery,” Knafel said. \n Andover has hired Linda Sweet of the Management Consultant for the Arts to conduct the search for a new Addison Director, with the assistance of the Search Advisory Committee, a 12 member committee of Addison staff and Andover alumni, faculty and trustees.\n Next weekend, Sweet will meet with the committee and other faculty to discuss the search process, according to David Fox, Instructor in Art History and English and member of the Search Advisory Committee.

In that way, it was a very laborious first few years, just trying to figure out the world I was attempting to create,” said Yoon.\n “Snow Hunters,” published by Simon and Schuster, is Yoon’s second published work after “Once the Shore,” a collection of short stories printed in 2009.\n While researching “Once the Shore,” which takes place on a South Korean island over the course of five decades, Yoon stumbled across something that shocked and inspired him. According to Yoon, after the Korean War a group of North Korean Prisoners of War who had been in captivity in South Korea were released to return home and repatriate. The group declined the offer and instead accepted a proposal made by the United Nations to relocate to South America.\n “It was so bizarre to me that this group of people decided to go to the polar opposite side of the world and start a new life. That’s basically how I started [“Snow Hunters”]. It was all based on this fact. The more I tried to research it, the less I could find about it, so I decided to just imagine it,” said Yoon.\n “Snow Hunters” tells the story of an individual named Yohan who decides to immigrate to Brazil after being released from South Korea. The book starts with Yohan’s arrival in Brazil and recounts a decade of his life in his adopted country.\n Yoon said the primary literary themes of “Snow Hunters” are loss, trauma, displacement and recovery, themes that also manifested themselves in “Once the Shore.” Yoon noted that he has always been interested in trauma experienced by outsider or underdog characters.\n Yoon said he has always felt a connection to Korea, which plays a large part in both of Yoon’s published works. His parents emigrated from Korea in the 1970s and most of his extended family still lives there. “I have sort of an odd relationship with Korea. My origins are there, but I feel very distant from it at the same time,” said Yoon.\n Aside from reading a general history book, Yoon was mostly unsuccessful when trying to research Brazil during the 1950s. Instead, Yoon looked at photographs to get the flavor of the country during the mid-20th century. According to Yoon, examining the architecture of buildings, color palettes and other visual aspects helped him accurately depict the Brazilian culture for his novel. \n Yoon said that he did not intend to write “Snow Hunters” for a specific audience or type of reader. Instead, he writes as a response to books that he loved reading. “I read books and really fall in love with them. I just want to write back to them and respond to them in some way,” said Yoon.\n Yoon hopes that the primary thing that readers take away from his novel is enjoyment. He said that the wonderful thing about writing fiction is that each individual has a different take on an author’s work.\n> The characters in Paul Yoon’s novel SNOW HUNTERS “find others, even beloved ones, essentially mysterious.” [http://t.co/CzcS76TErQ](http://t.co/CzcS76TErQ)\n>\n> — New York Times Books (@nytimesbooks) [August 20, 2013](https://twitter.com/nytimesbooks/statuses/369832461473439744)\n At Andover, Yoon teaches two Senior electives, one on poetry writing and one on creative writing. Yoon hopes to incorporate his background as an author in the classroom. “I think that essentially what I do as an author is a craft,” said Yoon. \n “For creative writing, it’s more like nuts and bolts, like a studio art. Creative writing is like a potter who has a huge hunk of clay and throws it down and spins the wheel and makes a pot. For me, I see writing in the same way: it’s a physical labor. In my classrooms, we will be learning nuts and bolts about structure, almost as if we have a hammer and nails. That’s how I think of writing, so that’s what I’m going to be bringing to my classes. It’s that crafty stuff, the crafty aspect. I take writing workshop as a literal term,” he continued.\n During his time at Andover, Yoon hopes to engage in future literary projects. Yoon said that he is currently dabbling in a few things, but taking his time to start something new. “For me, if you are actively looking for something to write about it never works that way. It kind of hits you when you least expect it.”\n Yoon grew up in New York and attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Wesleyan University, graduating in 1998 and 2002, respectively. At Wesleyan, Yoon majored in English.\n\n', 'Sep 10, 2013'), ('\nOn the threshold of a new strategic planning process, Andover’s Board of Trustees welcomed Betsy Biern ’84 as its newest member on July 1.

She served as an Agent for the Class of ’84, an Alumni Admissions Representative and a reunion chair. Biern also visits Andover regularly and stays in touch with her classmates.\n “Early on I learned that it was the generosity of past alumni that contributed to my education at Andover,” said Biern. “Whether through gifts to the endowment that covered part of our tuition, to the wonderful gifts of the chapel or the Addison or the Peabody, we all benefited and continue to [do so].”\n “Our motto isn’t for naught,” Biern continued. “Non sibi ought to include thinking about our school and what we owe it.”\n> Betsy Biern joins [@PhillipsAcademy](https://twitter.com/phillipsacademy) Board of Trustees [http://t.co/6tP6ncRxhf](http://t.co/6tP6ncRxhf)\n>\n> — John Palfrey (@jpalfrey) [July 17, 2013](https://twitter.com/jpalfrey/statuses/357574772672045058)\n Biern looks back fondly on her days as a student at Andover.

Ainsworth has taught at Andover for 11 years and currently teaches a Senior elective titled “American Popular Culture,” which focuses partially on the shift of gender roles in American society. She has also worked extensively with students in recent campus discussion on gender, according to Moore. In his 32nd year teaching at Andover, Rotundo has previously served as the Director of the Brace Center. He has written two books on gender history, one examining the intersection of gender and politics and another on the evolution of manhood. He currently teaches a Senior elective on “Gender Studies in Gender Relations.” \n “Dr. Moore, Dr. [Kathleen] Dalton, [Instructor in History] and I have, in one configuration or another, headed the Brace center ever since it was started in 1996. It’s time for new leadership, because there’s a whole younger generation of faculty that are very knowledgeable about gender, deeply concerned about it, and who are already working with it in a variety of ways with lots of different groups of students on the issue,” said Rotundo. \n “[Rotundo] brings institutional memory and a sense of how gender conversations on campus have changed over time, so he is a great anchor for the Brace Center. I’m thrilled to have the chance to work with him in this capacity; he combines really smart, incisive thinking about these issues with genuine warmth and compassion,” wrote Ainsworth in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n Ainsworth also hopes that the Brace Center will extend its role on campus as Andover celebrates its 40th year of coeducation.

Lasting change comes from faculty involvement, and we hope that our presentation will encourage more faculty to address the issues of gender that still exist at Andover.”\n Engel said, “I hope the faculty will take away a sense of responsibility and also empowerment to address these issues. Faculty should realize that they have a direct influence on student life, and this influence can be used for the good by incorporating discussions of race, class, gender and sexuality into the curriculum.”\n The presenters began the evening with an experiences section, which consisted of the anonymous testimonials submitted by students relating to experiences in settings ranging from the classroom to the hookup culture, according to Fisher. \n These experiences had been posted anonymously to the Feminism is Equality blog, or one of the feminism Facebook pages by students to showcase the different points of views on the feminism movement and gender roles on campus, said Qu. \n The second part of the presentation, according to Fisher, focused on groups on campus such as Women’s Forum (WOFO), The Girls Leadership Project (GLP) and Feminism is Equality and efforts these groups have made to address gender disparities in the Andover community. \n In the third portion of the presentation, Fisher said that students offered a “wish list,” or suggestions to faculty in order to continue the shift toward gender equality at Andover. \n Qu said that the suggestion portion of the presentation addressed what teachers can do to both notice and address gender issues not only in classrooms, but also in the larger context of Andover as a community, such as how sex education is provided on campus. \n Ng said, “[Room visiting] talks are successful in terms of providing logistical information, but are not effective in talking about the ways in which a relationship can affect a student’s life at Andover.”\n “There are many things that are not being noticed, especially about the hookup culture, nuances in classrooms and leadership positions,” she continued. \n David Fox, Instructor in English, said, “I think that it was hard for any member of faculty to not be provoked.

Kwon and Sohng focused on the origins of sexual violence in the Native American population and the efficacy of the recently updated Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a federal law passed in 1994 which provides funding for the investigation and prosecution of violence towards women. “Between 85 and 95 percent of violent crimes committed against Native American women are committed by non-Indians, and over half of the reported perpetrators of these crimes were white,” said Kwon. As Native American reservations operate under a tribal court system, where state laws do not apply, most crimes against native women go unprosecuted, Sohng said. The revised version of VAWA, which was passed through Congress this February, will expand the jurisdiction of tribal courts to non-natives and provide $659 billion per year in funding for investigation and prosecution of sex crimes in Native American communities, Kwon said. While violence against women is prevalent in Native American societies today, it was previously highly stigmatized within tribes. “In a lot of the traditional communities, especially the Midwestern ones, if a man beat his partner, the entire community would beat him with sticks and banish him for life,” said Sohng. This stigma is no longer applicable since the majority of perpetrators of abuse are not Native Americans and come from outside the community. The origins of violence within Native American communities date to the emergence of boarding schools in the 1860s. “The boarding schools… destroyed traditional family structures, especially with abusive boarding school owners, who would physically and sexually abuse children,” said Sohng . The federal government, through the Indian Health Service, also forced the sterilization of over 25 percent of Native American women in 1970, lowering the self-esteem and perceived impowrtance of Native American women, according to Sohng. The federal establishment of tribal leadership within reservations and tribes also forced European gender norms on the Native American population, pushing women out of the tribal political process in which they originally held much control, Sohng continued. “Originally, Native American women had autonomy in relationships, sexual freedom and the right to divorce, but those were effectively destroyed when they married Euro-American men,” said Sohng.

Although the program almost reached completion in 2007, the financial crisis prevented the school from establishing any new projects. \n Christopher Odden, Instructor in Mathematics, has been chosen to become the first Distance Learning Scholar. Alongside teaching on campus, Odden will be creating materials for the online calculus course next year.\n Many public schools in poorer areas do not offer AP BC Calculus courses because of a lack of funding, qualified teachers or interested students, according to Farrell.\n “In an ideal world, this program would mean that any young person in the world will be able to study BC Calculus without the impediments that are in the way currently,” said Farrell.\n “We hope to equalize the opportunity for everyone to study high level mathematics in high school regardless of his or her situation,” he continued.\n The online curriculum will be partially implemented next year at Lawrence High School and will hopefully take full effect by the following year. More online materials will be added and revised over the years to develop the online course into a more extensive program.\n Enrolled students will be able to log onto the website, either read or watch a video about a particular concept and complete assessments that supplement the material. The students should also be able to interact with the teacher in one-on-one chat sessions.\n The online materials will most likely be available to everyone, but only the enrolled students will be able to have an interaction with a teacher at Andover, according to Farrell.\n Allan Scheier, Visiting Scholar in Mathematics from Lawrence High School, hopes the Distance Learning Scholar Program will allow students at Lawrence High School to explore more difficult concepts in math.\n “Public schools often have limited resources. If you do not have enough students enrolled in a certain class then it is sometimes hard to justify the use of a teacher and classroom space. This year… only eight students were eligible to take the [AP BC Calculus course],” wrote Scheier in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n “If these students had the opportunity to be enrolled in a distance learning program with Phillips [Academy], they could have taken the class. Distance learning would not replace a teacher, but it has potential for students who are motivated to learn,” Scheier continued.\n The idea for this program originated when Farrell began teaching at MS2 in 2004.\n Established in 1977, MS2 is a free program spanning three summers that accepts economically disadvantaged African American, Latino and Native American high school students from specific communities across the country to help them develop their mathematical and scientific abilities, according to the Andover website.\n Upon the completion of the program, graduates are expected to have mastered the topic of differentiation in calculus.\n According to Farrell, students from the MS2 program were unable to maintain the progress they had made during the summer upon returning to their respective high schools. This was due to the fact that their schools did not offer sufficiently challenging courses, so Farrell decided to create an online curriculum to further challenge these students.\n The Distance Learning Scholar Program is still in its early stages of development, and some specifics of the program are not yet set in stone, according to Farrell.\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nAfter graduating from Barnard College, Amy Richards embarked on an unexpected career as a feminist activist. In her PBS document on the women’s movement in America, “Makers: Women Who Make America,” she encourages people to take action against the injustices women face. \n In light of the discussions happening on campus about gender, leadership and equality, the Andover Film Club and the Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP) invited Richards to Andover on Friday to examine current feminist issues and inspire students to put an end to the social stigma that is associated with the word “feminism.”\n “I think that we perpetuate this assumption that the only way for women to be successful is by being a CEO, Director or other top-notch leadership positions. I think that we should be more imaginative and not limit the only leadership role for women as that,” said Richards.\n “When a female runs and loses, they feel like they failed women. When a man runs and loses, he’s lost. And I think that that is the reason why women don’t want to assume that responsibility. I also think that there are greater barriers when women put themselves in the position,” said Richards.\n Nonetheless, Richards was optimistic about the feminist movement at Andover and nationally, where she viewed the distribution of “FEMINIST” t-shirts last week as a positive stride towards improvement. \n “I see such a profound change due to the efforts of feminism movement supporters. I see so many more women taking on responsibilities, hopes and trying to achieve something more for themselves.

By studying the amount of light an asteroid reflected at different points in its path, Falese was able to approximate the composition of asteroid 9983 Rickfienberg. \n Falese plans to publish a paper about his findings this summer.\n Carrillo-Ostrow’s project hypothesized that humans evolved as long distance runners, which he found to be true based on a data analysis of two 100 mile races run over the same course.\n He analyzed times, consistency and ability to maintain performance in extreme heat, all of which suggested that hunter-gatherer humans could survive using persistence hunting and long distance running. \n “I think it is some really interesting research, and I would love to be able continue working on it down the road. To actually get humans and quadrupedal animals on a treadmill and analyze them would be great, given the resources,” said Carrillo- Ostrow during an interview.\n Vargas hypothesized that Vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory properties could ameliorate the effects of cystic fibrosis, a disease involving lung infection due to glandular overproduction of mucus. Vargas’ in-vitro study on the cell lining of a patient suffering from the disease conclusively supported her hypothesis.\n “Although my research project has not ended yet because I am still gathering information and analyzing data, I am very satisfied about my research this year because I was already interested in the topic before I began, and determining the potential therapeutic effect of Vitamin D in prevention of cystic fibrosis was extremely interesting for me,” said Vargas. \n Bloxham examined the different methods of treatment for brain cancer in his research, emphasizing the significance of functional neural pathways when treating tumors. According to Bloxham, it is crucial to determine the location of functional pathways near the tumor in the brain so that surgeons may insert a small scope to perform tumor resections.\n “I guess the results and data analyzing were the most satisfying part about the research. Using this information, I came up with the conclusion that these functional pathways can actually be blocked… I am definitely willing to pursue this subject even when I graduate this year because cancer research is something that I am passionate about,” said Bloxham. \n Biology 600/610 students worked with Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology and the faculty advisor for the event, to organize the Science Research Expo for this year. Marshall-Walker coordinated presenters and presentations and handled the logistics of the exposition on Sunday.\n “Dr. Marshall-Walker has been an amazing mentor and faculty advisor. She has pushed me to become an independent thinker in the lab, but she has always been there for me when I needed help. I have grown so much as a scientist thanks to her wonderful guidance,” Vargas said during an interview.\n After the success of this year’s program, other New England schools with similar research programs will be invited to attend an Expo next year.\n Andover students who presented their research during the poster session included Duke Butterfield ’13, Max Carrillo- Ostrow ’13, Fatou Diarra ’13, Devin Etcitty ’13, James Falese ’14, John French ’13, Greg Fulcher ’13, Saroj Gourkanti ’13, Anna Harrison ’13, Joshua Kim ’15, Julia Lord ’13, Edward Molé ’13, Kevin Newhall ’13, Krissy Pelley ’13, Pallavi Prakash ’13, Lily Scherlis ’13, Kate Shih ’13, Amanda Simard ’13, Chris Teng ’13 and Anna Zhang ’13.\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nFalse information regarding food and nutrition is rampant on the Internet, said Andover’s resident nutritionist, Aggie Kip. Kip hopes to correct common misinformation with her official nutrition blog, Nutribilia, which launched last week. The blog will educate and inform students, and serve a forum for all nutrition-related topics, ranging from athletic dieting to vegetarian recipes, according to the website. Kip launched Nutribilia with the help of the communication office, specifically Neil Evans, Web Content Editor, who formatted the website and taught Kip to format, post and edit blogs. Kip said, “No matter what you do in life, your body will still need to support you…That is why I wanted the blog to be not only pretty to look at, but also be informative. It would be fun to learn where the students interested lie and what they want to learn about. We eat all of the time, so we might as well love what we eat and feel energized and nutritious at the same time.” Kip said that she categorizes every blog that is posted. Kip and her husband, Nicholas Kip, Instructor in Classics, thought of seven categories, Newscenery, Leanery, Play Keener-ly, Beanery, Greenery, Canteenery and Obscenery that they thought would draw the attention of students. According to Kip, everything she posts will automatically go to Newscenery, similar to a newsfeed. Leanery will include all posts related to weight loss. The most recent blog posted under Leanery, titled “Weight Loss 101”, discussed the basics of weight loss and provided readers with real facts about what to do and how to do it, according to Kip. Play Keener-ly will address topics related to sports nutrition, according to Kip. The most recent post was a blog providing readers with a recipe to Isham Medical Director Amy Patel’s favorite smoothie recipe. Beanery will discuss topics related to vegetarianism. An example of a blog post under Beanery is “How can I be a high-performing athlete and a vegetarian?” in which Kip offers alternatives to meat for athletes. Greenery will address all topics related to eating sustainably. The most recent post, titled, “How to make your plate a greener blue” discussed the ways in which an Andover student can eat nutritiously, while also being environmentally conscious. Canteenery, according to Kip, will address all topics that relate to Paresky Commons and Andover’s food service. The most recent blog posted under Canteenery was a post about what Paresky Commons was like “way back when.” The last category, Obscenery, according to Kip, will include all topics that are absurd, as well as surprising but true facts about nutrition and food. The most recent blog post, titled, “How to Make People Think Foods are Healthier, Greenwash” talks about the tricks that advertisers play on consumers and how to avoid being “greenwashed” by food companies. Kip said that she wanted to make information about eating and nutrition as accessible for students as she could. The idea for the blog stemmed from how technologically savvy Andover students are—the Internet was the best way to reach as many students as possible, according to Kip. Kip hopes to blog every day, though this may not be realistic. There are many polls embedded into the posts to receive feedback from students, according to Kip. Kip said that she wanted the blog to serve as dynamic, interactive feedback from students and the community, a place where students can post whatever they want about food. Kip said, “Whether a student is praising it, criticizing it or suggesting it, both myself and the food managers in [Paresky] Commons all love input.” Kip said that the forum will hopefully not only make the communication between students and the food managers in Paresky Commons easier, but also the food in Paresky Commons better because of greater student input. Kip said, “Students like to gather around meals at Andover, and many students will say, ‘When I am hanging out with my friends in [Paresky] Commons, I don’t pay attention to the food that I am eating.’ I want students to feel energized with what they are eating.” Kip continued, “It is possible to enhance performance with food and training, but you have to know how. Even if you are not an athlete here, in class you still want to optimize your performance. When you are in class, you want to be with it, you don’t want to be half asleep because how can you possibly understand math or physics if you are half asleep?” Aggie Kip’s husband, Nicholas Kip, thought of the name Nutribilia. Nicholas Kip said in an e-mail to The Phillipian, “Mrs. Kip asked me, the teacher of Etymology for help. In Latin, the ‘nutr-‘ root means “nourish,” so that seemed like a natural place to start. I then thought of the Latin adjective, “memorabilia”, which means things to be remembered. If you put those together, you get the word, Nutribilia, which in our eyes means, ‘things able to nourish.’\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nSeamus O’Neil ‘13 asked Claudia Giles ‘13 by releasing a puppy into Giles’ second period German class. “I was confused at first and didn’t know it was for me, but then the puppy miraculously came straight to me,” said Giles. Giles opened the envelope and found a note from O’Neil. O’Neil was also standing outside of the classroom. \n “I was very happy with the way he asked me. It was perfect and I love puppies,” said Giles. Giles said that the puppy-themed invite stemmed from an inside joke between her and O’Neil. The dog involved belonged to Nina Scott, Instructor in English.\n O’Neil was one of many in the class of 2013 who got creative to ask their dates to prom.\n Prom will be held on the evening of Thursday, June 6, following the annual promenade through campus. \n Greg Cameron ‘13 asked Nicole Ng ‘13, both Managing Editors of The Phillipian volume CXXXV, by tweeting from The Phillipian’s Twitter account. Cameron tweeted the prom proposal during Conference Period. “As soon as I pressed the button I walked around Commons and the library with a couple friends, searching for her. We finally saw each other at the front of the library and she said yes,” said Cameron. \n Sahil Bhaiwala ’13 tried to ask Sierra Heneghan ’14 to prom by spelling out “PROM” on the front steps of Paresky Commons in the morning before first period. Unfortunately, students had dismantled the message over the course of first period before she got there. \n “I got the message. I was confused about why Sam Goldberg [’14] came up to me during History class to say, ‘Did you see it?’ but when I got to [Paresky] Commons before second period I figured it out,” said Heneghan.\n Bhaiwala, a member of the Varsity Boys Basketball team, said that Heneghan was one of the team’s managers this winter and that Sierra Mist soda was an inside joke amongst the team.\n Although he was not there to see her reaction, Bhaiwala learned of her decision to accept after first period. “[Sierra] passed me on the walkway of Bulfinch, raised a can of Sierra Mist to me and said yes. It was a beautiful moment,” said Bhaiwala.\n Some students took a performance-based approach to prom-asking. Unlike Bhaiwala, Unwana Abasi ’13 did get to see her prospective date’s reaction and acceptance when she asked Kene Adigwe ’14 through a SLAM routine. As SLAM Co-Captain, Abasi choreographed a routine for the Boy’s Varsity Basketball team to step to, as Adigwe is a member of the team. The boys performed the routine in Lower Right of Paresky Commons during dinner.\n “It took about a week to teach them all but the team was really fun and enthusiastic, so it was worth every second. I was really nervous beforehand, but I’m extremely happy with how it turned out,” said Abasi.\n Arianna Chang ’13 asked Adam Brody ’14 to prom through a DramaLab. Chang, a Producer in the 2012-2013 school year, organized a group of friends to produce and perform a mock DramaLab called a “Prom-a-Lab” for Brody, who will succeed Chang as a Producer. \n “I knew I wanted the proposal to be within theatre and DramaLabs somehow because that’s such a big part of our lives, and just asking him in the DramaLab Programs or during warm-ups seemed too little. So, I thought, ‘Hey what if I asked him via an actual show?’” said Chang.\n Chang said that the play included allusions to inside jokes or experiences that she and Brody shared. Every character in the Prom-a-Lab was a character Brody had played previously in a Drama Lab or Theatre 520 show. The title of the Prom-a-lab was “Atoning for the 25th Memoir of Success, Errors and Edges,” a mash-up of the play titles Brody has been in while at Andover.\n Rolando Bonachea ’13 asked Rachel Wittenberg ’13 to prom with a live performance in front of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, complete with singing, dancing and back up dancers.\n Bonachea serenaded Wittenburg with the song “Hey Juliet” by LMNT.\n He said that he came up with the idea three weeks prior and the group spent time rehearsing the dancing and vocals leading up to the execution.\n “There’s only one person in the world that I’m willing to embarrass myself that much for, so I’m glad that it turned out well,” said Bonachea.\n Others went with the element of surprise. Malachi Price ’13 wrote “Prom?” with window markers on the car of Renée LaMarche ’14. After secretly taking her car keys, Price moved her car to the Paresky circle and asked LaMarche to meet him there. When she arrived, he was standing next to the car with flowers.\n “It took a few days to plan, as I was unsure how I would get the car and have time to do markers and everything. It ended up really well though, and she was really surprised and pleased,” said Price. \n Rejoicing after a victory against Exeter for the Girl’s Softball team, Sven Lerner ’13 asked Abby Chung ’13 to prom when the team was called into a huddle and Coach Drench directed their attention to the outfield, where Lerner and friends held up signs for Chung.\n “Apparently I almost ruined it by having the team walk out towards where he and his friends were hiding to start cleaning up the field, when we were supposed to just wait in the dugout. But it was still really sweet and exciting,” said Chung.\n Jack Katkavitch ’13 surprised Kristen Mendez ’13 with a prom-posal during Mendez’s sixth period math class. In the middle of the class, Katkavitch telephoned Bill Scott, Instructor in Mathematics, who is Mendez’s math teacher and asked to speak to Mendez.\n Kakovitch texted her to tell her to look outside where he and some friends were holding a big flag that read, “Prom?”\n “He had been telling me all term to expect something big, but I was still completely caught off-guard,” said Mendez. “Needless to say I had a hard time focusing on math for the rest of class.”\n Some of the more detail-oriented askings involved multiple steps and many participants. Zach Merchant ’13 asked Stephanie Nekoroski ’14 through a scavenger hunt across campus, leading her to three of the meaningful places in their relationship. The hunt ended at the Phelps Stadium, where JJ Hayward ’13 had set up candles that read, “Steph, Prom?”\n “Even though the candle situation was a little precarious with all the wind, she loved the candles and the whole thing.

The total amount of money decreased from $237,392 awarded last fall, but increased from the $162,697 awarded last spring. According to Natalie Schorr, faculty liaison to the Abbot Academy Association, the total amount granted from the fall and spring remain fairly constant year to year. David Fox, Instructor in English, received a grant for his class “London Colloquium.” Taught by fourteen different teachers, the London Colloquium is a Senior independent project seminar for next Fall Term. The grant will cover travel costs, proportional to the the amount of regular aid received, of the 19 Seniors enrolled in seminar to travel to London, England for five days. “[The course] focuses on a particular period, from about 1640 to 1720, and so actually seeing many of the sites that we’re talking about during the course and having access to other expertise outside of the fourteen teachers involved should help their understanding,” said Fox. Sina Golkari ’15, Isabel Taylor ’15 and Kayla Thompson ’15 received $700 in funding on behalf of the Architecture Club to create a scale model of the Andover main campus for display in the library. The club plans to work on the model during the next Fall and Winter Terms. “We wanted to bring a new architectural perspective, literally, to the Andover campus because people don’t really appreciate the buildings around us, ” said Golkari. “The scale model of the Phillips Academy campus is a challenging collaborative venture for the architecture club. The Abbot Academy Association hopes that the club will also consider doing a model of the Abbot campus,” said Schorr. Alexandra Barr ’15 and Kai Kornegay ’14 are bringing six students to the “Student Diversity Leadership Conference” in Washington, D.C. next December with their $12,000 Abbot Grant. “The conference provides a great opportunity for students to not only learn about diversity and learn about leadership, but also to network with other students,” said Barr. On behalf of the Andover Robotics Club, Claire Carroll ’14 and Tadeas Nemec ’14 received an Abbot Grant of $400 to build a manned hovercraft. The hovercraft will allow students to levitate a few inches off the ground, and will be used by Science Club, Techmasters and Science Club for Girls, a community service program for young girls that are interested in science, according to Carroll. Katherine Tobeason ’14, Elizabeth Rao ’14 and Bridget Higgins ’14 received a $400 grant on behalf of the Wildlife Conservation Club to build a bat house on campus. The house will act as a habitat for bats, bringing environmental awareness to campus while also reducing the mosquito population during the day, as one brown bat can eat more than 1,000 mosquitoes per hour, according to Tobeason. The bat house is the Wildlife Conservation Club’s first major project and will be built in the fall. Eden Livingston ’15 and Emmie Avvakumova ’14, the founders of a new Fashion Photography club, received $700 in funding for makeup and hair materials for models in their club. “Art’s really important because it helps people cultivate their creative mind… so we feel that there are not a lot of opportunities that let students foster creativity,” said Livingston. “Culture, Politics, and Religion” and Hindu Student Union partnered to screen two films about gender and culture through an Abbot Grant and Chapel funds for next year. They plan to screen “A World Before Her,” a film about gender norms within modern and traditional India, and “Pink Smoke Over the Vatican,” a film about the women’s roles in the Catholic Church. They also plan on bringing Nisha Pahuja, director of “A World Before Her,” to campus. “I think, for both the films, they’re both very relevant right now because they both deal with the topic of gender and gender roles. With the Feminism is Equality movement right now, it fits really nicely with the themes on campus,”said Meera Bhan ’14, one of the organizers. The Abbot Academy Association was founded in 1973, after the merger between Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy. A board of eleven Abbot Academy alumni chooses the grants after discussing the applications and listening to oral presentations by each of the applicants. The board considers the value of the project, practicalities and plan of action, scope and effect of the project and financial viability, according to Schorr. “I enjoy the variety and scope of proposals more than any single project. What I particularly like though is to see a particular project fit in with a larger and very worthwhile educational theme. I can give two examples of that. The bat house project in the [Cochran Bird] Sanctuary enhances the theme of how the Sanctuary can contribute to the educational program, particularly in science. Another terrific example is the proposal for a panel to discuss the role of digital communication.

More than 300 books are stolen from the library every year, and over 275 books have already been reported missing this year, according to Celeste Dascoli, Manager of Access Service at the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL). \n Since the OWHL has no way of tracking books as they are stolen, these books are only marked missing when a student tries unsuccessfully to find one in the stack, or when they are returned to the Book Drop at the end of each year. Hundreds of books pour in towards the end of Spring term that have not been marked as checked out in the system, meaning that they were stolen. In addition, OPP finds dozens of stolen library books in student dorms as they clean the buildings in preparation for summer session and alumni events. \n “It is very selfish of the students to take the books from the library because [they] are essentially taking away others’ rights to gain knowledge,” said Jeffrey Marzluft, Associate Director for Instructional Services at the OWHL.\n “I can sense the desperateness of students when a book that they absolutely need is nowhere to be found in the library even when the computer says that the book is supposed to be available,” he continued.\n Despite this, students continue to take books from the library without checking them out. \n “The way I think is that if I’m going to return these books after I’m done with my research paper, it’s same as checking them out. Whether I check them out or take them without going through a librarian, the books won’t be available to other students anyways. Also, I guess for the more advanced classes I take, ten books for three weeks isn’t enough.” said a female Upper. \n Marzluft noticed that the number of stolen books increases in the spring, the same time when many students in History 310 begin working on their term papers.\n Often times, students will take entire collections of books on a particular topic back to his or her dorm to continue researching after the OWHL closes.\n Other students who then need to use those books have to order them from another library in the NOBLE network. These books take days to arrive, and often might simply be unavailable at another library. “What is even worse is that sometimes we are the only library that has a copy of that book,” said Dascoli. \n Dascoli believes students steal library books because they either forget to bring their BlueCards or are blocked out of the library system due to excessive overdue fines.\n As an alternative to stealing books, students occasionally hide books in the stacks where others cannot access them. Although librarians periodically search the stacks for misplaced or hidden books, the sheer size of the OWHL’s collection renders frequent and comprehensive searches impossible.\n There is currently no security system installed in the library to prevent theft, which is why it is likely that there are many more missing books than the approximately 300 books that are returned at the end of each year without having been checked out.\n According to Dascoli, about ten years ago, the library used to mark all books with magnetic tapes and detective bars in front of the main entrance. However, the security system cost over $20,000 a year to maintain and, therefore, was soon abolished.\n Although there have been conversations about the possibility of installing security cameras, nothing is being implemented right now, said Dascoli. \n “I think installing [security cameras] goes against how Phillips Academy functions as a community. The Blue Book states that honesty is the basic value in which this community rests. If we have to install cameras to make sure that nobody is stealing, that isn’t necessarily making honesty a foundation of the community,” said Marzluft.\n Rather than implementing any strict security systems, both Dascoli and Marzluft hope to raise awareness amongst the student body regarding the issue of book theft to alleviate the problem. \n “I think the students take [the books] because they don’t consider it stealing. If they thought what they were doing was unrightfully taking the books, I don’t think they would do it,” said Marzluft. \n He hopes that once students realize the magnitude of the impact their poor behavior has on their peers, they will think twice before taking books out of the library.\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nLast week, over 500 faculty and students wore FEMINIST shirts in a show of support for the Feminism is Equality movement. Lewis Robinson, Writer-in-Residence and one of the seven faculty members who organized the shirts, which were distributed for free, agreed to an interview over e-mail with The Phillipian staff. \n What were the intentions of the organizers of the FEMINIST shirts? What were you all hoping to achieve? “Feminism” and “feminist” are words that have been used on campus this year in a variety of ways. Many times at school I’ve heard people say, “I’m not a feminist, but….” or “those feminists are trying to…” or “there’s nothing wrong.” As faculty members, and as male faculty members, we wanted to inspire broad discussion, to reassert the standard definition of the word “feminist,” and to give others in the community the opportunity to say, “this is what a feminist looks like.” The students in the group “feminism = equality” have been sticking their necks out all year, and we wanted to commend their activism and give others an opportunity to display a simple gesture of support for those students, and for equality in general. \n Do you think it achieved these goals? Yes, and no. We knew it was a small gesture, and imperfect. I think the student leaders in “feminism=equality” felt supported, which is something we in the group wanted. All 500 shirts were “sold out” by the beginning of 4th period. The surprise arrival of the shirts was, for the community, at turns exciting, confusing, gratifying, annoying, unifying, and alienating. I’m sure some people wore the shirts ironically, which was okay with me, too. I think as a kind of “performance art,” the t-shirt surprise was successful. However, I think I didn’t immediately recognize that it would be seen by some as a recapitulation of the very power imbalance we believe should be rectified. We were, after all, a group of males using our power and credibility to assert an opinion. I think we should have probably gotten more faculty involved before unleashing the shirts. \n What is the feminist movement as you understand it on campus? How does it relate to the aim of the shirts? The feminist movement on campus seems to be primarily concerned with raising awareness about cultural and institutional sexism. Sexism is insidious, and sometimes subtle, and to bring it to light in an attempt to rectify it requires a lot of hard work—work in the classroom, work among the students, and among the faculty and administration. The t-shirt gesture, on the other hand, was not particularly subtle, and it was extremely easy to do. \n What are your concerns, if you have any, as a faculty member when making a public statement like this? I would be concerned if people didn’t talk about the issues in a substantive way. \n What are your concerns, if you have any, when talking about feminism in class or using class time to discuss it? I occasionally bring up my personal political convictions in context, not to proselytize, but to be transparent, and to encourage others to be transparent. I think it would be disingenuous of me to do otherwise. It’s like a media source purporting to be wholly objective. It’s impossible.\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\n“Congress is broken, Wall Street is broken and the media is broken,” announced Howard Dean, former six-term Governor of Vermont and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, in his talk to the Andover community last Thursday. \n In order to prompt social change in more innovative ways without relying on the traditional “broken” political system of the United States, Dean said that Millennials opt to create alternative vehicles for change, such as using the Internet to pressure the government, instead of entering politics themselves. On the other hand, he said, his generation would protest against the government to no avail. \n “In my generation, as we grew up, we were a rebellious generation; we wanted to do everything differently. We were going to change the system. But my perception of your generation is that you are simply going to go around the system,” said Dean. \n “Your generation is not ideologically bound to what you work on. You find the 90 percent of stuff that you all agree on, and paper over the 10 percent you don’t in order to make the change you want to see,” continued Dean. “Your generation has more combined intellectual power than any previous generation, and you’re connected across cultural, religious and international boundaries—you really are the first global generation.”\n While legal and policy-based changes, such as non-discrimination acts and affirmative action, are important, they often don’t have the same impact as the work of outside non-profits, according to Dean. \n “40 years after the Civil Rights movement, education in the inner city is no better. It doesn’t do any good to have a lot of legal protections for people who have been discriminated against if they can’t have the same access to a decent education, because they can’t get ahead without a good education in this country,” said Dean. \n On the other hand, Teach for America, which recruits a diverse group of leaders with records of achievement to work to expand educational opportunities for low-income communities, has had more success in fixing the education gap, according to Dean.\n He also cited the Internet protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) as examples of this generation’s ability to circumvent the political system to induce change. \n When Congress attempted to pass the SOPA/PIPA bills, which were intended to expand federal regulation of online posting, millions of Americans voiced their opposition online. The SOPA/PIPA vote was called off after three days of heated online protest, said Dean. \n Dean emphasized the commitment the Millennials have towards creating changes and helping others. “Even if you go to work at Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs has non-profit initiatives like ‘10,000 women’ and ‘10,000 empowered’ because they realize that in order to hire you, the first question you’ll ask is, ‘What are you doing for society?’ Not, ‘How much money will I make?’” Dean said. \n Dean was also the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2005 to 2009. According to Dean, during his time on the DNC he created the “50 State Plan,” a project to campaign in all 50 states regardless of their usual political affiliations. His plan later served as the framework for Barack Obama and the Democratic Party’s landslide victory in the 2008 presidential and congressional elections.\n “My dad worked for Governor Dean for a number of years, and they grew very close.

Vargas’ in-vitro study on the cell lining of a patient suffering from the disease conclusively supported her hypothesis.\n “Although my research project has not ended yet because I am still gathering information and analyzing data, I am very satisfied about my research this year because I was already interested in the topic before I began, and determining the potential therapeutic effect of Vitamin D in prevention of cystic fibrosis was extremely interesting for me,” said Vargas. \n Bloxham examined the different methods of treatment for brain cancer in his research, emphasizing the significance of functional neural pathways when treating tumors. According to Bloxham, it is crucial to determine the location of functional pathways near the tumor in the brain so that surgeons may insert a small scope to perform tumor resections.\n “I guess the results and data analyzing were the most satisfying part about the research. Using this information, I came up with the conclusion that these functional pathways can actually be blocked… I am definitely willing to pursue this subject even when I graduate this year because cancer research is something that I am passionate about,” said Bloxham. \n Biology 600/610 students worked with Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology and the faculty advisor for the event, to organize the Science Research Expo for this year. Marshall-Walker coordinated presenters and presentations and handled the logistics of the exposition on Sunday.\n “Dr. Marshall-Walker has been an amazing mentor and faculty advisor. She has pushed me to become an independent thinker in the lab, but she has always been there for me when I needed help. I have grown so much as a scientist thanks to her wonderful guidance,” Vargas said during an interview.\n After the success of this year’s program, other New England schools with similar research programs will be invited to attend an Expo next year.\n Andover students who presented their research during the poster session included Duke Butterfield ’13, Max Carrillo- Ostrow ’13, Fatou Diarra ’13, Devin Etcitty ’13, James Falese ’14, John French ’13, Greg Fulcher ’13, Saroj Gourkanti ’13, Anna Harrison ’13, Joshua Kim ’15, Julia Lord ’13, Edward Molé ’13, Kevin Newhall ’13, Krissy Pelley ’13, Pallavi Prakash ’13, Lily Scherlis ’13, Kate Shih ’13, Amanda Simard ’13, Chris Teng ’13 and Anna Zhang ’13.\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nFalse information regarding food and nutrition is rampant on the Internet, said Andover’s resident nutritionist, Aggie Kip. Kip hopes to correct common misinformation with her official nutrition blog, Nutribilia, which launched last week. The blog will educate and inform students, and serve a forum for all nutrition-related topics, ranging from athletic dieting to vegetarian recipes, according to the website. Kip launched Nutribilia with the help of the communication office, specifically Neil Evans, Web Content Editor, who formatted the website and taught Kip to format, post and edit blogs. Kip said, “No matter what you do in life, your body will still need to support you…That is why I wanted the blog to be not only pretty to look at, but also be informative. It would be fun to learn where the students interested lie and what they want to learn about. We eat all of the time, so we might as well love what we eat and feel energized and nutritious at the same time.” Kip said that she categorizes every blog that is posted. Kip and her husband, Nicholas Kip, Instructor in Classics, thought of seven categories, Newscenery, Leanery, Play Keener-ly, Beanery, Greenery, Canteenery and Obscenery that they thought would draw the attention of students. According to Kip, everything she posts will automatically go to Newscenery, similar to a newsfeed. Leanery will include all posts related to weight loss. The most recent blog posted under Leanery, titled “Weight Loss 101”, discussed the basics of weight loss and provided readers with real facts about what to do and how to do it, according to Kip. Play Keener-ly will address topics related to sports nutrition, according to Kip. The most recent post was a blog providing readers with a recipe to Isham Medical Director Amy Patel’s favorite smoothie recipe. Beanery will discuss topics related to vegetarianism. An example of a blog post under Beanery is “How can I be a high-performing athlete and a vegetarian?” in which Kip offers alternatives to meat for athletes. Greenery will address all topics related to eating sustainably. The most recent post, titled, “How to make your plate a greener blue” discussed the ways in which an Andover student can eat nutritiously, while also being environmentally conscious. Canteenery, according to Kip, will address all topics that relate to Paresky Commons and Andover’s food service. The most recent blog posted under Canteenery was a post about what Paresky Commons was like “way back when.” The last category, Obscenery, according to Kip, will include all topics that are absurd, as well as surprising but true facts about nutrition and food. The most recent blog post, titled, “How to Make People Think Foods are Healthier, Greenwash” talks about the tricks that advertisers play on consumers and how to avoid being “greenwashed” by food companies. Kip said that she wanted to make information about eating and nutrition as accessible for students as she could. The idea for the blog stemmed from how technologically savvy Andover students are—the Internet was the best way to reach as many students as possible, according to Kip. Kip hopes to blog every day, though this may not be realistic. There are many polls embedded into the posts to receive feedback from students, according to Kip. Kip said that she wanted the blog to serve as dynamic, interactive feedback from students and the community, a place where students can post whatever they want about food. Kip said, “Whether a student is praising it, criticizing it or suggesting it, both myself and the food managers in [Paresky] Commons all love input.” Kip said that the forum will hopefully not only make the communication between students and the food managers in Paresky Commons easier, but also the food in Paresky Commons better because of greater student input. Kip said, “Students like to gather around meals at Andover, and many students will say, ‘When I am hanging out with my friends in [Paresky] Commons, I don’t pay attention to the food that I am eating.’ I want students to feel energized with what they are eating.” Kip continued, “It is possible to enhance performance with food and training, but you have to know how. Even if you are not an athlete here, in class you still want to optimize your performance. When you are in class, you want to be with it, you don’t want to be half asleep because how can you possibly understand math or physics if you are half asleep?” Aggie Kip’s husband, Nicholas Kip, thought of the name Nutribilia. Nicholas Kip said in an e-mail to The Phillipian, “Mrs. Kip asked me, the teacher of Etymology for help. In Latin, the ‘nutr-‘ root means “nourish,” so that seemed like a natural place to start. I then thought of the Latin adjective, “memorabilia”, which means things to be remembered. If you put those together, you get the word, Nutribilia, which in our eyes means, ‘things able to nourish.’\n\n', 'May 23, 2013'), ('\nFaculty voted in favor of proposals revising end-of-term major assignment scheduling and procedures to resolve conflicting major assignments at a faculty meeting on April 29.\n Beginning in the fall of 2013, each class will be limited to two major assignments in the final three weeks of the term including Extended Period Week (EPW) and only one major assignment per week throughout the entire term. In addition, students will now only be expected to take two major assignments per day, but will have to e-mail all three teachers and their house counselor or advisor to have conflicting assignments moved. \n “If you look at the current rules that govern assignments in the final three weeks of the term, including assessment week, it’s really long and complicated and students and teachers are often confused by it. It’s very specific and it restrains assignments in a way that unintentionally makes the problem worse,” said John Rogers, Dean of Studies. \n Rogers said that the change will help distribute assignments for students more evenly during the last three weeks of term. Under the current system, penultimate week and EPW are heavily weighted with major assignments—assessments for Juniors, Lowers and Uppers and term papers and projects for Seniors.\n The second provision of the new proposal dictates that no class may have more than one major assignment due in any given week throughout the duration of the term, including EPW. Rogers defined a major assignment as a test, paper or project that requires two or more nights’ worth of preparation. Rogers said that the goal of this guideline is to ensure that a student has a weekend to prepare for every major assignment.\n The faculty also introduced a new policy to resolve conflicts regarding multiple major assignments on one day. Under the new policy, students are expected to be prepared for up to two major assignments on any given day, instead of the current three. Students with more than two are now required to contact the teacher 24 hours in advance, though late requests may still be honored at the discretion of the teacher. \n Students must also e-mail all three teachers that have given conflicting major assignments and copy his or her counselor or advisor. The e-mail should explain the three conflicting major assignment as well as specify which assignment the student wishes to move. \n Rogers said that this would increase clarity and honesty between students and teachers. “It would take the burden off the student to negotiate with the teachers,” added Rogers.\n Rogers indicated that the e-mail process will also help the faculty keep tabs on how often students are presented with three or more assignments due on the same day.\n “I think this will help the situation where students plan ahead, but just have too many things due on any given day. This system supports students who are planning well,” said Trish Russell, Interim West Quad South Cluster Dean, who will assume the position of Dean of Studies after John Rogers finishes his term this year.\n Faculty agreed that, in terms of rescheduling assignments, non-proctored assignments, such as papers, should be moved in preference to tests and projects in order to lessen the degree of inconvenience.\n The current end-of-term rules were added seven years ago. Rogers said that an update was in order. “I figured it was time to make a policy change instead of constantly making exceptions,” said Rogers.\n After hearing complaints and observing problems, Rogers drafted the proposals and introduced them to the Academic Council, which consists of department and division chairs. The Academic Council, after input from individual departments, presented the finished proposal to the faculty.\n Rogers decided to address the issues now because his Dean of Studies term ends at the conclusion of this school year. “This is my last year as Dean of Studies and there were a bunch of unsolved items that are largely logistical. I thought it would be good to clear the decks for Ms. Russell when she comes in as the next Dean of Studies.”\n\n', 'May 16, 2013'), ('\nThe Board of Trustees gathered for its annual spring meetings two weekends ago to honor members of the Andover community, including Temba and Vuvu Maqubela, who will leave Andover for Groton this summer, and Steven Ho ’74, who is finishing his term as an Alumni Trustee.\n Other prominent events included a review of upcoming campus renovation projects, including the construction of a new Health and Wellness Center to be located on Salem Street, and a discussion of the school’s plan after the conclusion of the Campaign for Andover this past January.\n Five departing administrators and faculty members were honored at a dinner for faculty, alumni and friends of the Academy in the Smith Center, according to an Andover press release.\n Head of School John Palfrey offered personal gratitude for the warm welcome and mentorship the Maqubelas gave him and his family as they immersed themselves in the Andover community. He also read a sample of the dozens of heartfelt reflections sent in by alumni, according to the press release.\n To celebrate retiring faculty members, Palfrey asked individual teachers to speak about their colleague’s contributions. \n Therese Zemlin, Instructor and Chair in Art, spoke about Gail Boyajian, Instructor in Art and Architecture, Chris Gurry ’66, Instructor in History, spoke about Vic Henningsen ’69, Instructor in History, Elizabeth Mayer, Instructor and Chair in Classics, spoke about David Pottle, Instructor in Classics, Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics, spoke about Kathy Pryde, Instructor in Physics, and Peter Merrill, Instructor in Russian and German, spoke about Natalie Schorr ’62, Instructor in French, according to the press release.\n Retiring faculty members, whose combined Andover service and leadership total 139 years, will also be featured in the spring issue of Andover Magazine, according to the press release.\n Prior to the dinner, trustees, faculty and alumni marked the final chapter of The Campaign for Andover by re-dedicating Bulfinch Hall to Jean St. Pierre, Faculty Emeritus in English. The rededication included interactive classroom sessions followed by an outdoor ceremony on Tuesday, according to the press release.\n Members of the Dean of Students Office, the House Counselor Committee and the Community Health Team joined the trustees for discussions focused on residential life at Andover. Peter Currie ’74, President of the Board of Trustees, requested that the board discuss topics such as the 40-year-old cluster system, support for struggling students, the challenges and benefits of a residential program in a diverse community and the balance of work and life for both students and faculty.\n In a similar vein, plans for a new Wellness Center, to be located on Salem Street near Shuman Admission Center, Brenner House and Bulfinch Hall, gained momentum over the weekend. The trustees determined that funds for the $10 million project must be secured by April 2014 in order to begin construction in summer 2014, according to the press release. \n Shepley Bulfinch of Boston will work with trustees and members of the campus community on design specifications over the next several months, according to the press release.\n Trustees also reviewed a number of campus renovations. Larry Muench, Director of Facilities, said that Bishop Hall will undergo a major renovation, its first since 1966. The project will include a new slate roof, new windows and masonry work. Interior improvements will include new electrical and heating systems, a sprinkler system and refurbished dorm rooms and faculty apartments.\n As part of a broader plan to improve campus-building security, a card access system is going to be installed in Borden and Memorial gyms. With completion scheduled for June, the new system will serve as a pilot program during Summer Session, he said.\n Muench also reported on a sustainability effort that would dramatically reduce electrical costs at Harrison Rink. The Academy will finalize an agreement with Nexamp to install a large array of solar panels on the roof of the ice rink. Nexamp would pay for installation and maintenance of the panels, which would generate 35 to 40 percent of the rink’s electricity, according to the press release.\n Peter Ramsey, Secretary of the Academy, updated the board on his office’s post-campaign plan. He said that the endowment and annual giving remain critical components of the Academy’s overall budget projections and that gifts to the Andover Fund continue at a steady pace, though slightly behind last year’s numbers.\n He continued discussing upcoming “mini-campaigns.” These campaigns include fundraising for the Wellness Center, outreach programs and a targeted appeal to partially endow The Phillipian.\n Tracy Sweet, Director of Communications, made a presentation on the evolving communication environment. She engaged trustees in a generative discussion about future messaging and positioning to support the upcoming strategic plan. The framing question: “What do you want the world to know about Andover?” prompted a brainstorm of phrases and descriptors, the first of many future conversations that will also involve faculty, staff, alumni, parents and students, according to the press release. \n Sally Holm, Director of Publications and Editor of “Andover Magazine,” received a round of applause for her four years stewarding all print publications and transforming the magazine. Kristin Bair O’Keeffe, who will succeed Holm as both Director and Editor in July, joined her, according to the press release. \n Sean Logan, Director of College Counseling, led a discussion on the college admission landscape and informed the board of his office’s efforts to educate Andover families much earlier in the process.\n According to the press release, the board approved the Fiscal Year 2014 budget, which will continue to preserve need blind admission and will include boarding tuition of $47, 200 and day tuition of $36,700.\n Steve Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, reported on the academy-wide project to replace Datatel, the current software operating system used by the school. Led by Dominic Veneto, Director of Technology, this process has drawn on the expertise of faculty and staff across administrative and academic departments, Carter said.

Academic scheduling on Saturday morning gave grandparents the opportunity to sit in on their grandchildren’s classes. Grandparents’ Day, in addition to providing grandparents the opportunity to experience a day of their grandchildren’s Andover education, is also an opportunity for the school to raise funds. This year, the Grandparents Society, which organizes Grandparents’ Day fundraising, raised $243,148 for the grandparents’ gift to Andover compared to last year’s $ 79,546, according to Stacy Gillis, Assistant Director of Annual Giving Communications. “[I] particularly appreciate the fact that it is, I gather, just a normal class covering material that would have been discussed even if we were not there. The teachers at Andover are so outstanding; it is a real treat to watch them in action, and the students participate fully so we feel as though we have really had an insider’s view of the school,” said Jean Gould, grandmother of Phoebe Gould ’15. In the case that a student didn’t have class during first period, grandparents were able to take part in various activities across campus, including an archaeological scavenger hunt and a master class at the Addison Gallery of American Art. During the scavenger hunt, hosted by the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology, participants followed 15 clues, where each mystery solved allowed grandparents to learn more about the collections held at the museum, according to the Grandparents’ Day invitation. During second period, Page Roberts, Archivist, shared her plans for the Archives and Special Collections, focusing on student use of the collections and their incorporation into the curriculum. Following the end of classes, the Addison held two master classes for grandparents and grandchildren who had RSVP’d beforehand. The master classes were lead by Brian Allen, Director, and Rebecca Hayes, Addison Curator of Education, and attendees learned about curating and installing an exhibition. They also witnessed how students at Andover used the Addison’s resources. Grandparents were also able to enjoy lunch with their grandchildren in Paresky Commons, though many chose to eat at restaurants in the surrounding area. “Walking around with [my grandparents] was a good way for me to spend time with them, but also to show them the school and tell them a little bit about my life here,” said Lily Grossbard ’15. Following lunch, grandparents and their grandchildren gathered in the Underwood Room for a dessert reception featuring Head of School John Palfrey. The day’s activities concluded with the Student Showcase in Kemper Auditorium, where the academy’s a capella groups, Azure, The Yorkies and Keynotes, performed. Some of the Blue Key Heads also attended the event and performed. Following the student showcase, Palfrey addressed the audience, along with Grandparent Society Chairs Dick Phelps ’46 and Sally Phelps, grandparents of Matthew Jacobs ’14. Junius Williams ’14, School Co-President, spoke on the importance of grandparents in the lives of Andover students. “Grandparents have played a vital role in Andover’s wonderful culture of philanthropy through contributions to the School’s Grandparents’ Society,” said Gillis. This year’s Grandparent’s Day attendance exceeded last year’s by 100 people.

Asplundh-Smith, the most recent female School President, and Maqubela, the School President the year before Asplundh-Smith, offered students their perspective on the role of gender in Andover leadership, specifically in relation to elections and campaigns. “I want people to know that one win is not enough, and that’s something that I realized with time. I assumed that just by being successful in the election, I would be able to affect long-term changes in gender, and what that meant was that I didn’t spend as much time focusing on gender as School President,” Asplundh-Smith said. Maqubela and Asplundh-Smith shared their experiences running for presidents a decade ago. Asplundh-Smith recalled her struggling to balance seriousness and humor, while Maqubela reflected on the relative ease with which he campaigned for presidency, specifically on the “likeability factor.” “Success and likeability are negatively correlated for women; that’s a fact. So when you’re out in a position of speaking out and sharing your opinions, you find yourself trying to respond to people who said, ‘We want a funny School President, and you’re not funny.’ So I put up posters that were funny, and then people said, ‘You’re undermining the seriousness of your campaign,’” Asplundh-Smith said. Maqubela said, “[During my campaign,] I thought about the balance between being funny and smart, the balance between being serious and not serious, because those are characteristics that are relevant for a presidency, but it wasn’t tied to my gender in any way.” Asplundh-Smith and Maqubela also discussed the absence of female candidates in most Student Council elections. “I think it would help as women if we stopped asking ourselves if we’re qualified for this leadership role, and if we’re good enough for this leadership role, and instead just say, ‘I want this leadership role, and I’ll learn by doing it, and I’ll learn by going for it,’” Asplundh-Smith said. She noted, however, the that male candidates suffered a lower “social cost” when they lost. “The social cost for women seemed higher because there were less of us in the field, so that became something that you were known for, you tried and you lost,” she said. After Asplundh-Smith won the 2003 election by only 12 votes, some male students were annoyed. One male student started an online forum called, “Allegra. What do you think?” “As you can imagine, the feedback was mostly negative,” she said. “I don’t think it’s useful to ignore criticism. I think you have to let yourself feel it, but then you have to move on as quickly as possible… As long as we understand that we’re all biased, and if we can come to the table knowing that we are all biased, then we can let go of our defenses and discuss productively,” Asplundh-Smith continued. Asplundh-Smith and Maqubela also offered advice to the Feminism is Equality movement. “The goal here isn’t necessarily to make everyone feel comfortable, nor is it to make everybody feel heard, it’s to make people who don’t have a voice have the confidence to speak up. And that’s a different thing, and that’s a fight; that’s not a ballet,” Maqubela said. MJ Engel ’13 has communicated with Asplundh-Smith since the beginning of the election this year and had corresponded with her about the creation of the Feminism is Equality site and forums. Both Maqubela and Asplundh-Smith were on campus for Alumni Weekend.\n\n', 'May 16, 2013'), ('\nOn Thursday, Kathleen Dalton, Co-Director of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and Instructor in Histor, sat down for an interview with The Phillipian staff. \n What is your background in gender studies or gender on campus?\n When I came here in 1980, I thought that there was more of a need for women’s studies, and I thought it was odd that there were no women on committees, no women department chairs, the student body was 60 percent male, 40 percent female and the faculty was 75 percent male. So I thought a lot of work needed to be done. My Ph.D. is in U.S. History, so I did gender studies more on my own than at Hopkins, but I pursued gender as one of my own interests. \n What is the feminist movement, as you understand it, that is ocurring right now? \n My understanding is that the feminist movement takes several forms on campus. The Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP) has been going on for four years with adults encouraging students to mentor younger students to try out for leadership positions, including elected positions. Feminism is Equality started as a website put together by some of the GLP people to start a discussion about what is feminism. They believe feminism is just the equality of men and women and equal respect and they have had an online dialogue. \n The current status of feminism on campus it that there is an informal men’s faculty group that sponsored the t-shirts. There is a faculty gender coalition, led by Diane Moore, that discusses ways to talk about gender programs and ideas. Of course, we have Women’s Forum (WoFo) that I helped found years ago, which brings men and women, boys and girls together to talk about gender issues. And then there is the Brace center, which was founded to be a forum for research, scholarship, and discussion, and also a safe place for kids to come and talk about gender issues from all viewpoints. \n What does the word “feminist” mean in a historical context? How have different movements used the word and how has Andover used the word? \n Historically, feminists were people who wanted to promote women’s attempts to gain basic rights, such as the right to vote, the right to speak in public, the right to own property after they married, the right to have custody over their children, the right to go to law school, and do very basic things that we all take for granted now. The early feminists at Seneca Falls were asking for what we consider very basic things. People in the 19th century did not agree with them, so they had a very long hard fight. When you look at Elizabeth Katie Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Frederick Douglass and other people at Seneca Falls, who spent their lives struggling with these issues, them getting the vote in 1920 was only a small part of it. \n Feminism in the 20th century, what we call the second wave, came in the 1960’s, when women of my generation asked not only for the right to go to schools like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but also the right to go to law school and medical school. They also asked for equal pay for equal work, the kind of national organization of women basic requests for equal rights and equal treatment. \n Radical feminists asked some really profound and important questions about whether gender is a relationship of dominance and submission where women are subservient class and men are the privileged class. There is a recent article about Shulamith Firestone, which is very sad, but she also wrote books at this time period that said the conversation about gender shouldn’t be just about “Can I go to law school?” It should be about “Why are women doing all of the housework but also the emotional work? Why is gender organized so that men are supposed to have these qualities and women are supposed to have other qualities? Why are you putting us in these boxes because our full humanity isn’t defined by these very limiting gender roles?” Some women really want to be in the army. Some women really want to be plumbers. For some women, they wanted who they are to be defined, at least in the 60’s, as having a male-only job. \n So those two, both the liberal feminists and the radical feminists made huge gains. Title IX is one of them, which is when the federal government said it is time to spend equally on women’s athletics. When I was in high school I was told in a public funded high school that we could not have a girls’ tennis team because even though we had beaten some of the members of the boys team in informal games, girls did not compete. \n If you look at 1965–when I was discouraged from being a lawyer and people said to me women cannot be lawyers–to 1970, when I graduated from college, the conversation changed radically so a lot of women could do a lot more things. \n For me, feminism has been the opening up of questioning of a subservient position of women that so many people take for granted. Feminism is Equality is not just about equal rights. It is also about equal respect and full personhood. \n I do think that you can see in Girls Leadership Program and Feminism is Equality that people want to read about it, study it, think about it, and have conversations about it. I think that there is that very active intellectual questioning that I, as a teacher, I really like to see. \n But I also think that it is perfectly understandable that some kids are not ready to talk about it.\n For years I have been trying to get students to think about the gender atmosphere of the colleges that they are desperate to go to and whether they could select colleges on the basis of female friendly or female empowering environments. I find students resistant to even having that conversation. Where we are on campus is that I think some people are talking about it, and other people don’t want to talk about it yet. \n Do you think that movement that is happening right has helped to dispel some of the stigmas attached to talking about? Do you think more people are willing to talk about it? \n I think they have been very successful at having a lot of good discussions about it. One of the reasons for the male faculty teacher gesture, which I believe many faculty who are part of the gender coalition supported but did not initiate, was a gesture of support for the feminism is equality students who got some backlash and nastiness on the website. The idea was to communicate that those students are not alone and that it is ok for a feminist, you have free speech rights here, and you have a right to discuss this and we will support your right. Not to say that dogmatically I am your teacher I am a feminist you have to be, but to say lets talk and it is safe to be a feminist here. \n Why would students on campus oppose or have reservations to the movement on campus? \n One of the arguments made by a former student on the website, is that this is a place of privilege and you all have tremendous options that most people don’t have and you shouldn’t be talking about this. \n I guess that attempt to silence the young women bothers me a lot, in the sense that an academic institution needs to be open to a lot of different conversations. I think that a lot of kids believe the media portrayals of feminists and they may have parents that have prejudices against feminism. Or they may think that being a feminist automatically means all feminists support X, Y, and Z, or that they are all Pro-Choice, or are all liberal democrats, or are all for Hilary Clinton, which is not true. \n I was in the senate gallery watching the day that the Equal Rights Amendment was passed in the Senate and watched as a liberal democrat walked across the floor and shook hands with Margaret Chase Smith, it was a bipartisan effort. There are lots of republican women who are feminists and I think that people believe things about feminism and they are afraid of it. They are afraid of having conversations that they won’t understand. \n What do you think the concerns are for the faculty when they make a public statement like this (the shirts)? \n The faculty are saying that this is an environment where there are a lot of men who are not afraid to be called feminists and there are a lot of women who are not afraid to be called feminists. The faculty are helping those students who are interested in calling themselves feminists to stand up to the stigma. It is really an attempt to show support for young women, who want to speak out on these issues. Wearing the shirts is not to say what they should say, they should say whatever they want, but it is to say we are behind you when you want to talk about these issues. I think some of them really did feel supported. \n Do you think the t-shirts are alienating people as students say? \n I understand that in a community with a lot of different people, with a lot of different opinions faculty and students are going to see this symbolic gesture as off-putting. This is a very apolitical campus. I have worked at other places where political expression is more tolerated and encouraged and I think that this was a very tame, calm, peaceful political expression. \n How have you or other faculty have been talking about this issue in class? \n Feminism is part of the history we study and people talk about it from a lot of different viewpoints. I always believe that you shouldn’t tell people how they should feel. If people legitimately felt uncomfortable when their teacher wore a t-shirt, I am not telling them that they shouldn’t have felt that way. \n I am just telling them it is very hard to believe that the teachers whom I know were wearing the t-shirts would be intolerant of diversity of opinion. People often get uncomfortable when you talk about sex in class, or sexual orientation or even the politics of families. Those are all pretty complicated topics that a lot of kids are uncomfortable with. I guess our job as teachers is to have an open dialogue. \n Is this feminist movement necessary at Andover? \n I think there has always been a need for a feminism movement on campus. It is a climate in which students say they are more comfortable with male presidents. We have had young women harassed by phone and letters when they ran for president over the years so I would say whether it is a feminist movement or other types of discussions, we have something unusual.\n The school statement of mission says that we support healthy coeducation where we want the best for both boys and girls and we don’t look at them as different leaders. We don’t ask girls to take a back seat. We want to really promote and launch bright talented kids and we want this education to be a foundation for them. \n I don’t know the answer to this because we have been talking about this for a long time. I think that things are much better now for females on campus, but we continue to have some lingering problems. \n Female faculty and male faculty have lost affordable day care, we have lost flexible schedules. There are almost no women department chairs. We were doing better at this in the 80’s. So those are faculty concerns. \n I am hoping that the new Co-Presidents will listen to the fact that part of their constituents are very concerned about a prejudice or limiting view of leadership that is going around the student voter community. I think the student vote issue is a problem for students to solve. \n I think feminism is very important because women make up 51 percent of the population, so why should they be held back to less pay or less recognition? Even the prizes at Commencement have very old-fashioned gender names on them.\n\n', 'May 16, 2013'), ('\nSeveral alumni and trustees led the panel “Voices of a Generation: The View from Andover Hill” last Sunday, commemorating the opening of the Addison Gallery Exhibition, “For All the World to See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights,” by sharing personal experiences about the media’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement. The Addison exhibit is comprised of more than 250 artworks exploring the historical significance played of visual culture in the U.S. Civil Rights struggle. The arrival of televisions, newspapers and magazines spread images of the Civil Rights movement. Other mediums of mass media were also ever-present during the 1950s. The fight against racial segregation was ultimately waged through the media to shift attitudes toward race in America, according to the panel members: Rebecca Sykes, Associate Head of School, and George Bundy Smith ’55, Christopher Auguste ’76 and Gary Lee ’74, all Academy Trustees. Moderated by Chris Jones, Instructor in History and Social Science, the discussion centered on the exhibition, which featured photographs, posters and video clips produced for mass consumption during the Civil Rights era from the 1940s to the 1970s. Smith worked as a judge for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense in Education Fund during the Civil Rights Movement, during which he encountered racial issues. “When I first began working for the NAACP Legal Defense in Education Fund, there weren’t any African-American judges. Today, in the New York State Court, there are three men and four women, one African American, one Latino,” he said during the panel. Sykes shared her personal experience growing up in Shreveport, Louisiana, where racial segregation existed despite the Civil Rights Act in 1964. “During the time, my parents were rather happy than sad that we were moving to Andover because [they] were going to have so many more opportunities as a young black couple and [their] children would have so many more opportunities than we had down in the South,” Sykes said. “The images that resonated the most with me were the ones that featured Amos ‘n’ Andy, a sitcom about a dysfunctional black community. It reminded me of so much,” she continued. In 1977, although segregation had been officially outlawed, it still existed as people continued to live in the same communities. Sykes’ father, a principal of a middle school at the time, was often brutalized and humiliated by sheriffs in the area, said Sykes. Auguste discussed his experience at Andover during the movement and the significance of his involvement with the Af-Lat-Am Community at School. “Race was problematic even during my time at Andover. However, it didn’t hamper us because we supported each other and we all tried to succeed here. As a result, I was a very successful student at Andover, becoming the president of Af-Lat-Am and the president of the PKN Cluster,” said Auguste. He remembered the shocking homogeneity of his Harlem community compared with his origins in Trinidad. “[In Trinidad,] there is a large African, Indian, Australian, Spanish and Chinese population. My knowledge of the Civil Rights movement, before arriving at this country in the 1970s, was limited [to] TV and news reports. I was familiar with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and the most basic impression I had with the Civil Rights movement was segregation. It was interesting to me that I moved from Trinidad to an environment that was completely black,” continued Auguste. Lee commented on the historical significance of the images featured at the Addison exhibition and shared his own memories growing up in Oklahoma and encountering segregation within his community. “The Addison Gallery show consisted of moving and important chapters of history that absorbed me and brought me back a lot of very strong memories from the past at Andover and before I came here,” he said. “In Oklahoma, the school system was segregated and even the neighborhood was segregated. Looking back, I could remember the sensation and excitement my brother and I felt as we watched figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. on television,” Lee added. Lee noted the African-American population at Andover was smaller during his time than it is now. “Everything that I do in my daily life, I learned to do it here. One thing that I learned and struck me hard at Andover was diversity and people’s different experience. The Civil Rights struggle is not just a black-white struggle, but it’s a human struggle. And all humans have some issues that need to be addressed,” he said. Smith appreciated the people from several different decades at the panel and their representation of different views. He said, “The advantage of being here at Andover is that the people in this community entertain all views. I encourage students to express their own opinions in the future.” Similarly, Auguste was impressed by the depth and participation of the panel, “I think that the way the panel was set up—having people from the different decades and areas—really captured the audience well and allowed everyone to be honest and open about their views. I feel that racial segregation has lessened dramatically, but I hope that students understand the need for openness of race, gender, and sexuality in this community. The Addison exhibition is organized by the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture, and University of Maryland Baltimore County in partnership with the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Support for the Addison’s presentation of this exhibition was provided by the David Older Fund.\n\n', 'May 16, 2013'), ('\nThe Brace Center for Gender studies named five Brace Center Student Fellows who will present at the 40th anniversary of the merger of Abbot and Phillips Academies. Isabel Bolo ’14, Graham Johns ’14, Mayze Teitler ’14, Alex Westfall ’15 and Ben Yi ’14 have all been chosen for the 2013-2014 school year. \n Except for Yi, all the Student Fellows are researching an aspect of the arts. Though the choice was not intentional, the Brace Center hopes this will allow for more flexibility outside the original lecture-based format, according to Diane Moore, Director of the Brace Center. \n The Brace Center opened in 1996, and has been accepting Student Fellows since its founding. “As is true every year, the Fellows bring us all fresh perspectives and ideas about the multiple ways that gendered assumptions function in societies,” Moore said.\n The Fellows were announced last Tuesday by the Brace Advisory Board, which consists of Moore, Tony Rotundo, Instructor in History and Social Science, Catherine Tousignant, Instructor in English, Flavia Vidal, Instructor in English, Linda Griffith, Dean of CAMD, John Rogers, Dean of Studies, Frank Tipton, CAMD LGBTQ Advisor, Paul Cernota, Instructor in Chemistry, and Maggie Jackson, Associate Director of Graham House.\n Isabel Bolo ’14:\n “The Role of Women in Conducting”\n Bolo will research the role of women in orchestra conducting and composition, as there is only one female conductor working in the top 20 orchestras in the country, according to Bolo.\n Bolo plans to research by using Phillips Academy as a case study, though she does not currently see a gender disparity within orchestras. “I’m interviewing alumni who have gone into conducting, and I’ll ask them how things changed from Phillips Academy to college and the real world,” Bolo said.\n “I’ve been a musician since I was six years old; it’s a huge part of my life, and I realized that I’ve never been under a female conductor that was the main conductor,” Bolo said. She was further encouraged to apply after seeing the Brace presentation of her proctor, Jing Qu ’13, on women in journalism.\n Graham Johns ’14:\n “U.S. Stigmas Against Male Dancers”\n Johns will focus on the public perception of male ballet dancers, starting in 1800s with the era of romantic ballet and continuing to current day, using Phillips Academy as a case study.\n “I’m researching how stigma affected male dancers at Phillips Academy, and how they were viewed and whether that held true to stereotypes, or it countered it,” Johns said.\n Johns’s idea stems from his experience as a dancer on campus after he witnessed the lack of appreciation for male dancers. \n Johns will research at the New York Public Library and on campus with Stephanie Aude, Instructional Librarian.\n Mayze Teitler ’14:\n “The Portrayal of Negative Gender Stereotypes in Video Games”\n After seeing the depiction of women in her friends’ video games, Teitler decided to research the negative portrayals of women in videogames and their psychological effects on the children who play them.\n “If you’re playing a game that’s targeted towards boys, the female characters are highly sexualized, and unrealistically so. So it’s not good for either the boys or girls to see those roles, because it enforces the stereotypes that we’re trying to break down as a culture,” Teitler said.\n Teitler plans to read scholarly texts about the psychological effects of video games in addition to playing the most popular games herself and analyzing the depiction of characters in a feminist-critical context.\n Alex Westfall ’15:\n “The Rise of Women in Comedy”\n Westfall will research the role that women currently play in comedy, and how they have risen in the realms of both sketch comedy and stand-up comedy.\n Westfall had thought about the theme of women in comedy, previously, but decided to apply for Brace Scholar after hearing comments during the gender debate on campus. “I heard people saying, ‘the president has to be funny and girls aren’t funny,’ so I thought that this topic would apply,” Westfall said.\n Westfall plans to go to New York City and interview female comedy writers and actors about their experiences in the business. She will also read books and autobiographies of female comedians.\n Ben Yi ’14:\n “A Post-Merger Study of Gender at Andover”\n Yi will research the merger between Abbot Academy and Phillips Academy, continuing the project started by Rachel Murree ’14 and Annika Neklason ’14, two fellows from this year. His project is the only one that is not part of the larger theme of the arts.\n “I want to continue where those two stopped off, studying the immediate effects of the merger on students and faculty at Phillips Academy and maybe compare the mergers of other schools at the time,” wrote Yi in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n Yi came up with the idea after listening to Murree and Neklason’s project. He was interested after learning about the nature of the merger, which was more of a “takeover” than a merger, he said.\n Yi will review the Phillips Academy archives and read about the feminist movement of the 1970s.\n\n', 'May 16, 2013'), ('\nWorkshops led by alumni and students about different types of writing and a keynote presentation by Nathan Scott ’05 marked the first annual Frostiana Literary Conference last Sunday. \n Madeleine Lippey ’14 and Jared Newman ’15 founded the conference to foster a community of writers at Andover.

And it sucks, but eventually you get over it, and you learn to read the comments with a sense of humor,” Scott said.\n “Andover has tough times too,” Scott continued. “Who here has pulled an all-nighter this year? That’s too many hands.” He went on to describe the things he had hated about Andover like the stressful nights and the freezing cold. “Andover’s not perfect, but it is great,” he said. \n Scott frequently writes about his experiences at Andover on “Thought Catalog,” but he is best known on campus for his essay, “The Good Old Days,” in which he discusses the false nostalgia many his classmates have for Andover.\n “They remembered the Senior spring version of Andover; I remembered the Upper winter version of Andover,” Scott said.\n “The bad part about writing that article was that a lot of my friends thought that I was saying ‘Andover sucks,’ but that wasn’t what I was saying. I had two friends that didn’t talk to me for a month because they thought I was ‘besmirching the Academy,’” Scott said.\n Scott also co-writes for a movie review blog called “Shouts From the Balcony” with Matthew Brennan ’05, a presenter at Frostiana and a movie critic for “IndieWire.”\n In addition to Scott, various alumni currently working in different fields of writing ran workshops on topics ranging from poetry to Spanish literature to character development in fiction. \n Joseph Kahn ’67, staff writer for “The Boston Globe,” led a workshop on recent innovations and approaches in modern journalism. Kahn shared his journalistic inspiration and the need for perseverance when reporting difficult stories.\n Evan McGarvey ’03 led workshops on both poetry and linguistics, discussing the connections between “thought, language and speech.” At the end, McGarvey even received student requests for him to teach at Andover.\n Grace Tully ’15 conducted a workshop about fantasy writing and participated in a panel called “Writing on the Internet.”\n “We’re trying to cultivate creativity; we want to see personal growth in writing… and I do a lot of internet-based writing, and I would like a chance to validate that,” Tully said.\n Leading a workshop on Spanish literature, Nolan Crawford ’15 spoke about the use of “magical realism” in the work of Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez. \n “I’ve always had an interest in magical realism and the writings of Márquez because he’s so renowned not just in the Spanish language literary world, but the literary world in general,” Crawford said.\n Kevin Ma ’13 and Bresnahan also led a workshop on novel writing and a question and answer session with Matthew Brennan ‘05, a film critic for “IndieWire.”\n In the future, Frostiana hopes to bring students from local schools, such as Andover High or Lawrence High, and other nearby boarding schools to its events, according to Lippey.

They were Head of School John Palfrey, who served as Special Assistant of the Environmental Protection Agency before coming to Andover, Shelly Alpern, Director of Social Research and Advocacy at Clean Yield Asset Management, Jisung Park ’04, Sense and Sustainability Director and Harvard Environmental Economics Fellow, Stephen Carter, Andover’s Chief Financial Officer, Randall Field, Executive Director of the MIT Energy Initiative, and Christopher Jones, Instructor in History. \n All panelists agreed that if Andover were to divest, the direct financial impact on fossil fuel companies would be extremely small, for Andover’s endowment is comparatively tiny and most fossil fuel companies make money from sales, not stock price. \n “Presumably, the main goal of divestment would have something to do with moving the dial on climate change in the longer run. The question is what proximate goals can arise from that. I think we should think about the fact that it might be one or two different effects: one operating through financial capital, and the other operating through the lever of social or cultural capital. I think we should be focusing the criteria of whether or not divestment is successful on the latter,” said Park. \n The panelists said, however, that while divestment may not bring immediate economic results, the movement’s power lies in its ability to attract attention and put pressure on policy makers and the public relations departments of fossil fuel companies. \n Alpern said, “You can talk of divestment, but students can’t lose sight of the fact that it is going to be other policy actions that actually reduce the demand for fossil fuels… It’s not either [public relations] or [economic consequences].”\n “Trying to base the success of the Divestment movement on whether or not Andover does or does not divest from these 16 stocks would be the wrong way of going about it. The criteria should be how many minds did you impose, how many people did you get to care about this issue, how many extra tweets did you post? What kind of social capital did you accumulate in this process, not that you’ve affected the financial capital of these 16 companies,” said Park. \n Carter suggested that rather than divestment, federal action to impose measures such as a significant carbon tax would create a more powerful incentive to stop purchasing fossil fuels such as gasoline and invest in alternative means of fuel.\n Field added nuance to the idea that lawmakers were solely responsible for regulating fossil fuels by arguing that politicians are reflective of American public opinion. The real issue, he asserted, was a lack of citizen motivation to tackle climate change in their daily lives. \n “We have to create a groundswell of demand by the people of the United States and other countries to get carbon policies in place, and to make it clear that we recognize that there is a sacrifice we need to make to make sure our future generations can continue to live on this planet,” said Field.\n “I would like to see each of us make a commitment do something to reduce our carbon footprint. But the question is whether we believe that our commitment to divesting from these [fossil fuel companies] is more important than our commitment to need blind admission and a whole variety of other things,” said Palfrey. He named one of the school’s most pressing concerns about divestment: the potential toll it would take on Andover’s endowment.\n “The endowment supports a lot of things that go on here, and when the donors gave the funds to the school, they gave them for the purpose of supporting education, not to make a social statement,” said Carter. \n Palfrey said that divestment could risk “turning-off” alumni, potentially leading to a loss of donations, which makes up for a substantial percentage of Andover’s endowment.\n Citing slavery as somewhat of a moral equivalent to fossil fuels, however, Jones said, “Slavery provides some very interesting parallels to the energy sector. Slavery in the developing world of the 17th century was the foundation for modern capitalism, in the same way that we refer to the energy business today. On a moral basis, I think we need to ask more complicated and nuanced questions.”\n Alpern also countered by presenting a study her company conducted on the effects of a theoretical portfolio in which it divested from fossil fuel companies, resulting in “a minute impact… on the actual portfolio.”\n Haonan Li ’13, one of the five co-founders of the Divest Andover movement and Former Co-President of Philo said, “The audience should have taken away from this forum that climate change is a serious issue, that divestment can create the social change necessary for the legislative change, that divestment isn’t a simple matter and that divestment might not be the most feasible option.”\n\n', 'May 2, 2013'), ('\nCorporate social responsibility is both ethical and financially beneficial for businesses, argued Nitin Nohria, the Dean of Harvard Business School and keynote speaker of last week’s Business of Social Change conference on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Raj Mundra, founder and head of Niswarth, an Andover service learning program in India, organized the conference around social change last Sunday, featuring student, alumni and instructors as panelists. Nohria focused on the role of business in instrumenting social change in his keynote speech. The public’s general distrust of businesses is concerning but expected, he said, given the recent economic downturn. This public distrust is worrying because businesses play a key role in improving society. Nohria gave an anecdote from his childhood, in which the opening of a factory brought crucial infrastructure, employment and educational and health facilities to a village community. Nohria compared the relative powerlessness of government intervention in preventing poverty. On the other hand, he explained, 75 percent of the world’s wealth is controlled by the top 1000 companies, giving corporations enormous power to potentially combat social inequities. He said, “We will never be able to solve the problem of getting people in the world, for example, educated, by thinking that we will give them free education through governments. We will never be able to feed everybody in the world if we believe that what we are going to do is have governments feed them. It is an unsustainable wrong; it just cannot get done.” Fortunately, Nohria said, many companies are slowly realizing that social responsibility is the linchpin of a successful business. 40 percent of the world’s arable land is unusable, and food prices are predicted to rise in the next decade. Many companies are therefore becoming more conscious of the world’s limited resources, and making efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and their negative effects on the environment, according to Nohria. Nohria also pointed out that business principles are imperative to making non-profit companies sustainable. Akshaya Patra, a non-profit that gives free midday meals to approximately 1.3 million children in schools every day, reduced the cost of a meal to 20 cents as a result of applying core business principles such as high efficiency and waste-reduction. “Business is not just designed to help people who are already rich make more money. It’s actually a set of ideas, it’s a set of principles, that can allow the delivery of goods and services that many other people care about,” he said. After the conference Mundra said, “Mr. Nohria, who is a current parent, was very gracious in coming and spending the entire time with us, and so I thought his messages were really powerful about business… His reflections on innovations and interdisciplinary work and the relevance of what Harvard Business School does to the real world—I think it made all of us think about the relevance of an Andover education.”\n\n', 'May 2, 2013'), ('\n### Community Supports Victims of Boston Marathon: LaMarche and McGovern Raise $3,000\n In four hours, Olivia LaMarche ’16 and Peyton McGovern ’16 ran a combined 26.2 miles last Sunday in honor of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, many of whom will never run again. By collecting pledges and donations in Paresky Commons prior to the run, the girls have raised upwards of $3,000 for One Fund Boston, an organization created by Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Tom Menino to help victims and their families. LaMarche and McGovern started their run from the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, where the bombing occurred on April 15. They then alternated running relay style, each running five miles at a time via Route 128 until they reached the Great Lawn at Andover to meet the students and faculty who came out in their support. “We wanted to raise money, but we thought it would have more meaning if we ran too,” said LaMarche. Both she and McGovern have strong connections to the Boston Marathon. McGovern’s father had run the marathon multiple times and LaMarche’s grandparents live in Boston. In addition to collecting donations, LaMarche and McGovern coordinated the signing of two posters to be placed at the makeshift memorials in Copley Square.\n### Student Band Dedicates Performance to Victims\n Four out of the six members of Finder’s Keepers, an alternative/folk band on campus, spent last Sunday “busking” in Boston Commons to raise money for Boston Marathon victims. Aaron Finder ’13, Henry Kennelly ’13, Seho Young ’15 and Josh Henderson ’15 raised $210 playing a repertoire that ranged from Mumford and Sons, Old Crow Medicine Show, Zac Brown Band and improvised pieces. This was the group’s second time performing together after premiering in Abbot Cabaret this winter. “I am just so proud of those guys and grateful for the enthusiasm and energy we were able to bring to the Public Gardens that day for such a worthy cause,” said Finder. Although the band had planned to play last Sunday before the bombings happened,” Finder said that as soon as they heard the news they immediately decided the proceeds should go towards One Fund Boston. “The fact that the money is going back to the people of Boston made the experience truly special for us. We were playing in Boston, for the benefit of Boston,” said Finder.\n### Town Holds Candlelight Walk\n The town of Andover organized a Candlelight Vigil Walk on Wednesday, May 1, in support of the victims, families and heroes of the Boston Marathon bombings. Following the opening remarks by Ted Teichert was the recognition of the first responders, a blessing and renditions of the Star Spangled Banner and God Bless America. The ceremony concluded with guest speakers, a lighting of the candles and a march led by bagpipes.

Olkowski’s Brace Fellowship Project on Monday, entitled “Pelosi and Clinton: The Effect of Media Bias on Female Politicians,” focused on examining press representation of Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign and Pelosi in the 2010 congressional election. Because the media provides the majority of Americans with the information needed to cast an informed vote, political power is shaped by the voice of mainstream media, said Olkowski. “Media seems to play a role in the perpetuation of gender disparities. Yes, these biases are small, but they could play a substantial role in election results, given the research that shows the harms of such biases and disproportionalities,” said Olkowski. Olkowski argued that gender disparities in the political sphere can be attributed to the national newspapers and cable news that disproportionately rely on men for quotes even about topics solely related to women. Leading political news outlets such as the “New York Times” and “Face the Nation” routinely quote 75 percent more men than women, according to Olkowski. “Media must lead the way in promoting gender equity in the American political sphere. It’s not a question of promoting female candidates; it’s a matter of accepting the legitimacy of women as political contenders and affording women the same coverage that men receive,” said Olkowski. Olkowski believes that the media should adopt a new proactive approach to coverage. He suggested news outlets and journalists actively seek out female voices and opinions in quotes and also begin to consider the psychological effects of their anecdotes and vernacular. “Women view the political sphere as hostile and the media as a still-evolving machine that often leaves women grasping for legitimacy. Women aren’t rendered incapable of running for political office; rather, their attempts are much harder and laden with pitfalls that men do not face,” said Olkowski. As news networks, journalists and radio hosts inform the public, they “frame” a news story, or alter a story through their perspectives, which often differs greatly in the coverage of male and female politicians, according to Olkowski. “A story about Nancy Pelosi may begin with an anecdote about her family or daughters, while a similar story on Mitt Romney may begin with an anecdote about his powerful father or former business experience,” said Olkowski. “These seemingly trivial entrances that lead into the substantial part of articles or news features deeply affect the paradigm through which viewers understand the politician,” he continued. During Hillary Clinton’s bid for Presidency, media critiques distracted the public from her campaign and featured accusations that her accomplishments rested on the shoulders of her husband, according to Olkowski. “In the end, Clinton couldn’t possibly fulfill both stereotypes and appease everyone. She either lost voters for being too feminine or for being too masculine,” he added. Pelosi, who became the first female Speaker of the House in 2007, also faced the media’s biased framing, which diminished her successes by asserting that her familial ties and marriage to a property investor earned her the position, according to Olkowski. Olkowski is one of the six selected Brace Fellow for this year.

They were Head of School John Palfrey, who served as Special Assistant of the Environmental Protection Agency before coming to Andover, Shelly Alpern, Director of Social Research and Advocacy at Clean Yield Asset Management, Jisung Park ’04, Sense and Sustainability Director and Harvard Environmental Economics Fellow, Stephen Carter, Andover’s Chief Financial Officer, Randall Field, Executive Director of the MIT Energy Initiative, and Christopher Jones, Instructor in History. \n All panelists agreed that if Andover were to divest, the direct financial impact on fossil fuel companies would be extremely small, for Andover’s endowment is comparatively tiny and most fossil fuel companies make money from sales, not stock price. \n “Presumably, the main goal of divestment would have something to do with moving the dial on climate change in the longer run. The question is what proximate goals can arise from that. I think we should think about the fact that it might be one or two different effects: one operating through financial capital, and the other operating through the lever of social or cultural capital. I think we should be focusing the criteria of whether or not divestment is successful on the latter,” said Park. \n The panelists said, however, that while divestment may not bring immediate economic results, the movement’s power lies in its ability to attract attention and put pressure on policy makers and the public relations departments of fossil fuel companies. \n Alpern said, “You can talk of divestment, but students can’t lose sight of the fact that it is going to be other policy actions that actually reduce the demand for fossil fuels… It’s not either [public relations] or [economic consequences].”\n “Trying to base the success of the Divestment movement on whether or not Andover does or does not divest from these 16 stocks would be the wrong way of going about it. The criteria should be how many minds did you impose, how many people did you get to care about this issue, how many extra tweets did you post? What kind of social capital did you accumulate in this process, not that you’ve affected the financial capital of these 16 companies,” said Park. \n Carter suggested that rather than divestment, federal action to impose measures such as a significant carbon tax would create a more powerful incentive to stop purchasing fossil fuels such as gasoline and invest in alternative means of fuel.\n Field added nuance to the idea that lawmakers were solely responsible for regulating fossil fuels by arguing that politicians are reflective of American public opinion. The real issue, he asserted, was a lack of citizen motivation to tackle climate change in their daily lives. \n “We have to create a groundswell of demand by the people of the United States and other countries to get carbon policies in place, and to make it clear that we recognize that there is a sacrifice we need to make to make sure our future generations can continue to live on this planet,” said Field.\n “I would like to see each of us make a commitment do something to reduce our carbon footprint. But the question is whether we believe that our commitment to divesting from these [fossil fuel companies] is more important than our commitment to need blind admission and a whole variety of other things,” said Palfrey. He named one of the school’s most pressing concerns about divestment: the potential toll it would take on Andover’s endowment.\n “The endowment supports a lot of things that go on here, and when the donors gave the funds to the school, they gave them for the purpose of supporting education, not to make a social statement,” said Carter. \n Palfrey said that divestment could risk “turning-off” alumni, potentially leading to a loss of donations, which makes up for a substantial percentage of Andover’s endowment.\n Citing slavery as somewhat of a moral equivalent to fossil fuels, however, Jones said, “Slavery provides some very interesting parallels to the energy sector. Slavery in the developing world of the 17th century was the foundation for modern capitalism, in the same way that we refer to the energy business today. On a moral basis, I think we need to ask more complicated and nuanced questions.”\n Alpern also countered by presenting a study her company conducted on the effects of a theoretical portfolio in which it divested from fossil fuel companies, resulting in “a minute impact… on the actual portfolio.”\n Haonan Li ’13, one of the five co-founders of the Divest Andover movement and Former Co-President of Philo said, “The audience should have taken away from this forum that climate change is a serious issue, that divestment can create the social change necessary for the legislative change, that divestment isn’t a simple matter and that divestment might not be the most feasible option.”\n\n', 'May 2, 2013'), ('\nCorporate social responsibility is both ethical and financially beneficial for businesses, argued Nitin Nohria, the Dean of Harvard Business School and keynote speaker of last week’s Business of Social Change conference on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Raj Mundra, founder and head of Niswarth, an Andover service learning program in India, organized the conference around social change last Sunday, featuring student, alumni and instructors as panelists. Nohria focused on the role of business in instrumenting social change in his keynote speech. The public’s general distrust of businesses is concerning but expected, he said, given the recent economic downturn. This public distrust is worrying because businesses play a key role in improving society. Nohria gave an anecdote from his childhood, in which the opening of a factory brought crucial infrastructure, employment and educational and health facilities to a village community. Nohria compared the relative powerlessness of government intervention in preventing poverty. On the other hand, he explained, 75 percent of the world’s wealth is controlled by the top 1000 companies, giving corporations enormous power to potentially combat social inequities. He said, “We will never be able to solve the problem of getting people in the world, for example, educated, by thinking that we will give them free education through governments. We will never be able to feed everybody in the world if we believe that what we are going to do is have governments feed them. It is an unsustainable wrong; it just cannot get done.” Fortunately, Nohria said, many companies are slowly realizing that social responsibility is the linchpin of a successful business. 40 percent of the world’s arable land is unusable, and food prices are predicted to rise in the next decade. Many companies are therefore becoming more conscious of the world’s limited resources, and making efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and their negative effects on the environment, according to Nohria. Nohria also pointed out that business principles are imperative to making non-profit companies sustainable. Akshaya Patra, a non-profit that gives free midday meals to approximately 1.3 million children in schools every day, reduced the cost of a meal to 20 cents as a result of applying core business principles such as high efficiency and waste-reduction. “Business is not just designed to help people who are already rich make more money. It’s actually a set of ideas, it’s a set of principles, that can allow the delivery of goods and services that many other people care about,” he said. After the conference Mundra said, “Mr. Nohria, who is a current parent, was very gracious in coming and spending the entire time with us, and so I thought his messages were really powerful about business… His reflections on innovations and interdisciplinary work and the relevance of what Harvard Business School does to the real world—I think it made all of us think about the relevance of an Andover education.”\n\n', 'May 2, 2013'), ('\n### Community Supports Victims of Boston Marathon: LaMarche and McGovern Raise $3,000\n In four hours, Olivia LaMarche ’16 and Peyton McGovern ’16 ran a combined 26.2 miles last Sunday in honor of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, many of whom will never run again. By collecting pledges and donations in Paresky Commons prior to the run, the girls have raised upwards of $3,000 for One Fund Boston, an organization created by Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Tom Menino to help victims and their families. LaMarche and McGovern started their run from the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, where the bombing occurred on April 15. They then alternated running relay style, each running five miles at a time via Route 128 until they reached the Great Lawn at Andover to meet the students and faculty who came out in their support. “We wanted to raise money, but we thought it would have more meaning if we ran too,” said LaMarche. Both she and McGovern have strong connections to the Boston Marathon. McGovern’s father had run the marathon multiple times and LaMarche’s grandparents live in Boston. In addition to collecting donations, LaMarche and McGovern coordinated the signing of two posters to be placed at the makeshift memorials in Copley Square.\n### Student Band Dedicates Performance to Victims\n Four out of the six members of Finder’s Keepers, an alternative/folk band on campus, spent last Sunday “busking” in Boston Commons to raise money for Boston Marathon victims. Aaron Finder ’13, Henry Kennelly ’13, Seho Young ’15 and Josh Henderson ’15 raised $210 playing a repertoire that ranged from Mumford and Sons, Old Crow Medicine Show, Zac Brown Band and improvised pieces. This was the group’s second time performing together after premiering in Abbot Cabaret this winter. “I am just so proud of those guys and grateful for the enthusiasm and energy we were able to bring to the Public Gardens that day for such a worthy cause,” said Finder. Although the band had planned to play last Sunday before the bombings happened,” Finder said that as soon as they heard the news they immediately decided the proceeds should go towards One Fund Boston. “The fact that the money is going back to the people of Boston made the experience truly special for us. We were playing in Boston, for the benefit of Boston,” said Finder.\n### Town Holds Candlelight Walk\n The town of Andover organized a Candlelight Vigil Walk on Wednesday, May 1, in support of the victims, families and heroes of the Boston Marathon bombings. Following the opening remarks by Ted Teichert was the recognition of the first responders, a blessing and renditions of the Star Spangled Banner and God Bless America. The ceremony concluded with guest speakers, a lighting of the candles and a march led by bagpipes.

I am assuming that Andover will have a lot of intellectual curiosity, lots of questions and lots of data that will have to be gathered to answer those questions. My role will be figuring out ways to aggregate or collect data to support the decision makers at the school,” said Barker. \n Barker’s position as Director of Research is a new one, created by Palfrey in discussions with Jim Ventre, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid. Barker will work closely with Skiffer to analyze Andover’s structure and programming in order to shape the school’s future policy. \n Andover is, for example, conducting a longitudinal study to figure out the benefit of the $70,000 that Andover spends on all students’ education compared to the $15,000 spent at local public schools and $1,500 at many schools in Africa, according to Palfrey.\n “If you look from an institutional perspective, what are we doing for over $70,000, and is it an appropriate use of funds?” said Palfrey.\n “[Barker] is enormously high energy and incredibly friendly. He is very hard working, extremely bright, very personable and someone who has a great background in using data to solve problems,” continued Palfrey. \n “What I am most excited about is speaking and working with students and faculty. That is the biggest draw for me,” Barker said. \n Before the decision was announced about a month ago, Barker was interviewed by several Andover administrators, such as Stephen Carter, Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Jim Ventre, Director of Admissions, Nancy Jeton, Special Assistant to the Head of School, and Rachel Skiffer, Dean for Policy and Strategic Planning.\n Most recently, Barker worked as Director of Financial Planning and Analysis at Harvard University to centralize the services of Harvard’s 72 libraries. He also collaborated briefly with Palfrey at the Harvard Library. \n “We identified 30 or 40 services that all the libraries had in common and tried to centralize those. It is still a work in progress, but for the most part the project is complete,” said Barker.\n\n', 'May 1, 2013'), ('\nKristin O’Keeffe will serve as the Director of Publications and Editor of “Andover Magazine,” effective July 1st, after working as Class Notes Editor and writer for “Andover Magazine” for a little over a year. O’Keeffe will succeed Sally Holm, who will retire from her position at the helm of the magazine after four years.\n As the Director of Publications, O’Keeffe will manage the Communications Office and oversee the magazine’s production. The Communications Office designs all official Andover publications, including “Andover Magazine,” the Course of Study, brochures and campus event posters. \n O’Keeffe plans to bring extensive writing and teaching experience to “Andover Magazine,” Andover’s official alumni quarterly. Each issue features an array of alumni as well as briefings on campus events. Class Notes is the final section in “Andover Magazine” where alumni can share updates on their lives. \n “I have already become so fond of this community. The atmosphere of this place is just engaging; the students, faculty and staff are all so smart, motivated and simply just amazing,” wrote O’Keeffe in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “What appeals to me most about Andover is that it both reaches out into the world and into its own community,” she continued. \n O’Keeffe is especially attached to “Andover Magazine.” \n “I think of it as a connective tissue for all the alumni to keep in touch with the Andover community and to be informed a little more about each other’s life even after graduation,” she said.\n Tracy Sweet, Director of Academy Communications, announced O’Keeffe’s new position on April 23rd in an e-mail to the faculty members. \n “We are so fortunate that Kristin will be able to ‘shadow’ Sally over these next couple months. Sally has brought incredible energy, passion and vision to ‘Andover Magazine’ and all academy publications. Kristin will no doubt continue those traditions and build upon them with her own talents and skills as a gifted writer, teacher and social media enthusiast,” wrote Sweet in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n O’Keeffe previously worked as an English teacher and a novelist before coming to Andover. “I think this job gives me the opportunity to fully bring together and blend [the] two fields, education and writing, that I have been long dedicated to,” she said.\n O’Keeffe is the author of the novel “Thirsty,” which was published in 2009.\n After obtaining her Masters degree in Fine Arts at Columbia College Chicago, O’Keeffe taught writing courses at several high schools and universities including Boston College, University of New Hampshire and Montserrat College of Arts.\n Prior to coming to Andover, she lived in Shanghai, China for five years. It was there that she found inspiration for her second novel, “Art of Floating,” which will be released in 2014. \n “Especially as a writer, I think it is really important for you to live in a country other than your own for at least some period so you experience the food, the history, the culture and be inspired,” said O’Keeffe. \n After Holm announced her retirement this year, the school released an application for the position to all current Andover employees and the general public. Over 30 candidates were interviewed for the job, according to Holm.\n “We looked for someone who is creative, possesses strong writing skills, understands the importance and power of ‘story,’ has good organizational and management abilities, understands the important role the alumni magazine plays in building community and support for Andover and is capable of building strong relationships with the multiple constituencies on campus,” wrote Holm in her e-mail to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'May 1, 2013'), ('\nNext year, 319 new students will join the Andover community.

Before his presentation on Monday, Joseph Brophy Toledo, a medicine man from the Jémez Pueblo, led Andover community members in this game to connect with the Earth.\n Drawing on his knowledge of healing and teaching, Brophy discussed the Jémez Pueblo Natives’ view of the relationship between humans and Earth. He also discussed the traditions of his people and the legend of the “Earth People,” offering a different perspective on how people relate to the environment on Earth Day. \n According to the Jémez tradition, people were created from the Earth. “[The Creator] said, ‘The way I’m going to design an Earth person is exactly how I designed Mother Earth,’” said Brophy. Thus the Jémez people feel a powerful connection with the Earth, Brophy said . \n “We are all equal; we are all earth people,” said Brophy.

So everything is man-solvable.” After the lecture, speaking on the theme of equality, he added, “If we work together, I guarantee that we could succeed more.”\n Brophy also talked about his experiences with healing. “[Healing] was automatically in me when I was growing, as a young boy, because healing was on my mind all the time… It was all natural; it was already in me. I think I was reincarnated, that I lived a long time before, and when I came back I had this knowledge of healing,” said Brophy.\n As a medicine man, Brophy has practiced herbalism and healing since he was 11 years old. He also graduated from the University of New Mexico School of Medicine as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). He believes that the strongest medicine blends Western and Native practices.\n “They always called our medicines ‘alternative’ but that term has changed. Now, it’s ‘complimentary’… because the doctors understand that Western medicine has a lot of side-effects, and then you come to an herbalist, like me. I take care of all the side-effects,” said Brophy.\n In addition, Brophy spoke about his experiences as a medicine man and knowledge of medicinal herbs and Native healing techniques. He claims he has cured people after strokes. Ali Belinkie ’13, Publicity Director of the Archaeology and History Club, met Brophy over the summer on the Pecos Pathways program and helped organize his visit with funds from the Abbot Academy Association. \n “[During my hike with him,] he kept picking up all the plants and saying ‘this does this, eat it!’ and it was so cool and so interesting. I just thought he should come to Andover and share his knowledge with the community,” said Belinkie.\n In addition to his status as a healer, Brophy served as the Lieutenant Governor for the Pueblo of Jémez. In this role, he hosted the first Native American Sports Convention in 1993 with the U.S. Olympics Committee.

I took a two month break, found a job, got married to my wife, have two children and own two houses,” said former United States Sergeant Dennis Maher. Maher, who spent 19 years in jail fighting to prove himself innocent after receiving life imprisonment for two rapes and an attempted rape, was finally exonerated with legal help from the New England Innocence Project (NEIP) in 2003. Brought by Mock Trial, Maher spoke to the Andover community about his wrongful conviction and his journey to prove his innocence. The NEIP, according to the project website, is a national organization comprised of attorneys dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing. In March and April of 1984, Maher was tried and found guilty of two rapes and an attempted rape. Maher said the false conviction was based, in large part, on police bias during the identification process. When witnesses or victims are asked to identify the alleged perpetrator, the official heading the investigation may often inadvertently “lead” the witness to incorrectly identify one person over the others. “I speak because it’s a good way for me to give back to the people who fought to prove my innocence. There’s a double-blind system in this country that is the reason for numerous false convictions,” said Maher. Following the false conviction, Maher took it upon himself to do independent legal work in order to prove his innocence during his 19-year imprisonment. He filed for numerous appeals and motions, all of which were denied. “I filed motions for a paternity test to test the blood to see if it matched mine…they all had to go in front of a sentencing judge. He denied everything without a final hearing,” said Maher. Maher’s turning point came in 2000, when he finally successfully contacted the New England Innocence Project (NEIP). The NEIP assigned two attorneys, Aliza Kaplan and Karin Burns, to Maher’s case. Initially, their attempts to find evidence to compare Maher’s DNA sample were met with false claims that it had been destroyed or lost after 19 years. After months of digging, however, the lawyers were able to uncover the old evidence, which they then sent to a forensics lab in California to be analyzed. The findings exonerated him of his first prison sentence in 2002. Ten days after Maher’s first exoneration, a DNA slide linked to the second and third victims was found by Burns and Kaplan, exonerating him from his life imprisonment and ultimately leading to his release in April of 2003. “I told the press I was overwhelmed when I left the courthouse that day. It was just so much to take in and so much to be thankful for,” said Maher. Maher emphasized that anyone has the ability to make a difference in the lives of others. “I wanted you guys to realize that wrongful convictions do happen in this country, and to make people aware that you can make a difference in the future,” said Maher. “Strive to be the best, and make a difference in your country, in the world. If the young generation steps up to help, then a difference can be made.” “When he talked about how he rebuilt his life, it astonished me… It really comes to show that no matter what obstacles you have to deal with, you can still build up a good life for yourself,” said Devontae Freeland ’15. “Usually, [people are] given the justice standpoint with judges and lawyers. With [Maher], we were given a different perspective [about] the justice system here in America and what it’s like for the convicted,” said Ben Croen ’13, co-head of Mock Trial. Maher now works as a diesel mechanic and travels around the New England area to different universities and high schools to retell his story.

Peabody museum last Saturday. Presenters discussed their research on the year’s topic, “Black Archaeology in New England: Theory, Dialogue and Interpretation.” Seven researchers presented at this year’s conference, with topics ranging from discussions of segregated cemeteries in New England to the history of African American maritime activity. Speakers included Whitney Battle-Baptiste, Kathleen Wheeler, David Landon, Kate McBrien, Jason Mancini and Matthew Lawrence. “This conference was significant because it focused on a minority group, African Americans, that is often overlooked in New England archaeology. Much more attention is traditionally paid to Native Americans, Puritans or Revolutionary War history,” said Lindsay Randall, Peabody Museum Educator. There were two sessions during the conference, a morning session and an afternoon session. Battle-Baptiste presented first and discussed the importance of focusing on post-emancipation black archaeology in New England. Battle-Baptiste is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Lawrence, a Maritime Archaeologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, then explained how one can learn more about African-American contributions to maritime heritage by studying the shipwreck of the 1898 Portland. Later, Wheeler, who is part of Independent Archaeological Consulting, LLC, spoke about a recently-discovered segregated burial ground under an urban street in New England and how she analyzed the remains there. As the first presenter of the afternoon session, Landon discussed the importance of The African Meeting House in Boston’s black community during the 19th century. Landon is the Associate Director of the Andrew Fiske Memorial Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Mancini evaluated interactions between communities of color in Connecticut. Mancini is a Senior Historic Researcher at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center. Lastly, McBrien and Sanford presented their thought processes and research on creating an exhibit at the Maine State Museum in honor of of Malaga Island’s black community, which was forced off of the island in the 20th century. Having previously been held at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Harvard University, this was the first time the conference had been hosted at Andover. There are plans for Andover to host the conference in future years as well, according to Taylor. This year’s conference only drew around 25 people, compared to last year’s, which drew a record 85 people to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Even with the smaller turnout, however, the conference ran smoothly and successfully, said Taylor. “It was great to see so much attention paid to an underappreciated segment of New England archaeology. I think the conference helped to foster new conversations,” said Randall. Every year, the conference focuses on a different topic related to New England archaeology. Past conference topics include “Emerging Trends in Paleo-Indian Interpretation,” “Archaeology of Race and Ethnicity” and “Human Burials,” according to Taylor. The Conference on New England Archaeology has met annually since 1979 in order to strengthen communication and facilitate an exchange of information among New England archaeologists, according to the conference website. This group is the only affiliate group to span all of New England, as opposed to others which represent archaeologists from a single state, according to Taylor. The conference is organized by the Conference on New England Archaeology Steering Committee, which includes eight archaeology academics.

Some students and faculty were concerned about students being able to participate in class that day, according to Fisher. “While the day is about sacrificing your voice, I don’t think that sacrificing your voice is something that should be met with not being able to perform as well in the class,” she said.

I think I was reincarnated, that I lived a long time before, and when I came back I had this knowledge of healing,” said Brophy.\n As a medicine man, Brophy has practiced herbalism and healing since he was 11 years old. He also graduated from the University of New Mexico School of Medicine as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). He believes that the strongest medicine blends Western and Native practices.\n “They always called our medicines ‘alternative’ but that term has changed. Now, it’s ‘complimentary’… because the doctors understand that Western medicine has a lot of side-effects, and then you come to an herbalist, like me. I take care of all the side-effects,” said Brophy.\n In addition, Brophy spoke about his experiences as a medicine man and knowledge of medicinal herbs and Native healing techniques. He claims he has cured people after strokes. Ali Belinkie ’13, Publicity Director of the Archaeology and History Club, met Brophy over the summer on the Pecos Pathways program and helped organize his visit with funds from the Abbot Academy Association. \n “[During my hike with him,] he kept picking up all the plants and saying ‘this does this, eat it!’ and it was so cool and so interesting. I just thought he should come to Andover and share his knowledge with the community,” said Belinkie.\n In addition to his status as a healer, Brophy served as the Lieutenant Governor for the Pueblo of Jémez. In this role, he hosted the first Native American Sports Convention in 1993 with the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also works as a Youth Leadership Specialist with the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and teaches wellness and healing techniques in the Pueblo education system.\n\n', 'Apr 25, 2013'), ('\nAfter weeks of debate, commentary articles in The Phillipian and a heated election cycle, 12 Seniors created “Feminism is Equality,” a website to address common misconceptions about the feminism movement and the gender norms at Andover.

Hoping to educate the greater school community, the Seniors included vocabulary to frame the discussion, such as “microaggression” and “sexism,” and resources for further reading on the topic on the website. Feminism is Equality also started a group on Facebook, called “Feminism at Andover,” open to all Andover students, to facilitate discussion throughout the Andover community. The members of Feminism is Equality started designing the website towards the end of Winter Term, but they sped up the launch of the website after learning that “The New York Times” was writing an article about female leadership at Andover titled “School Vote Stirs Debate on Girls as Leaders.” “We expected there to be a lot of criticism [after the article] because the reporter did touch on some sensitive subjects, but we didn’t expect people to be more focused on the original writing of the article itself than of the message.

Starting this year, the university will hold three eight-week sessions during the academic year and one six-week session during the summer. \n Draper hopes the school will foster a new generation of entrepreneurs, focusing not only on the academic side of building a startup, such as finance, public speaking and marketing, but also on the “survival skills” needed to succeed as an entrepreneur.\n “Every day is different at Draper University. One day you’ll be interviewing entrepreneurs, and the next day you’ll be in a yoga class, and the next day you’ll be cooking, and then there’s survival camping, and ‘deathball’… and at the end, you pitch [an idea] to a panel of venture capitalists for two minutes,” Draper said.\n Andover served as the inspiration for Draper University’s boarding school-like campus. “I thought, ‘Well, Andover was so great, what a great experience we all had; I should start something like that in my experience,’” Draper said.\n Draper said that the liberal arts experience helped him in the world of venture capital and entrepreneurship. “At Andover, I learned poetry; I learned acting, music, all these wide things. Having this broad swath of learning really helped me,” said Draper.\n The founding of Draper University is only the latest in a string of Draper’s risky yet highly successful projects. Draper was one of the first venture capitalists to invest beyond the United States in countries such as India, Estonia, China, Russia, Singapore and Ukraine. Draper argued that the globalization of venture capital, the amount of money invested in relatively new or risky start ups, helps increase competition and quality of innovation. \n For example, after initially unsuccessful investments in China, Draper said, “We decided to back entrepreneurs that were extraordinary in one way or another. They had this energy, this enthusiasm, and they wanted to work their hardest to succeed.” With this credo, Draper invested in Baidu, the hugely successful Chinese search engine often referred to as the “Google of China.”\n “Nowadays, there is a huge demand for creativity. Because now, if you come up with an idea, it’s going to spread around the world faster than it ever could,” Draper said.\n With regards to investing in Russia, Draper said that the communist past of the country affected its business culture. “Imagine being an entrepreneur, and your parents, their parents and their parents all believe that business is bad. Then, there’s no hope for a country,” he said.\n “If you focus down on need, you get culture of need, and if you focus on opportunity, you get a culture of opportunity,” he continued.\n Draper also emphasized the importance of innovation and thinking beyond what is typically accepted. According to him, great entrepreneurs are iconoclasts. “I also like markets where there is a company like the post office, or ‘the neighborhood’ that you never thought would change, ever, that we now see being redefined by e-mail and Facebook,” said Draper.\n One market Draper hopes will be redefined is the government, which he believes is responsible for over-regulation of business. For example, when Draper purchased an old hotel with the hopes of turning it into Draper University, he later found out he had to pay large sums of money for “change of use” permits. \n “The government has been a monopoly for too long; it really needs competition,” said Draper, who hopes his as well as other’s entrepreneurial efforts will provide this.\n\n', 'Apr 18, 2013'), ('\nStudents in each of the five clusters voted on their representatives in Cluster Council this Wednesday.

S. Peabody Archaeology Museum this Tuesday, hopes to spread awareness about it in order to preserve old factories from this historic industry. Wermiel focused on Wareham and Bridgewater, two of the major Massachusetts cities where iron manufacturing dominated. Wermiel’s passion for Massachusetts’ former iron industry is evident. “I guess what impresses me about the 19th century, and it’s sort of true about Massachusetts in general, is that we don’t have a lot of natural resources here… [Iron workers] were using their brains and their resourcefulness to create products,” said Wermiel in an interview with The Phillipian. On a national level, few iron factories still stand today.

Clutch also prepared nine workshops to give students a chance to interact with social entrepreneurs. \n Workshop topics ranged from food as a platform for social change, community development and organizing, marketing and sustainability.\n “I think the people who wanted to learn more about social entrepreneurship were able to find meaning in the presentations and [the] workshops,” said Elaine Sohng ’13, a co-head of Clutch. Along with Sohng, Suzanne Wang ’13 and Jordan Boudreau ’14 are also Co-Heads. \n Wang initially created the club with the intent to make an organization on campus about social innovation. Sohng and Boudreau decided to collaborate with Wang to host a single conference on social entrepreneurship.\n Boudreau, Sohng and Wang contacted local organizations dedicated to finding innovative solutions to social problems, said Sohng. \n “Having [the conference] be a completely student-driven program was an extremely rewarding experience, yet at the same time incredibly challenging. Hopefully, we laid a solid foundation for other students to continue our work,” said Sohng. \n The Clutch Conference was made possible by a $6,150 Abbot Grant received in Fall 2012, according to a previous article in The Phillipian.\n Max Schorr ’99\n “It is no longer about one Gandhi or one Martin Luther King making a difference in the 21st century, but rather about every single one of us doing our part in our everyday lives,” said Max Schorr ’99, co-founder of GOOD, as he shared his personal experiences as a social entrepreneur with the Andover community.\n GOOD considers itself to be a platform for making a difference in the world. It consists of two components. The first is marketed to the general public as an online community, where people can post their own ideas on ways to improve the world, and it also includes a quarterly printed magazine. The second component is GOOD Corps, a media platform that acts as a think tank and consultation service for various organizations hoping to become both profitable and socially responsible, according to the GOOD and GOOD Corps website. \n Schorr kicked off the Clutch Collaborative conference by encouraging students to become interested in social entrepreneurship and think about making a difference in the world.\n “Coming through Andover and out of college, I was faced with the dilemma of how to achieve a level of financial success [while] at the same time doing good for the society,” said Schorr.\n He continued, “There is this idea in people’s mind that if you were making money, there is absolutely no way you could be meaning to help the world. But neither paths suited me perfectly.”\n With his determination to find a combination of the two goals that were considered polar opposites at the time, Schorr began to look into the field of social entrepreneurship.\n Ben Goldhirsh ’99, the other co-founder of GOOD and a close friend of Schorr’s at Andover, proposed the idea of creating a network of people who all have the common goal of doing good for the community.\n “The term good-doer was a pejorative term in our society and we wanted to bring this model that we learned while growing up at Andover: that doing good was cool,” Schorr said.\n “Increasingly, the line between searching for self-comfort and being a social good-doer is disappearing, and I think [this] fact is very encouraging. It is important for people to realize that they are not alone in this desire to do both,” Schorr said in an interview with The Phillipian.\n “I wanted people, especially students who are the next generation leaders, to feel like they can go out and actually make a difference in the community,” he said.\n Addressing the challenges he faced as he worked to establish and publicize GOOD, Schorr encouraged the students to find a passion that will allow them to push through the inevitable challenges and setbacks life presents.\n “You have to tap into your meaning. You have to have some sort of inner strength to keep going, especially because when doing social entrepreneurship work, you are going to experience a lot of poverty firsthand,” he said.\n Schorr said he first found his passion for social work on an Andover school trip to South Africa. “I remember looking out the window of the car as we drove down the street of Soweto and seeing things like tin-roofed houses. I have never seen such poverty of this nature before, and I was confused because one one level, how can people have to live in such situations like this, but on the other level, how come they look so much happier than people I know back home,” said Schorr. \n Growing up as a faculty child on Andover’s campus and then later attending the school, Schorr said that Andover grew to be something more than just school for him. Andover is and will continue to be his home, his “meaning” that helps him persevere through all difficulties, he said. \n Schorr said that he was extremely excited and honored to have the opportunity to speak at such a meaningful place for him, especially since his mother, Natalie Schorr, Instructor and Chair in French, will be retiring this year after 40 years working as a teacher at Andover.\n David Scheffer\n After reading “How Nations Behave” in the Harvard Library, David Scheffer, Director of the Center for International Human Rights, Professor of Law at Northwestern University School of Law and former U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, discovered his passion for both law and foreign policy. Inspired, he decided to dedicate his life to international criminal justice—bringing the architects of mass atrocities to justice.\n Scheffer has since helped to create five major tribunals: the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts Cambodia (ECCC), the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Special Court of Sierra Leone.\n During his presentation on Sunday, Scheffer said, “Within the last 20 years, we have changed the world—there is no longer the presumption of leadership impunity in the world. Yes, there will be leaders who get away with crimes against humanity, some who even die without ever having to enter a courtroom, but that is a reality. It is a slow process, but frankly over the past 20 years we have gone warp speed on this issue.”\n “Timing is everything. If you miss the opportunity to deal with any atrocities you will be overwhelmed with the reality of the disaster,” he added.\n Scheffer shared several experiences, including those while working as U.S Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues and within the International Justice System. . \n “I know that one of your great challenges here at Phillips is that you have a lot to study and a lot to accomplish and engage in, but I believe the biggest favor you can do yourself right now, at this stage of your life, is build a vision,” said Scheffer.\n “You don’t have to travel around the world to build a vision. You can build a vision in the library,” he continued.\n He said, “There was one moment where I either had to seize that original vision of pursuing international criminal justice or I had to sacrifice it for the rest of my life. I was either going to become a partner of the law firm or pursue that vision that I had way back in college.”\n Scheffer chose to leave the law firm to travel to Washington and follow his dreams. Since leaving the law firm, he has not only traveled around the world, but has also worked with several influential people including Madeleine Albright, former United States Secretary of State.\n “I want people today to be inspired to help the world through their careers based on their vision. I also wanted to bring to this audience’s attention that although the unfortunate reality is that there are atrocities on our planet, there are measures being taken, such as the creation law tribunals,” said Scheffer. \n Scheffer is also an instructor of International Human Rights Law and International Criminal Law at Northwestern University.\n\n', 'Apr 18, 2013'), ('\nJosh Kim ’15 recently discovered that an existing star had eclipsing variable properties, which were previously unknown, while researching for his Winter Term Astronomy Research class, led by Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics. In January, the class took a series of pictures of the night sky. Kim then searched the images in mid-February for variable stars and was able to identify one. Stars are usually constant in their brightness. Variable stars are stars whose degree of brightness changes. There are two main reasons why the degree of brightness might vary, said Kim. The first is that star itself is oscillating in size and this is called a pulsating variable. The second reason is that the star is actually a system of two stars, a binary star system. When the two stars rotate around each other, one eclipses the other and decreases the amount of light seen from earth. The star that Kim found is a binary star system. He was able to deduce this from the data and images collected during the astronomy course. Kim said that the stars were so close to each other that they appeared to be only one star at first. “I was looking for a variable star, but I never expected that there was actually going to be a variable star. I was searching the image, but only just in case I would find something,” said Kim. Kim said that when the observatory takes images, they take three to five minute exposures. According to Kim, starlight can be extremely faint and exposing the camera for minutes at a time is necessary. The star that Kim found is 630 times dimmer than the faintest star the naked eye can see. The American Association Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) is the official organization that handles discoveries concerning variable stars. The AAVSO produces a catalogue of all the variable stars that have been discovered, listed by coordinates. Upon detecting the variable star, Kim looked up the star on the AAVSO catalogue and was not able to find it. According to Kim, there is also a catalog that covers all stars known to man called the 2Mass Star Catalog. When Kim searched this catalogue, he found that the star was, in fact, there. “A lot of people say that I discovered a star, but I didn’t discover a star. I discovered that the star has special properties,” said Kim. It was previously unknown that the star was variable and part of a binary star system. “I think my discovery is unique and special because, not only is it a binary star system, it is a binary star system that has a very short rotation period,” said Kim. The rotation period is the amount of time it takes for a star to return to its original position. Kim said that most eclipsing variable stars have rotation period ranging from days to many years. In contrast, the rotation period of Kim’s star is only 8.3 hours. “That means that the two stars are really close to each other. It’s called a contact binary. In that way, my discovery is special,” said Kim. Kim was aided by Odden and John Briggs ’77, who works as a professional astronomer in Colorado. Briggs also worked at Andover as a visiting physicist and often helps students with research projects. Upon hearing about the star, Briggs took many images of the star from Colorado. Kim, Odden and Briggs confirmed the discovery by reviewing the combined data in a cumulative graph. Before Winter Term, Kim did not have any knowledge of astronomy. He credits Odden for his newly found interest and passion, but acknowledges that he still has much to learn. “I think astronomy is a field that you can do a lot of research with. I basically did experiment-based learning. I learned astronomy bit by bit through the process of doing research and experimenting,” said Kim. Kim plans to publish a paper about his discovery. He will write about the discovery and analysis of the star in the Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. When reflecting upon his experience, Kim said that what impressed him the most was the importance of collaboration in science. “I did learn a lot about how scientists work together in terms of gathering data and asking each other about discoveries and interpretations,” said Kim. Kim used equipment in the Andover observatory, primarily a 16-inch reflector telescope. John Briggs, an astronomer in Colorado, used the same telescope. Kim said he looks forward to studying all the aspects of physics, including astronomy, in college. In the future, Kim hopes to be an amateur astronomer while pursuing careers in other fields.\n\n', 'Apr 18, 2013'), ('\nLast Saturday at 12:30 a.m., a team of 27 dedicated Andover students returned to their dorms after participating in the American Cancer Society’s annual Relay for Life overnight event at the Brooks School.

Relay for Life is an overnight community fundraising walk that raises awareness and funds for cancer research and support. The event has three main components: the Survivors Lap, a lap around the track to acknowledge all cancer survivors and caregivers, the Luminaria Ceremony, where participants light candles inside of personalized paper bags to honor those who have lost the battle with cancer, and the Fight Back Ceremony, where participants express their emotional commitment to fighting cancer. The entire Pine Knoll (PKN) cluster council participated in the event. “PKN cluster council decided to partake in this event because we were not only looking for ways to build a sense of community in our cluster, but also to inform the students about the significance of the cause,” said Aya Murata, faculty advisor of Andover’s Relay for Life team.

The event has no clear starting date, but was first noted by The Phillipian around 1910, according to Chen. \n One of the highlights of the day, according to Edward Molé, co-head of The Philomathean Society (Philo) was the final exhibition round. In this debate, the co-heads of each school’s team sat down for a formal debate to argue the resolution: “Be it resolved that Andover is better than Exeter.”\n “The resolution was decided by our advisor [Elizabeth Tully] and our Director in Training, John French [’13]. We didn’t know the resolution until around five minutes before we went into the exhibition round,” said Haonan Li, co-head of Philo. \n “We had to argue that Exeter was better, whereas they had to argue that Andover was better, which was very entertaining and enjoyable to do,” Li added.\n Members of Philo noted that this debate presented a unique opportunity for students from each school to get to know each other, which is unusual for an interscholastic competition, according to Alex Sweeting ’14, Philo Associate. \n “It was a lot more personal than most other debates. There was a little lunch that occurred during the debate where we were able to socialize with everyone for a good amount of time,” said Sweeting. \n One of the main concerns with the debate was the event’s scheduling, which prevented many members from both teams from being able to participate.\n “Because of the lack of Seniors, we were able to put Uppers and Lowers from both sides in the debate. In that sense, it was great because we were able to debate against people who will be in leadership positions next year. I like that, because again, we will be able to form a stronger bond between the two clubs, fostering a better relationship,” said Sweeting.\n Although the debate largely retained the same parliamentary format as most tournaments Philo attends, Li noted that this event had to be limited to two rounds of debates because of a limited amount of participants, as well as time constraints.\n “This year was almost a trial run. We’re going to try and at least double the event in size. Ideally, we would love everyone in Philo to come and participate,” said Chen.\n Once the debate had come to a close, Sweeting and Chen were awarded the distinction of First Advanced Pair for the tournament. Rachel Murree ’14 was awarded First Advanced Speaker, and Harshita Gaba ’14 was named Second Novice Speaker. Andover won in the Advanced Division and Exeter won in the Novice Divisions.\n The Andover-Exeter debate will run in future years with the same format as traditional rival competitions, so each school will alternate as host.

One day you’ll be interviewing entrepreneurs, and the next day you’ll be in a yoga class, and the next day you’ll be cooking, and then there’s survival camping, and ‘deathball’… and at the end, you pitch [an idea] to a panel of venture capitalists for two minutes,” Draper said.\n Andover served as the inspiration for Draper University’s boarding school-like campus. “I thought, ‘Well, Andover was so great, what a great experience we all had; I should start something like that in my experience,’” Draper said.\n Draper said that the liberal arts experience helped him in the world of venture capital and entrepreneurship. “At Andover, I learned poetry; I learned acting, music, all these wide things. Having this broad swath of learning really helped me,” said Draper.\n The founding of Draper University is only the latest in a string of Draper’s risky yet highly successful projects. Draper was one of the first venture capitalists to invest beyond the United States in countries such as India, Estonia, China, Russia, Singapore and Ukraine. Draper argued that the globalization of venture capital, the amount of money invested in relatively new or risky start ups, helps increase competition and quality of innovation. \n For example, after initially unsuccessful investments in China, Draper said, “We decided to back entrepreneurs that were extraordinary in one way or another. They had this energy, this enthusiasm, and they wanted to work their hardest to succeed.” With this credo, Draper invested in Baidu, the hugely successful Chinese search engine often referred to as the “Google of China.”\n “Nowadays, there is a huge demand for creativity. Because now, if you come up with an idea, it’s going to spread around the world faster than it ever could,” Draper said.\n With regards to investing in Russia, Draper said that the communist past of the country affected its business culture. “Imagine being an entrepreneur, and your parents, their parents and their parents all believe that business is bad. Then, there’s no hope for a country,” he said.\n “If you focus down on need, you get culture of need, and if you focus on opportunity, you get a culture of opportunity,” he continued.\n Draper also emphasized the importance of innovation and thinking beyond what is typically accepted. According to him, great entrepreneurs are iconoclasts. “I also like markets where there is a company like the post office, or ‘the neighborhood’ that you never thought would change, ever, that we now see being redefined by e-mail and Facebook,” said Draper.\n One market Draper hopes will be redefined is the government, which he believes is responsible for over-regulation of business. For example, when Draper purchased an old hotel with the hopes of turning it into Draper University, he later found out he had to pay large sums of money for “change of use” permits. \n “The government has been a monopoly for too long; it really needs competition,” said Draper, who hopes his as well as other’s entrepreneurial efforts will provide this.\n\n', 'Apr 18, 2013'), ('\nStudents in each of the five clusters voted on their representatives in Cluster Council this Wednesday.

Andover’s team raised just over $2,000 for the American Cancer Society, bringing them to the Rising Star Team Fundraising Club Level, which is awarded to every team that raises over $1,000. Relay for Life is an overnight community fundraising walk that raises awareness and funds for cancer research and support. The event has three main components: the Survivors Lap, a lap around the track to acknowledge all cancer survivors and caregivers, the Luminaria Ceremony, where participants light candles inside of personalized paper bags to honor those who have lost the battle with cancer, and the Fight Back Ceremony, where participants express their emotional commitment to fighting cancer. The entire Pine Knoll (PKN) cluster council participated in the event. “PKN cluster council decided to partake in this event because we were not only looking for ways to build a sense of community in our cluster, but also to inform the students about the significance of the cause,” said Aya Murata, faculty advisor of Andover’s Relay for Life team. This year’s event at Brooks raised a total of $24,000 for the American Cancer Society.

The event has no clear starting date, but was first noted by The Phillipian around 1910, according to Chen. \n One of the highlights of the day, according to Edward Molé, co-head of The Philomathean Society (Philo) was the final exhibition round. In this debate, the co-heads of each school’s team sat down for a formal debate to argue the resolution: “Be it resolved that Andover is better than Exeter.”\n “The resolution was decided by our advisor [Elizabeth Tully] and our Director in Training, John French [’13]. We didn’t know the resolution until around five minutes before we went into the exhibition round,” said Haonan Li, co-head of Philo. \n “We had to argue that Exeter was better, whereas they had to argue that Andover was better, which was very entertaining and enjoyable to do,” Li added.\n Members of Philo noted that this debate presented a unique opportunity for students from each school to get to know each other, which is unusual for an interscholastic competition, according to Alex Sweeting ’14, Philo Associate. \n “It was a lot more personal than most other debates. There was a little lunch that occurred during the debate where we were able to socialize with everyone for a good amount of time,” said Sweeting. \n One of the main concerns with the debate was the event’s scheduling, which prevented many members from both teams from being able to participate.\n “Because of the lack of Seniors, we were able to put Uppers and Lowers from both sides in the debate. In that sense, it was great because we were able to debate against people who will be in leadership positions next year. I like that, because again, we will be able to form a stronger bond between the two clubs, fostering a better relationship,” said Sweeting.\n Although the debate largely retained the same parliamentary format as most tournaments Philo attends, Li noted that this event had to be limited to two rounds of debates because of a limited amount of participants, as well as time constraints.\n “This year was almost a trial run. We’re going to try and at least double the event in size. Ideally, we would love everyone in Philo to come and participate,” said Chen.\n Once the debate had come to a close, Sweeting and Chen were awarded the distinction of First Advanced Pair for the tournament. Rachel Murree ’14 was awarded First Advanced Speaker, and Harshita Gaba ’14 was named Second Novice Speaker. Andover won in the Advanced Division and Exeter won in the Novice Divisions.\n The Andover-Exeter debate will run in future years with the same format as traditional rival competitions, so each school will alternate as host. The debate will occur at Exeter next year.\n\n', 'Apr 18, 2013'), ('\nLast Sunday, Andover hosted Sunil Gulati, the current president of the United States Soccer Federation, along with three other panelists and a total of 85 coaches, athletes, and parents for a panel on recent changes in youth sports development and soccer in particular. Issues that the panel addressed ranged from whether children should specialize in a sport at an early age and the looming gap between men’s and women’s professional soccer despite the recent success of the women’s national team, to the role of parents on the sidelines. Coach Bill Scott, head coach of Andover’s Boys Varsity Soccer, first conceived the conference idea in the wake of the formation of the United States Soccer Development Academy. The Academy essentially forces young soccer players to choose between playing development or high school, and was controversial due to the deep rooted high school team sports in American culture unseen in Europe, said Scott. “What they were doing is modeling the new US approach to soccer after the German approach,” said Coach Scott. “Totally controversial, I thought it would be great to have a conversation about it and sports specialization, and about life balance for kids in terms of their commitments to academics and sports.” “After Sunil Gulati contacted me about two years ago asking for my opinion, I grew close to him. Recently, when I suggested this, he said yes right away,” he continued. “I thought it was a wonderful opportunity.” Gulati has had extensive experience and influence on soccer in the US, serving as the Vice President of the US Soccer Federation for six years before being elected President in 2006 and re-elected again in 2010. Joining him on the panel moderated by Dean Conway, a prominent leader in youth soccer in Massachusetts, were three other renowned figures in the athletic world—Mike Burns, current General Manager for the New England Revolution and former starter for the US national team, Jennifer Hughes, head coach of the women’s soccer team at Amherst College, and Christina Fink, two time Olympian and sports psychologist. “It was a really dynamic group of people,” said Coach Scott. The variety and expertise provided by all four panelists fueled the in-depth discussion and shed light on current issues for young soccer players that resonated deeply with current Andover athletes. “I learned about how hard it is to be a soccer player at an elite level, as opposed to just an average one,” said Dylan Mott ’15, who has played on the same team as Gulati’s son and introduced Gulati on Sunday. “I learned about how much time you have to put into it.” Hannah Guzzi ’14 said, “It was really interesting to hear, especially Sunil Gulati’s opinions on the questions they posed, and especially youth development because my dad has been my soccer coach ever since I came here, so I can give him the information too.” She added, “I learned so much, and it was cool to be with people so many people so invested in soccer.” “It was really personal; [Gulati] was unbelievably funny and charismatic and cared about the game,” said Graeme Henderson ’14. “I liked that there were a bunch of prep school teams there that really cared not only about expanding women’s game but also helping the prep league become better.” The two-hour long panel held in Davis Hall on Abbot Campus left the audience with a sense of promise, both on a personal and a larger, global scale. “The future looks good under Sunil,” said Andy Manos ’16, another member of Andover soccer. “I learned that Sunil knows a lot about the game, has got a lot to say, and has high hopes for the future of the youth program in America, both girls and boys, and both women’s and men’s professional soccer in America.” “It was great to hear about what they have to do to improve, the package deals they’re trying to do, and I learned how to treat my siblings playing soccer since that’s always been a grey area for me,” said Josh Murphy ’15, also a family friend of Gulati’s. “I hope that they [hold a similar panel] again.”\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nLast Friday, April 5, Becky Sykes, Associate Head of School, received the McKeen Award for her commitment to embracing diversity at Andover, exhibited through her active role in adopting equal-opportunity policies for underrepresented students and her creation of the Brace Center for Gender Studies and the Girls’ Leadership Project (GLP). \n The McKeen award, given annually since 1998 by the Brace Center, honors those who have worked to eliminate social and institutional barriers for students. It is given in the spirit of Philena McKeen, a former principal of Abbot Academy known for her efforts to establish a healthy community in which all girls could thrive, according to Diane Moore, Director of the Brace Center.\n “I did not see myself as a possible honoree but was inspired by my selection to work harder to help young women see themselves as leaders and develop the leadership skills they need for whatever their aspirations,” wrote Sykes, in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n Sykes joined the Andover faculty in 1973, which coincided with the first year of coeducation at the school. In her 40-year career, she has held several diverse positions, including telephone operator, house counselor, cluster dean, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) and, currently, Associate Head of School, according to Moore.\n “In all of her roles, she has worked tirelessly to create a school culture where diversities are embraced as strengths and where individuals are always treated with dignity and respect,” said Moore.\n Sykes helped to create policies providing equal rights to same-sex couples and equal opportunities for women and people of color, and was on the original planning committee for the Brace Center, She helped to pen its statement of purpose, according to Moore. Sykes was also selected to be a Brace Faculty Fellow. \n “Ms. Sykes has been an exceptional leader in her time here. She combines the skills of a great administrator and a great social worker, and that’s really unusual. She leads not by force or fiat but by encouragement, persuasion and example,” said Tony Rotundo, Instructor in History and Social Science and former Co-Director of the Brace Center.\n She helped found the Girls’ Leadership Project in 2009, and worked on it with Jenny Elliott, Instructor in History and Social Science, Sarah Coghlan, Assistant Director of Community Service, and Kathleen Dalton, Instructor in History and Social Science. What began as a mentorship project with a group of Lower girls soon grew into an on-campus lecture series designed to teach young women leadership and practical skills.\n “Coeducation has enriched the experience of all the students and faculty of the last 40 years. Gender is an important element of our identity and an influence on how we interact with one another,” said Sykes.\n Sykes, in an e-mail to The Phillipian, wrote that she was proud that Andover has maintained the highest educational and ethical standards through institutional changes, including the creation of the Brace Center, the presence of more women and people of color in leadership and the expanded access to Andover for “youth from every quarter.”\n “I am so proud of our school’s ability to address even the topics that might divide us. I hope that from now throughout the next 15 months as we acknowledge coeducation at 40 years [COED@40] that we will both celebrate the benefits of being an institution that educates girls and boys and examine with a critical eye what we have yet to accomplish,” said Sykes.\n In addition to the initiatives of the student-faculty COED@40 Committee, which Sykes co-chairs with Debby Murphy, Director of Alumni Affairs, the Brace Center and the Abbot Academy Association are working to raise awareness of what coeducation has given Andover, according to Sykes.\n Sykes receiving the McKeen Award marks the honor’s 15th year. Former Head of School Barbara Chase, in addition to her own remarks, read a tribute to Sykes written by Head of School John Palfrey. Palfrey could not be in attendance due to a scheduling conflict, according to Moore.\n The McKeen Award recipient is selected by the Advisory Committee of the Brace Center.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nOn Wednesday, Ruth Wisse, Harvard professor and award-winning author, gave a lecture titled “Jews and Power: Between Holocaust Remembrance Day and Israel Independence Day,” inspired by her book “Jews and Power.” Her presentation focused on Holocaust Remembrance Day and Israel Independence Day, two 20th century Jewish holidays celebrated within eight days of one another, and their connection to the seven-week period between Passover and Shavuot, which represents the time between the Jews’ passage out of Egypt and Moses’s receipt of the Torah on Mount Sinai. Wisse said that these seven weeks have taken on a new significance since modern Jews added Holocaust Remembrance Day and Israel Independence Day between the two holidays. “Six million Jews were killed in Europe in this period of several years…. So how come, in the same decade, this people reclaims its own independence and its sovereignty and homeland, after an interval of almost two thousand years?” said Wisse, discussing the Jewish people’s turnaround in the 1940s. “If the first period that we talked about [the seven weeks after Passover] really marks how long it took for the Jews to come out of Egypt and become a civilized, disciplined people, then these two [20th century holidays], this period of just eight days, marks exactly the opposite,” said Wisse. These opposites represent how the Jewish society has matured, according to Wisse. She noted that seven full weeks are needed to commemorate the Jews passage from Egypt to Palestine. “I think that this means that we are meant to understand how long it took for that rabble that left Egypt to become disciplined enough to receive the law from Moses.” In contrast, Jews separate Holocaust Remembrance Day and Israel Independence Day with only eight days to represent “the unparalleled experience of a nation that undergoes unspeakable disaster and almost simultaneously demonstrates its powers of resilience.” Wisse ended her presentation with the argument that the world’s focus on Jewish history should not be on the Holocaust itself, as it often is, because it represented the Jewish people at their lowest point. Instead, the focus should be on what Wisse described as “greater than any supernatural miracle I know… This people, in a few years can suffer this most brutal, humiliating mass-murder and at the same time, reclaim its sovereignty after really 2,000 years of living in other peoples lands.” Wisse also discussed the Holocaust in depth and addressed the issue of Jewish passivity. “Jews could not comprehend the process to which they were being subjected… Jews cannot kill a chicken without first saying the blessing. So how could they believe that a human life would be worth less than a chicken’s? Now what appears like passivity in Jews testifies to levels of ruthlessness in their murderers,” said Wisse. “One third of the Jewish people were murdered in a slaughter that was so unprecedented that [the lawyer] Rafael Lemkin had to invent the word ‘genocide’ in order to describe this slaughter,” said Wisse. Zoe Chazen ’14 and Sam Goldberg ’14, both board members of JSU, invited Wisse after hearing of her work. Wisse is the winner of The National Jewish Book Award for Scholarship and the Jewish Cultural Achievement Award in Scholarship for her writing. “She’s an acclaimed Jewish scholar,” said Chazen, who first heard of Wisse after reading an opinion piece of hers in “The Wall Street Journal.” Wisse, who was born in Romania but raised in Montreal, grew up speaking Yiddish. She decided to study Yiddish literature in the 1950s and attended Columbia University. At the time, Columbia was the only school that offered Yiddish in a graduate degree program. She is currently the Martin Peretz Professor of Yiddish and English Comparative Literature at Harvard University. Adam Brody ’14, noting the contrast between Holocaust Remembrance day and Israel Independence Day, said, “We wanted to sort of talk about that and bring that discussion to campus… And we really were interested in getting Ruth Wisse, and she happened to be available this week.” In addition to Wisse’s lecture, Culture, Politics and Religion Club held a joint meeting with JSU on April 9 to discuss the Holocaust and other examples of genocide. The lecture was sponsored by the Jewish Student Union.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nWith strikingly similar backgrounds, two individuals named Wes Moore grew up in the same Baltimore neighborhood without ever knowing the other existed. While one Wes Moore, a Rhodes Scholar and author of the “New York Times” bestseller, “The Other Wes Moore: One Name Two Fates,” presented at Andover last Friday, the other now serves a life sentence for murder without parole.\n Moore’s keynote speech at the 45th anniversary weekend of the African Latino American Society (Af-Lat-Am) shared not only his story, but also that of the other Wes Moore.\n “I try to make it very clear that the story is not just about [the two kids in the book]. It is about a lot more than just one neighborhood and one socioeconomic group and one race and one generation. It is about all of us. It is about the decisions we make in our lives and the people we have in our lives to help us make those decisions,” said Moore in his speech.\n He continued, “It is not about me, and it is not about him. The name is completely irrelevant because to be honest there are ‘others,’ like Wes Moore, in every one of our communities, schools and hallways. The fact that our society is full of people who live on a different side of town or who might not look like us, speak like us or be sitting in this chapel tonight, but whose destiny matters just as much to the safety and security of our communities as ours does.”\n Moore identifies his education as the differentiating factors between his life and that of the other Wes Moore. Despite a tumultuous childhood in elementary school, Moore ultimately recognized that the choices he made with his education after primary school allowed him to succeed.\n “[Education] will never simply be about a paper that you turn in or a class that you take. The highest definition of higher education means what have you done to best prepare yourself to become a global citizen and then helping to define whom you will fight for,” said Moore.\n He continued, “The most fundamental lesson, not just with these two kids, but also with what they represent, is that education matters. It shapes the way we think about the world, and it changes the people in which we think about it with.”\n Moore graduated from John Hopkins University in 2001 and continued on to complete a Master of Letters (MLitt) degree in international relations from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar in 2004. From 2006-2007, he worked as a White House Fellow, serving as a special assistant to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He then left the White House to become an investment professional at Citigroup, focusing mostly on global technology. Now his main focus is mentoring students and children involved in the criminal justice system. \n Raised in a single-parent household in Baltimore, Moore’s success story seemed unimaginable when he was a child.\n “In many cases, our bios are not our stories. Our wiki pages or a simple paragraph will never tell a whole story about our existence. And not just where we got to, but more importantly how we got there,” said Moore.\n Moore has searched for an answer as to why he was chosen to be the successful one, and why he was given the privilege to be educated versus the other Wes Moore.\n “I am a strong believer that potential in the United States is universal, but opportunity is not and that difference between potential and where we ald up is where we all come in,” said Moore.\n Moore encouraged Andover students to take advantage of their educations.\n “We have many people on this planet right now who are sitting behind the wheel of a Maserati and driving 40 mph. You are behind the wheel of a Maserati. Take the thing out for a spin and see what it can do! All of you are behind the wheel of a Maserati right now, and there is no reason for you to think about driving that thing 40 mph. Push the peddle to the floor, air it out a bit. You will be amazed at how fast that vehicle can go as long as you let it,” said Moore.\n Linda Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development, said that they decided to bring Wes Moore to campus because of a mentoring program on campus called African American Mentoring Program (AMP).\n Griffith said, “In AMP, incoming underrepresented students of color are paired with Uppers and Seniors to help them transition and navigate Andover. Each Christmas I give a book because I am all about reading not just for academic purposes, but also for what I call reading for resilience. It is important to read books about people who have overcome, to remind you that you can too. This was the book I gave out, therefore I thought the 45th reunion would be the perfect time to have Wes Moore come to Andover to speak.”\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAndover’s economics team brought home two first place trophies from the National Economics Challenge Massachusetts state competition held at the Boston Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The team consisted of Jeremy Chen ’13, Rose Wang ’13, Emily Field ’13, Gregory Wang ’13, Hyun Woo Kim ’13, Sahil Bhaiwala ’13, Harvey Wu ’14 and Gregory Young ’13. On April 16, the Andover economics team will proceed to the NEC semi-final round. The winning teams from all 50 states will attend this competition. The team hopes to place in the top four scoring teams of the semi-finals and advance to the National Final Competition, which will be held in New York City in May. “I am amazed that we were able to make it this far, and I hope we can better prepare for the upcoming rounds so that we could return back to the NEC Finals and place first like we did in 2011,” said Bhaiwala. The Economics Challenge consisted of three different competitions, which included Alfred Marshall Division, Adam Smith Division and David Ricardo Division. Andover contended in two of the three competitions, the Alfred Marshall Division and the David Ricardo Division. For the Alfred Marshall Division, teams are required to study current economic situations in a specific region, which is announced during the contest, and are then asked to write up a resolution proposal. The top two teams from the first round then progress to the second round, where they deliver a short presentation about their resolution proposal. The David Ricardo Division consists of two parts: a multiple choice question round and a quiz bowl. The top two teams from the multiple choice question round then compete in the quick-paced oral quiz bowl. Andover was split into two teams of four, one consisting of Kim, Bhaiwala, Wu and Young, and the other consisting of Chen, Rose Wang, Field and Gregory Wang. “Andover’s team had to divide into two groups and compete in two different divisions. Thus, we simultaneously participated in different rooms during the competition,” said Bhaiwala. The first team participated in the Alfred Marshall Division and took the first place trophy. Soon after, the second team took part in the David Ricardo Division, coming in first place with a score of 10-2, beating Belmont Hill School, an opponent they lost to last year. The questions for the Economics Challenge covered several topics of economics, including microeconomics, macroeconomics, international finance theories and current issues. “I am extremely glad that Andover was able to sweep the competition and win all of the competitions that we competed in. We prepared for this competition since Fall Term, and I am happy that all of our hard word paid off,” said Kim. “The Alfred Marshall competition became a new division this year, and being the first winners of this division was the most exciting part for me. I hope this leaves a good mark for the Andover economics team in the future,” Kim added. The Economics Team also traveled to Harvard University this past Saturday to compete at the Harvard Pre-Collegiate Economics Challenge (HPEC). They lost during the Semi- Finals to Choate Rosemary Hall. The Andover Economics Team began practicing for the two competitions at the end of Fall Term. They gathered as a team every Wednesday and Sunday at the Gelb Science Center and the Phillips Academy Computer Center to prepare for the contest, according to Bhaiwala. They mainly studied with “Principles of Economics,” a textbook by Gregory Mankiw, as well as reading daily newspapers for current economic issues and events, according to Kim. Since the Andover economics team did not have a faculty advisor this year, they traveled to their competitions by train.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAlthough the 46 female journalists at “Newsweek” saw little immediate, concrete change after filing a class action lawsuit against the magazine for gender discrimination in 1970, they paved the way for equal access for future female writers.\n When Lynn Povich finally became the first female Senior Editor at “Newsweek” in 1973 after a second suit, these 46 women had already started the long, unfinished movement towards gender equality in the news, Jing Qu ’13, Brace Center Fellow, concluded in her presentation, “Headlines and Bylines: The Changing Voices of Women in Journalism from the 1970s to the Internet Age.” \n The current age of new media, according to Qu, is in the process of creating greater gender equality in journalism. “The average reader has diversified in race, age, gender and socioeconomic class with the accessibility of online articles…I found that the newsroom should reflect its audience, that’s just a good ethical and business decision,” said Qu.\n Qu interviewed nine news journalists, both men and women, including Emma Keller, novelist and contributor to “The Guardian U.S.,” a news website linked to a British national newspaper, and wife of Bill Keller, former Executive Editor of “The New York Times”, as well as Ann Friedman, former editor-in-chief of Good Magazine. “The individuals I interviewed represent the old and the young, they include people who are at the top of the field and people who are just starting out in journalism,” Qu said.\n Through her interviews, Qu saw a difference between the way women at different levels of the newsroom discussed gender inequality. “The women who were at the top of their field were less inclined to talk about inequality, as if it undermined the work they had done…but the women who were starting out were more open to talk about the problems they faced,” Qu said.\n The “Newsweek” lawsuits of the 1970s started a movement of women in journalism demanding equal pay and treatment at other major news outlets such as “The New York Times,” “Time Magazine,” “The Washington Post” and “The Associated Press.” Though none of the news organizations admitted to any wrongdoing, the lawsuits acted as a “wake up call” for management across the profession, according to Qu.\n Women in the newsroom in the 1970s were primarily restricted to Arts and Leisure, Home, Childcare and Food sections, Qu said. The female-heavy sections of the time were also the less popular sections of the newspaper, she added.\n Currently, women make up 48 percent of all editors and reporters, and since 1987, women and men have had equal pay in the newsroom. Women currently make up 39 percent of the “Newsweek” masthead, and the executive editor of The New York Times,” the highest editorial position, is a woman, Jill Abramson. \n Yet, the path to equality is far from finished, Qu says. Women are the subjects of only 24 percent of news stories, and during the 2012 Presidential Election, women accounted for only 16 percent of quotes on the subject in major newspapers. Only 19 percent of all Government and Politics stories in 2010 were about women. As junior-level professionals, men and women are equal, but in top-level management, men make up more than 75 percent of the work force.\n Qu first became interested in her topic while working on The Phillipian as a Photography Associate on the board of CXXIII, the Director of Photography on the board of CXXIV and Director of Production on the board of CXXV. While on the board of The Phillipian, Qu looked through the paper archives and found that only nine of the previous 42 Editors in Chief since the merger with Abbot Academy—21 percent—were female.\n After learning about the atmosphere in The Phillipian newsroom, Qu became interested in women’s rights in professional news publications. “I started to think about a newsroom. . .and whether a newsroom was a meritocracy, whether you were rewarded or promoted based on your hard work, your time and based on your abilities as a journalist,” Qu said.\n Qu’s Brace Fellow Advisor, Sue Greenberg, Instructor in English and advisor to The Phillipian, worked at “Newsweek” for 22 years. “What I learned from Jing’s research was that Lucy Howard [a former colleague] actually played a pretty important role in the fact that I had a job there, and that she was one of the women who had brought this lawsuit against ‘Newsweek,’” Greenberg said.\n “I was fascinated by how she took this massive topic and made a really logical, and comprehensive, and at the same time time, accessible train of thought. The ease with which Jing speaks and the confidence with which she speaks is really inspiring,” said Jennifer Elliott, Abbot Cluster Dean and Instructor in History.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAlthough released without much fanfare in February, the 2013-2014 academic calendar won’t contain Saturday classes for the first time in school history. “Just with the momentum that we’ve had, in terms of going from classes every Saturday… to almost none, it’s a pretty logical progression,” said John Rogers, Dean of Studies. The Office of Academy Resources is still trying to determine what will happen to events like Parent’s Weekend and Grandparent’s Day, which are normally held on Saturdays. While students were never involved in Saturday classes on Parent’s Weekend, it is possible that Grandparent’s Day will be moved to a Friday. Rogers said he had not yet heard of any opposition regarding the change. “I think there are a number of faculty and administrators who would support a different model of Saturday classes, but I think the model that we had just didn’t make sense to anybody,” said Rogers. He added that Saturday classes were unlikely to return. “Going back in that direction, I think it’s pretty tough.” The final decision came from the Head of School’s office on the joint recommendation of the Academic Council, the Senior Administrative Council, the Dean of Studies Office and the Dean of Admissions.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAfter three rounds of voting, a flurry of Letters to the Editor, a final debate at All-School Meeting and 874 counted ballots, Clark Perkins ’14 and Junius Williams ’14 became the first School Co-Presidents at Andover.\n The results of the Co-Presidential race for the 2013-2014 school year were released to the Andover community via e-mail from Hemang Kaul ’13, current School President, and posted on The Phillipian’s website.\n Farris Peale ’14 and Ben Yi ’14 comprised the runner-up pair. Unlike the runner-ups of previous years, they will not serve on Student Council next year, according to the recently rewritten Student Council Constitution. \n The final round of voting opened on Wednesday after All-School Meeting (ASM), during which the two final pairs debated questions posed by Rolando Bonachea ’13, Vice President of Student Council, and MJ Engel ’13, Executive Secretary of Student Council. Voting closed at 10:30 p.m. that night and both candidate pairs received calls from Kaul revealing the results. \n “We will address [more] matters as a team. With the thought process that two minds are better than one, we believe that together we will more efficiently and effectively achieve meaningful progress on Student Council,” wrote Perkins in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “Clark and I plan to bring efficiency and meaningful discourse to Student Council. This year’s Co-Presidential job description encompasses a range of functions. We will not only liaise between students and administrators, but will also work with faculty and staff. Moreover, our role will be to represent the Academy at public events,” wrote Williams in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n Williams said the first item on their agenda will be rewriting the Student Council Constitution. Other plans in Perkins and William’s platform includes BluePrint, a wireless printing initiative, abolishing 8:00 p.m. sign-in for Uppers, athletics integration into the administrations office, an online club search and an online Textbook marketplace. \n “Before we actually begin tackling our platform ideas, we need to rewrite the Student Council Constitution. The review committee has worked extensively on establishing the new co-presidential model, but now we need to enact other structural changes,” wrote Williams. \n “The challenge will be to establish a sustainable, long-term structure. The co-presidential reform is only the first step; we need to redefine and restructure the roles of Class Representatives and cabinet positions. We need to establish definite and concrete mechanisms for student to administration discourse,” Williams continued. \n Perkins and Williams will decide on cabinet positions after rewriting the constitution. \n “We hope to create both clerical and communications positions. There are various tasks which will need to be accomplished, namely the recording of minutes, the managing of archives, the publication and codification of official Student Council opinions and the dissemination of Student Council documents and publications to the public,” wrote Perkins. \n Perkins wrote, “We look forward to working with Mr. Palfrey, Mrs. Sykes, Mr. Murphy and many others in a professional setting. Having real, meaningful discussions on policy and reform will bring us great joy.”\n Peale and Yi’s ideas included a later start time, a promotion of inter-cluster competition, longer library hours on Friday and Saturday, online votes on Paresky Commons food, the reinstallation of Andover Ask Forum and online grades and comments.\n “I hope [the co-presidency] works,” said Kaul. “I’m excited to see what Clark and Junius will do in the coming year. Im proud of all of the candidates, and very thankful to those who participated.Student Council is in good hands. I think that this election cycle has shown us how much students want to engage in these matters now and in the future.”\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAs mugs encrusted with food and week-old coffee continue to pile up in buildings across campus, leaders of the travel mug program decided to cease the use of collection bins in academic buildings on April 3. Students now have to drop their used mugs at Paresky Commons or the library. This change is intended to reinforce the idea of personal responsibility on campus, said Justin Wang ’13, co-founder of the travel mugs program, especially given the poor retention rate of mugs last term. Students often failed to return mugs to the collection bins at all, simply leaving them around campus, according to Christiana Nguyen ’13, another co-founder of the program. Cleanliness has been another ongoing problem with the mug program. Because students have been using mugs for food, e-leaders are concerned that foods like peanut butter and yogurt will cause allergic reactions, said Wang. As of now, the program is trying to regroup and generate feedback by attending student council meetings and talking to various teachers.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nOn March 4, the faculty voted 119 to 24 in favor of a new trial system to incorporate behavior evaluations into instructor comments. Starting in Fall Term of 2013, the school will report midterm and term grades on Parent Portal and PAnet. The report will require teachers to assess all students’ attitude, effort and performance with check-boxes and comments, according to John Rogers, Dean of Studies. Parents, students and faculty members will all be able to view the report. Rogers and the faculty hope the trial system will give all students more thorough feedback via the check-box system and allow for open communication between students and faculty. Under the current system, behavioral midterm comments are optional and are only sent out to students that require extra concern or receive a “failure” or “danger of failure” grade at midterm. Students who get behavior grades receive only “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory” on their report cards, which is unspecific, according to Rogers. The system will serve as a trial. Although the faculty initially wanted to test on a subset of students, they determined that testing the system with all students would be the most accurate way to determine effectiveness. If the program turns out to be unconstructive for students, another change may occur, said Rogers. According to Rogers, behavior grades have been used rarely and arbitrarily in the past. “It seemed better to get all faculty to comment positively, negatively or otherwise on every student’s behavior and effort,” said Rogers. “This is part of a broader effort to how we respond to kids and support kids. Every once in awhile, there is a situation where it would be really good to have more information earlier on a particular kid so we can do something at the midterm,” said Rogers. “[The new system] will hopefully allow us to intervene more quickly and more directly to help out a student that is struggling,” said Patrick Farrell, Chair of the Math Department and member of the multiple committees involved in the original proposal and implementation of the new system. “I think it’s providing information more comprehensively about every student. When a student has an advisor or coach that is working with that student in one area, they will know if the student is having trouble in other areas more easily,” said Rogers. The Student Alert System will also be modified with this new program. Also known as the “red flag” system, the Student Alert System allows teachers to “flag” students with serious concerns, regarding attendance, performance or well-being. After advisors are alerted using the Student Alert System, they can choose whether or not to notify each of the student’s instructors for updates and support. The new system focuses on specific academic patterns across the board, thus allowing issues to be addressed more quickly, according to Rogers. The space for comments allows both students and faculty alike to recognize problematic patterns and the need for improvement. When the faculty voted, Rogers said that the 24 who opposed the change valued the poignant message that the current system of behavior grades provides. Receiving an optional “unsatisfactory” grade is a message that clearly states that a student did not do what they were supposed to do. Brainstorming for the program initially started in the Access to Success Working Group, chaired by Linda Carter Griffith, Dean of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) and David Fox, Instructor in English. The discussion then continued in the Academic Council before being finalized by a small subgroup of Academic Council and Access to Success. Andover’s Technology Department is currently in the process of designing the new online system from scratch, said Rogers. This system is similar to the method already used by Summer Session, said Farrell. Fernando Alonso, Director of Summer Session, implemented a checkbox system that was received well by faculty. Farrell said that several people felt that the system that Fernando devised would work well during the school year as well.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nThis past Wednesday was “End of Tuition Day,” the day when tuition payments would theoretically run out if the budget relied solely on tuition for revenue for all 1,143 students at Andover. Andover’s Annual Fund, comprised of donations from alumni, current and past parents and the endowment, will support each student’s education for the rest of the year, said Head of School John Palfrey at the first All School Meeting of Spring Term. The cost to educate one student is $57,563, although the average tuition paid by all students is $42,000, wrote Jennifer Hout, Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs, in an e-mail to The Phillipian. On average students cover around 73 percent of their expenses, and the endowment covers $2,682 per student, according to Hout. This is due to the fact that the school is only allowed to draw between four to six percent from the endowment annually. The remaining $9,381 is paid through the Annual Fund, which serves Andover’s day-to-day budget. Paresky Commons baked a cake in honor of the celebration, and students signed thank you cards to the donors that make their Andover educations possible.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nDonning their pleated blue kilts for the first time, the new Blue Key Heads for the Class of 2014 raced through the Garver Room after the Class of 2013 Blue Key Heads formally announced their selections Tuesday evening.\n Unwana Abasi, Theo Agbi, Andries Feder, Pearson Goodman, Henry Kennelly, Rhea Lewis, Laz Nyamakazi, Chia Okorie, Steph Petrella and Becca Wagman, the Class of 2013 Blue Key Heads (BKH), officially passed down their skirts to Grant Bitler, Austin Gaiss, Kasey Hartung, Catherine Haseman, Cooper Hurley, Daniel Kim, Marjorie Kozloff, Stephanie Nekoroski, Adella Pierre and Matt Simon as the BKHs for the Class of 2014.\n This year, there were 36 applicants for BKH, the highest number of applicants in the past five years, according to Christopher Capano, Director of Student Activities and Advisor of the Blue Key Society.\n As in previous years, the process involved a written application as well as a live audition before an audience of students in Lower Right of Paresky Commons. Auditions included serenades, pushups and cheers with the goal of demonstrating their ability to get the crowds “a little bit rowdy.”\n “We were particularly looking for students who are not afraid to put themselves out there for the school. We want people who would not be afraid of screaming their lungs out at a game for the Big Blue,” said Nyamakazi.\n Some controversy arose after this year’s auditions in Paresky.\n “Overall, the auditions this year exceeded all expectations! Every applicant definitely gave this process their all, and demonstrated their love for Andover,” wrote Wagman in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n “On the other hand, this year’s auditions, especially the serenades, seemed to be more sexually oriented than in years past. I don’t know when or why this shift occurred, but being a BKH is about promoting PA and cheering on the Big Blue. Regardless, we could not be happier with our decisions, and we look forward to seeing BKH ‘14 rock those skirts like pros.” she continued.\n “It’s perfectly fine to go crazy for the Big Blue; I think BKH ’13 made that clear enough when we walked around campus bare legged during the winter. However, many of the auditions this year were over the top in a way that highlighted the applicants’ enjoyment of attention instead of the enjoyment they find in amplifying school spirit,” wrote Abasi in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n “Speaking with other students has made me realize that the pressure to take each audition farther might have willed some applicants to act in ways that crossed appropriate barriers. I understand that, but one job of a Blue Key Head is to appeal to grandparents, faculty children etc., in addition to high school Seniors. Finding a way to exemplify Big Blue Spirit in a manner that is PG-13 at the highest is definitely one of the keys to being a great Blue Key Head that was missing from many auditions,” she continued.\n Next year’s BKHs experienced varying levels of anxiety and nerves before their auditions, but all enjoyed the process overall.\n Pierre said, “The best part of auditioning was getting the support from everyone who was there. I wasn’t expecting to get such a wild response since the room was only half full when I entered lower right. I was expecting it to be hard to get everyone amped up, but everyone there was really into it.”\n “Though I felt well-prepared, as I had been practicing my serenade and the cheers repeatedly, I couldn’t quite shake the nerves. Fortunately, the moment I ran into [Paresky] Commons blowing my whistle and screaming my cheers, the nerves changed to adrenaline,” wrote Hasemen in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n Similarly, Hartung said that although she was a little nervous about her audition, the energy in Lower Right helped her to perform with confidence and vigor.\n “Other than playing sports, I really haven’t had many opportunities to do anything public, so this was a perfect opportunity to really show the other side, the true part of me. To put myself out there in front of the whole school was a huge step for me, and I am more than ready, more than excited to be a Blue Key Head,” she said. \n Hurley said that despite some nerves, he was not scared at all. “If I was scared, then I would not be in the position I am in now. I overcame it by thinking of where I wanted to be,” he wrote in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n Nekoroski’s nerves were more pronounced. “Seconds before I ran out in front of everyone, I was ready to sprint back to my car. I couldn’t believe I was going through with it, but I just closed my eyes and screamed. Somehow it worked, and I am still floating on cloud nine,” she said.\n Two former BKHs were in charge of each candidate’s audition. The candidates were asked unprepared interview questions. All the 2014 BKHs said that the questions asked by the former BKHs during their interview were difficult to answer.\n For Kozloff, the hardest part of the audition was when Henry Kennelly ’13, a former BKH, asked her to make him laugh. “I sat there in silence for at least ten seconds. Then I completely butchered a joke, and all I have to say is that he and Rhea were definitely not pleased,” she said.\n As a new Upper, Kim said that he was hesitant to try out at first because he felt that most people did not know the new Uppers, and he was still becoming familiar with the Andover community.\n “At first, the stigma of a new Upper did scare me. But then I remembered Pearson leading the cheers for Abbot during my orientation, and me gawking inside of my head, wondering, ‘Wow, this guy is unreal. Why can’t I be like him?’” Kim said. \n Bitler also wanted to become a BKH because the group helped him get rid of his worries about leaving home to attend a boarding school when he arrived at Andover as a new Lower.\n “What really changed my attitude about the whole transition [to Andover] were those crazy and loud students wearing blue skirts running down the chapel aisle at one of our orientation meetings. I want to make everyone else show the Big Blue Blood in their veins,” Bitler wrote in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n Gaiss said, “After experiencing roughly 73.6 percent of Upper year, I know how much of an emotional toll this school can have on some people at times, myself included. My major goal as a Blue Key Head is to make people happier and reduce this toll as much as possible. Whether this is through Valentine’s Day kisses or just cheering at games, I want to be there for the rest of the student body.”\n It is a tradition for the two BKHs who are conducting the interview to look as bored and intimidating as possible while the applicant performs his or her serenade and cheers.\n “Henry and Stephanie are incredibly nice in real life, but they can be incredibly scary when they want to be. It was hard to read what they were thinking and even harder to answer their questions, but I guess that just means they did their jobs well,” wrote Simon in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n BKHs organize and lead new student orientation, act as cheerleaders at all Andover home games and prepare the Fall and Winter Pep Rallies, according to Capano.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nAs the new Dean of Policy and Strategic Planning, Rachel Skiffer will join Andover at the start of the summer to help formulate the school’s Strategic Plan, which will provide framework for policies and direction in the years to come. Skiffer, current Director of Admissions and Financial Aid at San Francisco University High School, will help draft Andover’s new Strategic Plan and monitor its implementation on campus in the coming years, as well as oversee Andover’s institutional research programs. Strategic Plan acts as a framework for the school’s future policies by establishing specific goals over time. The institution of need-blind admissions in 2008, for example, was a part of the 2004 Strategic Plan, according the plan’s final report. Head of School John Palfrey created the position in order to help guide the school in his relatively new tenure. “This position is essential as we chart the future of the Academy, through our strategic planning process, which will run from the end of this academic year through the next year, and beyond,” wrote Palfrey in an e-mail to The Phillipian. Skiffer’s primary role, she said, will be to work with a variety of members of the Andover community to create a plan that serves the entire community’s interests. “To start, I will be asking, listening and learning—getting to know PA from the folks who know it best. That will enable me to facilitate a strategic planning process that is inclusive, engaging, innovative, sensible and clear,” wrote Skiffer. “The plan’s direction is driven by our constituencies, not by me. It’s about talking to faculty, staff, students, trustees and alumni. It’s a time for Andover to reflect and figure out in which direction we want the school to go,” she continued. Skiffer will also expand on the existing Strategic Plan, which was created in 2004 and delineates Andover’s official ideological direction, along with the policies necessary to carry out the plan. “Youth from every quarter” is the primary focus of the 2004 Plan, which aimed to encourage diversity of perspectives and talents in the student body and the faculty. In order to facilitate Skiffer’s leadership of Andover’s institutional research program, Andover will also hire a Director of Institutional Research, who will report to Skiffer, wrote Palfrey. “[Institutional Research] is an ongoing process to understand what the Andover education really means and what we accomplish through our work with students,” wrote Palfrey. Current research programs include “The End Depends Upon the Beginning: Study of Ninth Grade Transition,” “Parent Satisfaction Surveys” and the “Access to Success Senior Survey,” all of which aim to “expand understanding of current students’ levels of success, to study the effectiveness of new programs and to measure the ‘value added’ of an Andover education,” according to the 2004 Strategic Plan final report. Skiffer’s appointment was not the result of a direct application, but instead the strong recommendations of the students and faculty she met with during her visit to Andover when she was interviewing for the Dean of Admission position in December. “Many colleagues and students wrote notes to me to the effect that ‘we should somehow try to convince Rachel to join us at PA,’” wrote Palfrey in an e-mail update sent to parents. Skiffer grew up in San Francisco, California and is a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School. Skiffer’s has previously worked as an admissions and financial aid officer at Harvard University and the Latin School in Chicago, according to her biography on the Katherine Delmar Burke School website. She has also worked as a management consultant at McKinsey and Company in Los Angeles and New York City, as well as a commercial real estate lawyer in San Francisco, according to the Andover press release.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nWhile most students readjusted the routine of classes last week, John French ’13 and Farris Peale ’14 instead traveled to Durban, South Africa to compete with the world’s top high school debaters for an international title at the 2013 World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championship (WIDPSC) where French placed 18th and Peale placed 32nd. French, Director of Training for the Philomathean Society (Philo), and Peale, an associate of Philo, each competed in four events: parliamentary debate, impromptu speaking, interpretative reading of prose or a play and either persuasive speaking or “after-dinner” speaking, which involves using humor to make an argument. The world champion was determined through the cumulative scores in each event. Formulating speeches on “baby steps,” “don’t cry over spilled milk” and “keep your eye on the ball” with only two minutes to prepare, French placed into the third and final round of impromptu speaking. He was also two points away from making the finals for interpretive reading. Peale’s speech about geographic education earned her a spot on the final round for persuasive speaking. Although neither French nor Peale qualified as finalists in parliamentary debate, which is Philo’s primary form, Peale did place in the top 15 debaters overall, only one-sixth of a point away from finals. Only the top 12 contestants competed in the final round of parliamentary debate. “I was one-sixth of a point away from making it to the finals for debate… I was just so close, but I’m trying not to be that disappointed about it [because] maybe next year I’ll be able to make it,” said Peale. French and Peale travelled as part of the 15-member United States national team. They competed against students from Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, the United States, England, South Africa, Lithuania, Pakistan, Cyprus, Argentina, Botswana, Israel, India, South Korea, Zimbabwe and Germany, according to the WIDPSC website. Both French and Peale said that their favorite part about the competition was the opportunity to talk to and mingle with kids from all over the world. Each participant competed in two of four rounds of parliamentary debate as a pair with another individual from a different country, said Peale. “I really enjoyed debating and meeting all these kids from different countries, and especially because all of us shared the same interest. I think we bonded more quickly,” said Peale. French debated about government aid for healthcare, while Peale debated the subject of negotiation with terrorists. Both students also debated about a strong dictatorship versus a weak democracy. Despite the opportunity to collaborate with students from other countries, French experienced some difficulties in style and formality discrepancies among the international judges that caused him point deductions. French had points marked down by one of the judges when he declined to answer his opponent’s point of information. However, the judges did not mark down the opponent for declining all four of French’s points of information. “What is considered to be rude and unacceptable is different, it seemed like, depending on where you are from,” French said. “One of the judges marked me down as rude for ignoring a girl’s point of information. Apparently in some countries it is okay for girls to say no to guys but not the other way around,” continued French. “I didn’t really know what to expect going into the competition, and although I do wish I made the final round for debate and interpretive reading, I really can’t complain because I had a great time,” said French. Despite the lack of a formal coach in Philo, which is completely student-run, Peale said she believes both she and French did very well. “It was a really solid competition, especially because most of the teams there had qualified somehow to get to Worlds. There were some really skilled debaters from all parts of the world, and in all it was just a fun experience,” said Peale. French qualified to participate in WIDPSC by placing first in the Roxbury Latin Invitational Tournament in September. Peale qualified by cinching first place in the Stoneleigh-Burnham School Public Speaking Competition, according to previous articles in The Phillipian. The participants of WIDPSC were given time to explore and enjoy South Africa after three days of intense competition that began on March 30. “[South Africa] was warm, which was really nice, especially coming from Andover. We were also right on the coast, so we went to the beach and the waterpark to hang out. It was really nice to just relax and chill after the competition in such a beautiful country,” French said. They also visited Mahatma Gandhi’s former Durban residence and the place where Nelson Mandela cast his first democratic vote, according to Peale.

Only the second floor servery will be open on Saturdays and Sunday Brunch for the remainder of the academic year. Lower Left will also remain open during brunch according to Senior Director of Paresky Dining Paul Robarge. This change was made after a discussion with Paresky’s managers, culinary team and Robarge. “Part of the benefit of the renovation to Paresky Commons [in 2009] is the flexibility to use the space in a creative and potentially more efficient manner,” said Robarge. The change to Paresky’s weekend layout will allow for Paresky to staff and service weekend meals more efficiently, according to Robarge. This recent switch to second floor service on weekends is part of Paresky’s goal in moving forward in creating a better dining program. “The only way we will be capable of doing so is to make small operational changes that have very little impact to the overall quality and variety of menu options currently being served,” said Robarge.\n\n', 'Apr 11, 2013'), ('\nThree alumni are currently in the preliminary stages of organizing the first ever Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Andover alumni committee and support network this spring.

What’s remarkable for me was that when I came out there was a big athlete, like such a high school there were nerds and jocks, and actually, after making my statement, everybody stood up and I got a standing ovation, and the jock also stood up.\n\xa0\n**Had you planned this?**\nAt the time, I wasn’t already planning to come out, but we had already had the GSA meeting at the time.\n\xa0\n**Who were the other starting members of GSA?**\n[Jay] Rogers [former Instructor in History] actually in class when he was giving out the history papers—this was before I had come out to him—suggested that one of the topics that you could write on was to write about the development of the Gay Liberation movement, and that’s when I went to him and said that I would like to write about thank [I think] he sort of knew [that I was gay] and that’s why he said it in class, and then in the process he became one of the faculty advisors to GSA. There were three of us: Jennifer Thompson and Lisa Delgado.\n\xa0\n**Why did you start it?**\nWe were very involved in AIDS awareness at the time because it was the height of the AIDS epidemic, and we were interested in making sure that students were aware of gay sex and we used that also with awareness of homophobia. The school was in the process of designing their policy on AIDS when I graduated. AIDS was one of our topics in GSA, I’m sure the administration was already involved in doing that, but we had gone to meetings in boston, and we had information about it, and also ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was starting at that time. I think that was the year that they had the AIDS quilts, which was very powerful throughout the country, people made quilts for people who died [of AIDS].\n\xa0\n**What was the greatest challenge you had to overcome to start GSA? Any blowback from it?**\nI would say the biggest challenge was when I was alone in the dorms or in the locker room, I remember getting harassed when I would be walking across campus, I was also a dancer at the time, so my friends and I would break out in dances all over campus, which would provoke a reaction, but the thing that was the hardest for me was when I was in the dorm, and I remember that was what I found the most stressful.\n\xa0\n**What aspect of the dorm environment do you think contributed to this?**\nThe real issue was that the faculty had awareness around this, I remember talking to someone in Graham House, and the faculty were very supportive, and then I’d go the the dorm, and it would be awkward with the guys in the dorm, and in particular with my roommate, and so they organized a dorm meeting to raise awareness around it, and things did get better then. I think it helped to some extent because we talked about it, but it didn’t help with me and my roommate because my roommate was just very uncomfortable, so I ended up moving to a single, which I was fine with.\n\xa0\n**How did this compare with the rest of the country at the time?**\nAndover was definitely a safer community to be in that outside of Andover, I was an activist at the time, and you know basically being at Andover made it so much easier for me than if I had gone to North Andover High School, for example.\n**Do you believe the country’s attitude has changed?**\nYes. Well even in my own life, when I came out my brother was horrified, and my mom said I would go to hell, and I had a really hard time with my family around it because they were Catholic, but my father was also concern with race, and I had friends of all different races at andover, but my family was quite racist growing up and they talked about how my friends at Andover were not typical. Since then so much has changed in my family, they’re much more comfortable with talking about race or having people of different races in their lives, and they’re also more comfortable with gay people or with me. So much has changed, even though my family is Catholic, that’s really not an issue anymore.\n\xa0\n**How did Andover affect how you saw yourself as an LGBT individual?**\nHere’s the thing, so Mr. Rogers told us to think of the history class as our history and not as if we were passive participants, and Mr. Rogers had been very active in the black civil rights movement, and that’s how he encouraged me to see my role as a gay person, say this is my history, and I needed to do something because I wanted to do something that created space for me. So I had a very opportunistic experience compared to the other people that you would talk to. It’s not that things were perfect, but you know I was on the gymnastics team and none of the people on the team I remember having an issue with, maybe they would make jokes but it really wasn’t mean-spirited, and I was already out when I was chosen as the captain of the team. I also was out when I was chosen to be the president of the debate society, and nobody cared that I was gay.\n\n', 'Apr 5, 2013'), ('\n\n\n', 'Apr 5, 2013'), ('\nIn memory of Paul Monette ’63, a gay rights activist and writer, the Addison Gallery will feature “Secrets, Loss, Memory, and Courage: Works by Gay Male Artists,” an exhibit set to open on April 27 at Andover, according to the Addison website.\nThe exhibit will be curated from the Addison’s permanent collections, which have only recently been expanded to include a greater variety of gay male artists with the donation by the class of 1963 at its 50th reunion, according to Brian Allen, Director of the Addison. The donations were made in memory of Monette, who passed away at the age of 49 in 1995 due to complications from AIDS, according to the “New York Times.” Monette wrote “Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story,” a National Book Award-winning memoir detailing his struggle with his sexual orientation at Andover and for much of his life, according to the “New York Times.”\n“Most of the art is from the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s.

Nine percent of the surveyed students were against it.\nAccording to a March 26 poll by CBS News, 53 percent of Americans believe that gay couples should be able to get married. 39 percent of Americans say gay marriage should not be legal.\nWhen evaluated by region, students from the Northeastern United States were most supportive of gay marriage. 91.1 percent of the 371 students from the Northeast indicated that they were in favor of gay marriage.\nStudents from the Southeastern United States were slightly less supportive of gay marriage, with 87.8 percent of 36 respondents in favor of LGBTQ rights to be recognized as married under the law. Approximately 43.5 percent of the surveyed students identified themselves with the upper middle socioeconomic class. 24.1 percent identified themselves with the upper class and 22.0 percent with the middle class. Respondents in the upper middle class were by far the most supportive of gay marriage, with 94.4 percent in favor.\nIn contrast, 87.1 percent of the respondents in the upper class were in favor, representing the group least supportive of gay marriage. “Moral reasons,” followed by “constitutionality” and “family/personal reasons” were the most common factors influencing students opinions. Additionally, when asked how the people in their households felt about the issue 56.2 percent of respondents reported that their entire families shared the same opinions about the subject.\n201 students identified as Democrats, the most represented affiliation, in the survey and 98 percent of them were in favor of LGBTQ marriage. The next most represented political affiliations were Undecided and Independent, polling 97.8 percent in favor and 94.5 percent in favor, respectively. Republicans were represented by 100 students, of which 68 percent were in favor. Sixteen students identified as “Other” for political affiliation, and 93.8 percent of them were in support of LGBTQ marriage.\nHowever, respondents views may have been influenced by hometown sentiment, as from the respondents from the Northeastern United States, 50.1 percent described their hometowns as “accepting” of LGBTQ youth. Similarly, Northwestern hometowns were reported as most supportive, with 40 percent described as “very accepting.” In the Southeastern U.S., hometowns were equally described as accepting, unaccepting, and very unaccepting of LGBTQ+ youth at 24.4 percent each. The remaining 24.4 percent of applicants did not know how to describe their hometown’s sentiment.\nOut of 31 respondents who identified as gay, 18 said that Andover is a safe place for LGBTQ students, but that there is still some discrimination. 14 out of the 31 respondents who identified as bisexual said that Andover was a very safe place for LGBTQ students, and 15 said that it was safe, but that there is still some discrimination.

Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, Temba Maqubela, Dean of Faculty, and John Rogers, Dean of Studies, scrambled last spring to manage class sizes and find additional housing and classroom space for the 38 additional enrollments. \n Ventre attributed the lower admittance rate to the new electronic admission application and online reading system, which allowed faculty members easier access to admission applications, as before this year, they had to walk to Shuman Admissions Office to read applications. As the faculty had unlimited access to the electronic applications, they were able to more rigorously assess the candidates, according to Ventre.\n In addition, the paperless application allowed the Admission team to assess the strength of an individual applicant earlier, sometimes even before the application was completed. \n “As a result of the electronic submission of application materials, we were able to assess general admission criteria earlier. Subsequently, we advised a higher percentage of students not to complete their application this year and to consider other options. The effort was purposeful and helpful so that we did not drive applications higher and thereby further lower the admit rate. With a lower and lower admit rate, non-traditional boarding school families begin to wonder who gets admitted and that runs counter culture to our effort to recruit youth from every quarter,” wrote Ventre.\n Ventre also explained that changes in the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT) content and scoring resulted in lower-than-expected test results for many students, so these students may have withdrawn their applications or decided not to apply to Andover.\n “Throughout the fall and winter, Team Shuman has fielded numerous calls from feeder schools and families who are concerned about lower-than-expected test results. Most importantly, it is clear that some families are electing not to apply to Andover simply based on test scores that they perceive to be ‘below the bar’ for admission. When we have engaged families who call to withdraw their applications or cancel their interview appointments, we have learned that they are opting to do so for exactly because of SSAT results,” wrote Ventre.\n The Admissions Office awarded the total amount of $5,515,330 in financial aid to 148 students, according to the website.\n Next year, 47 percent of the student body is projected to be on scholarship, with 13 percent on full scholarship, according to the Andover website.\n Fifty-two percent of the admitted students identify as White or Caucasian. 24 percent identify as Asian, Asian American or Biracial Asian. 16 percent identify as Native American, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino or Biracial, according to the Andover website.\n These percentages represent a slight increase from last year, according to Ventre, because the Admission Office admitted approximately the same number of underrepresented students of color as last year despite the decrease in total number of admitted students. \n This admitted pool also represents a 200 percent increase of admitted students from South Dakota and Kentucky, a 300 percent increase of students from Arizona, and a 100 percent increase of admitted students from Albania, Dominica and Syria. The admission team also admitted several students from unusual places such as Bermuda, Kazakhstan, Syria and Morocco due to expanded recruitment efforts, according to Ventre.\n\n', 'Apr 4, 2013'), ('\nAs students headed home on March 14, Head of School John Palfrey was one of the first to make a purchase at the new storefront of Parents of Students at Phillips Academy (PSPA) during the official ribbon-cutting ceremony. The store is located to the right of the Evans-DeFelice Theatre Classroom in George Washington Hall where the vending machines previously were. In addition to serving as a storefront, PSPA will use the new space to store merchandise. “Prior to this we were storing all the merchandise in the basement of Bartlet Hall, which was wet, and crowded and inconvenient, so this makes it much easier to access and easier for us to manage it, and gives it more visibility,” said Susan Howell, PSPA President. Howell hopes that its new store will increase its merchandise sales, which will be used to fund student activities. PSPA gives approximately $25,000 to fund student-run clubs, community service projects and the office of Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD), among other initiatives. Construction and design began over Winter Break, and PSPA paid for the project with its own profits, said Howell. “We have not had a store here, so we had to think about what the implications would be, of putting something in and having it here, but they clearly have made the most of this space. It’s phenomenal,” said Becky Sykes, Associate Head of School, who also served as an administrative contact for PSPA. “In the past it’s always been merchandise on tables and trying to fish through bins for people to look at what we had. We wanted to make it visually pleasing, but also easy for shopping, like a regular store,” said Laurie Fraser, Merchandise Director. Fraser and Pam Roche were the main coordinators of the design of the store. “[Roche] has a merchandising background, and in terms of visually designing the space, we were able to draw on her expertise,” said Howell. Currently, the store is scheduled to be open on special occasions, beginning with accepted-student revisit days and Grandparents Weekend this Spring. Currently, the store is staffed entirely by PSPA volunteers. “We’re hoping that the students respond to the space and ask for the space to be open more and show the support, so that we can get multiple days during the week,” said Roche. “Hopefully we can get students involved [in] work-duty jobs similar to those in central services. There are opportunities for kids to come and work with one of the PSPA volunteers,” said Fraser. PSPA hopes that the store’s services will evolve according to the needs of the students and will eventually offer students opportunities to get involved. Fraser said a possible idea to accomplish this is an on-campus design contest for a new Andover t-shirt or sweatshirt. “As parents, we all think we know what merchandise [the students] want, but it’s more important to hear what [the students] think,” said Fraser. “We don’t even have a name for the store yet, so we’re thinking of having a naming contest,” said Tina Kinard, who will be the PSPA President next year.\n\n', 'Apr 4, 2013'), ('\nHead of School John Palfrey’s advice for finals? “This too shall pass,” he said to the 608 followers of the Faces of Andover (FOA) page. Faces of Andover, a project started by Alex Westfall ’15 and Rani Iyer ’15. has garnered over one hundred likes on each of the five photos posted since its March 8 launch. \n Iyer and Westfall were inspired by Brandon Stanton’s project, Humans of New York (HONY) started in 2010 as a photographic census of New York City, which later evolved into a blog capturing the lives and emotions of New Yorkers along with captions consisting of either quotes from the subjects, or descriptions by Stanton himself, according to the HONY website.\n “One day, Rani and I were walking downtown, and we passed by this woman who seemed to catch our eyes. After this, Rani pointed out that I should start a photo project like Humans of New York. So that’s how the project was put into action,” said Westfall\n “We wanted to have the project embody Phillips Academy, just how Stanton’s project did so with “Humans of New York”, so that’s why we named it Faces of Andover,” she added.\n According to Iyer, the pair plans on taking photos of everyday actions and moments on campus with corresponding quotes from the subjects and descriptions. These photos will then be posted on FOA’s Facebook page every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n “A large part of the project is capturing the best moments on campus, people-like moments and what makes Andover ‘Andover’ to all of us,” said Iyer\n The founders have contacted the subjects of some photos in advance, but plan to shift the focus to candid photos this term. Four of the five photos posted thus far have been pre-arranged.\n Westfall and Iyer have thus far attempted to choose subjects that they feel represent Andover as a whole. “That’s why we’ve had people like Mr. Palfrey and Graydon [Tope ’14] and Parker Tope [’16], who are adorable and really nice people. We’re not only trying to get the big faces of campus, but also the general community of Andover,” Iyer said.\n The page initially launched on March 2, but remained inactive until its first upload of Palfrey on March 8.\n “Rani and I just put out the description and project’s information on the page that day, so before we even posted our first photo, we already had around 300 likes,” said Westfall.\n The founders have enlisted “promoters” from each class to invite people to “like” the page on Facebook. Iyer said that alumni and faculty members have also found out about FOA and have begun to publicize the project on their own.\n Westfall added that the two may enlist more people if the project grows much larger, though they have no concrete plans for expansion.\n “We were really surprised as to the response that came out of the project. Every picture has gotten well over 100 likes within half an hour. One day, I posted something at 9:45 in the library, and then came back to the dorm 10 minutes later to find that the photo had 60 likes,” said Iyer\n “People have also approached us in person telling us how wonderful our project is and how it truly represents Andover’s community. It’s really just been overwhelming,” added Westfall.\n As of now, the project plans on continuing for as long as Iyer and Westfall are at Andover.\n “As long as the project doesn’t fizzle out and we have enough support, we plan to run it until we graduate,” said Westfall.\n\n', 'Apr 4, 2013'), ('\nDrawing from her experience teaching an interdepartmental bioethics elective course at Andover, Christine Marshall-Walker, Instructor in Biology, published an article titled “Raising the Next Generation: Bioethical Education for a Post-Genomic Age” in National Association of Independent Schools’ (NAIS) Winter 2013 issue of Independent School Magazine. Her article discusses how to effectively integrate bioethical discussions into preexisting biology and philosophy curriculums.\n The article addresses the incorporation of classroom discussion on advancements in reproductive technologies and genetic mapping of embryos and fetuses, as these technologies greatly affect the way potential parents think about pregnancy and the idea of starting a family, according to Marshall-Walker.\n Testing such as imaging and detection for issues in embryos and fetuses often bring about a set of moral questions for modern parents, according to Marshall-Walker.\n “For example, if it is shown through testing that an embryo or fetus is not developing normally like it should, should the parents terminate the pregnancy? People have already, and will continue to face these kinds of moral questions,” she said. \n Marshall-Walker believes that a collaborative effort between teachers and parents, including an in-depth bioethical education at school, will equip young adults with skills necessary to handle the moral dilemmas that accompany today’s rapid advancement in technology. She also hopes to address an increasing need for teachers to incorporate the subject in existing core curricula.\n “I feel that many biology teachers are starting to become motivated and wanting to teach this type of moral inquiry embedded in a more traditional biology course, but they have a lot of questions as to how it would work,” said Marshall-Walker.\n “How you can structure the course? How to incorporate it into pre-existing curriculums smoothly? It seemed to me that these kinds of questions were up in the air. So I thought that there needs to be at least a little bit of sharing of what I’ve learned from running this elective course here at Andover,” she continued.\n Marshall-Walker drew on her experience teaching an interdisciplinary elective course on bioethics called “Humanities in the Post-Genomic Era” with Vincent Avery, a former instructor in Religion-Philosophy. The interdisciplinary course examines biological issues that challenge the current understanding of humanity and provides a brief introduction to ethics and philosophical anthropology and their roles in setting public policy, according to the Andover course catalog.\n “Every individual has a different take on various moral questions we address throughout the course, and they are asked to form a philosophical stance using biology as a tool to support their claim [and] make the opinions more grounded,” said Marshall-Walker.\n Marshall-Walker and Avery received a grant to work over the summer to design the elective together in 2009, and Marshall-Walker worked as a visiting scholar at the Hastings Center in Bioethics during the summer of 2010 to further develop the course. They first taught the course during Winter Term in 2011.\n Prior to teaching at Andover, Marshall-Walker was a developmental neuroscientist, working for a postdoctoral research fellowship at Harvard Medical School for five years after obtaining her doctorate at Columbia University on neurobiology.\n During her medical education, she studied the development of the brain and examined how different parts of the brain take shape to serve specific functions at different stages of pregnancy.\n As she learned more about the process of brain development in fetuses and tests during the first and second trimesters to detect genetic abnormalities, Marshall-Walker became curious and concerned about the moral dilemmas that accompany the advancement in technology.\n “I think it’s a natural progression for developmental biologists to start thinking about ethical questions, and most do come to a point when they become more interested in the philosophical questions,” she said. \n Marshall-Walker started working on the article in 2010 as a scholar in residence at The Hastings Center, a nonpartisan bioethics research center. She had originally intended it to be specifically for the bioethics community, but as she taught the elective course at Andover, she decided to concentrate on the educational aspect of bioethics.\n This was Marshall-Walker’s first published research paper on education and bioethics, but she has written numerous papers on developmental neuroscience while working as a researcher.\n In the future, Marshall-Walker said she hopes to collaborate with Avery Publishing Group on a book that will provide guidelines on bioethics and family ethics for couples thinking of starting a new family.\n\n', 'Apr 4, 2013'), ('\nScott Hoenig, Instructor in Mathematics, will succeed Kate Dolan as Assistant Dean of Advising beginning this summer. \n Dolan will assume her new position as West Quad South (WQS) Cluster Dean next fall.\n John Rogers, Dean of Studies, and Trish Russell, incoming Dean of Studies, made the final decision to appoint Hoenig to the position, according to Hoenig.\n The Assistant Dean of Advising oversees Andover’s advising program and serves as a liaison to other offices on campus, such as the Admission Office, College Counseling Office and department chairs, on matters relating to advising. Hoenig will also chair the Advising Council, which grants approval to students wishing to take either four or six classes and oversees the Abbot Independent Scholars Program, according to Hoenig. \n “Mr. Hoenig has years of experience working with students in many capacities, including teaching, advising, house counseling and coaching. He is an organized, thoughtful, diligent educator who will bring these qualities to bear in this role as he has in all of his other roles on campus. He has earned the respect of his students and his colleagues and will have their trust in overseeing this important program,” wrote Rogers in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n The position was open to all returning faculty members and Hoenig was one of four who applied for the position. Assistant Dean for Advising rotates every six years.\n According to Hoenig, he submitted his interest through e-mail, and then was invited for interviews with Rodgers and Russell, as well as members of the Dean of Studies office, such as Deborah Olander, Scheduling Officer, Cynthia Stewart, Office Manager, and Anne Burgess, Assistant Registrar. \n Hoenig said he applied because it was the perfect opportunity for him to get involved in new areas of the school. \n “I am most looking forward to getting to know the school in a different way, interacting with colleagues in new ways, and also being involved in new areas of the school which I am not currently involved in. I am excited to not only learn about, but also work with various different offices on campus,” said Hoenig.\n Although he does not have specific plans to restructure the current system of advising, the strategic planning process that the school will complete next year, may spark discussion about changes to the advising system in the future, according to Hoenig.\n “Most of my ideas have to do with trying to figure out what advisors want or what advisors think would be beneficial to them completing their job. I want to learn how to gather that information, and how I can help support the advisors,” he continued.\n Hoenig said he hopes to continue to support advisors and also to adapt the job as technology and times change. He hopes to make it easier for advisors to do their job well.\n According to Hoenig, Dolan helped implement the electronic advising system which allows advisors to submit student course selection forms online.\n “Ms. Dolan has been great about not only creating connections between her office and the other offices on campus, but also being a mentor, guide and resource to the advisors. I would love to be able to do the job as well as she has done,” Hoenig added.\n Hoenig began his career at Andover in 1998 as a teaching fellow. Aside from a two-year stint earning a master’s degree in mathematics from Boston University, he has been teaching and coaching at Andover since. \n Currently, Hoenig teaches math, is Head Coach of the Varsity Ultimate team, oversees the JV Ultimate program, is Coach of the JV Water Polo team and is a House Counselor and academic advisor to Junior boys in Rockwell North.\n According to Hoenig, the role of Assistant Dean of Advising will replace two of his current math classes, so he will only be teaching one math class. Aside from that, Hoenig will maintain all of his other responsibilities on campus.\n Hoenig has also been on the House Counselor Committee for approximately 10 years, has served on the Athletic Council, and currently is the Junior House Counselor coordinator.\n\n', 'Apr 4, 2013'), ('\nPatrick Farrell, Instructor and Chair in Mathematics, will become the next Dean of Faculty on July 1, succeeding Temba Maqubela, who will assume his new position as Headmaster at The Groton School at the end of this school year.\n Head of School John Palfrey announced his selection to the community on Tuesday, March 12.\n “[Farrell] has done every aspect of the work of a teacher here at Andover, as a coach, dorm head, classroom teacher and department chair.

They hope to make the decision early in Spring Term, said Farrell.\n Farrell has not developed any concrete plans for changes in the Dean of Faculty Office yet.\n “Where I am right now, taking on a position like this, is a little bit like a mechanic trying to diagnose a car before he’s picked up the hood and looked at the engine. So what I’ve learned in being Math Department Chair is that many times a view that you had from the other side of the desk changes when you get to this side of the desk,” said Farrell.\n He does, however, hope to work with department heads to implement hiring policies used in the Math Department. Currently, when math teaching fellows and full-time candidates visit, they are put in a class where students are doing group work to see how the candidates interact with the students.\n “You get a much more honest feel for how that person is. That’s what we really want. We want to see what the genuine person is like and to get them to step out of that interview mode and into the ‘I wonder how I am going to handle this’ [mode],” said Farrell.\n Farrell hopes to work with the department chairs to ensure that these types of interactions factor into all hiring decisions.\n Currently, Farrell teaches two sections of Math 590 and is Department Chair in Mathematics, in addition to coaching track and working as a House Counselor in Johnson.\n After eight years of co-house counseling, Farrell and his wife, Karen Farrell, will move out of their home in Johnson Hall at the end of this year. Farrell, however, plans to continue to interact with students as much as possible.\n “I enjoy [the contact that I have with students] immensely… I will keep up teaching at least one course during my first year, and I hope to be teaching maybe two sections after I get more knowledge on the job. I would like to continue to be around on Wednesday nights for math team practices and as much as possible try to stay connected with the students because in making decisions and evaluating faculty and hiring new faculty, the students are always going to be first in my mind,” said Farrell.\n As Dean of Faculty, Maqubela helped found programs such as the Accelerate, Challenge, Enrich (ACE) summer program in Colorado, and the BASK in ASK program that will launch this summer in China.\n After working this year with Allen Scheier, Visiting Scholar in Mathematics from Lawrence High School, and focusing on issues of “access to success,” Farrell would like to continue the connection between Andover and Lawrence, possibly through a teacher exchange.\n “I will say that I have a great deal of interest in math and science education in urban areas. If we leave out students [from math and science education] in struggling schools in urban areas and also in rural high schools where they might not have the same opportunities in math and science, we’re basically losing out on a significant portion of our talent in those areas, and I don’t think that as a nation we can any longer afford to do that,” said Farrell.\n The position was open to all faculty members as well as outside candidates. Candidates were nominated by themselves or by other faculty members.\n After meeting with all of the nominees, Palfrey narrowed the applicant pool down to six finalists.

During the tenure of former Head of School Barbara Chase, the Dean of Studies reported to the Dean of Faculty.\nAccording to a previous Phillipian article, Chase changed the reporting structure because she realized it would be difficult to manage the day-to-day academic program and travel extensively.\nFarrell and Trish Russell, incoming Dean of Studies, will work together to appoint a new math department chair with the guidance of Maqubela and John Rogers, current Dean of Studies. They hope to make the decision early in Spring Term, said Farrell.\nFarrell has not developed any concrete plans for changes in the Dean of Faculty Office yet.\n“Where I am right now, taking on a position like this, is a little bit like a mechanic trying to diagnose a car before he’s picked up the hood and looked at the engine. So what I’ve learned in being Math Department Chair is that many times a view that you had from the other side of the desk changes when you get to this side of the desk,” said Farrell.\nHe does, however, hope to work with department heads to implement hiring policies used in the Math Department. Currently, when math teaching fellows and full-time candidates visit, they are put in a class where students are doing group work to see how the candidates interact with the students.\n“You get a much more honest feel for how that person is. That’s what we really want. We want to see what the genuine person is like and to get them to step out of that interview mode and into the ‘I wonder how I am going to handle this’ [mode],” said Farrell.\nFarrell hopes to work with the department chairs to ensure that these types of interactions factor into all hiring decisions.\nCurrently, Farrell teaches two sections of Math 590 and is Chair in Mathematics, in addition to coaching track and working as a House Counselor in Johnson.\nAfter eight years of co-house counseling, Farrell and his wife, Karen Farrell, will move out of their home in Johnson Hall at the end of this year. Farrell, however, plans to continue to interact with students as much as possible.\n“I enjoy [the contact that I have with students] immensely. . . I will keep up teaching at least one course during my first year and I hope to be teaching maybe two sections after I get more knowledge on the job. I would like to continue to be around on Wednesday nights for math team practices and as much as possible try to stay connected with the students because in making decisions and evaluating faculty and hiring new faculty, the students are always going to be first in my mind,” said Farrell.\nAs Dean of Faculty, Maqubela helped found programs such as the Accelerate, Challenge, Enrich (ACE) summer program in Colorado, and the BASK in ASK program that will launch this summer in China.\nAfter working this year with Allen Scheier, Visiting Scholar in Mathematics from Lawrence High School, and focusing on issues of “access to success,” Farrell would like to continue the connection between Andover and Lawrence, possibly through a teacher exchange.\n“I will say that I have a great deal of interest in math and science education in urban areas. If we leave out students [from math and science education] in struggling schools in urban areas and also in rural high schools where they might not have the same opportunities in math and science, we’re basically losing out on a significant portion of our talent in those areas, and I don’t think that as a nation we can any longer afford to do that,” said Farrell.\nThe position was open to all faculty members as well as outside candidates. Candidates were nominated by themselves or by other faculty members.\nAfter meeting with all of the nominees, Palfrey narrowed the applicant pool down to six finalists. Each of the six finalists wrote a statement which, along with their resume, was posted online for faculty to review and give input. Palfrey interviewed the six candidates twice and chose Farrell from the final pool.\n_Correction:\xa0Patrick Farrell was incorrectly referred to as Peter Farrel.

On Tuesday night, Rachel Murree ’14, Jerry Li ’14 and Djavaneh Bierwirth ’14 launched a trial version of a new Facebook page, APS, for 24 hours. The students hope to launch the full version in the spring. The group hopes to operate the page from 8:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on school nights and work with the Academic Skills Center (ASC) to have peer tutors online to help students with homework questions in math and science courses, according to Murree. “We just want to make life easier for these students and help foster a ‘Connected Andover,’” said Murree. As of now, the project is limited to the Chemistry 250 and 300 classes as well as the Physics 270 and 400 classes. Tuesday’s launch, according to Bierwirth, was intended to gauge student reaction to the program and get feedback before they begin planning the full page. The group plans to meet with Math and Science department heads to get their input on the program as well.\n### Gelb Science Center: Physics 530 Class Publishes Paper\nAfter weeks of stargazing in Gelb Observatory, Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics and supervisor of the Andover Observatory, led her Physics 530 class to determine the rotation period of an asteroid. The class is now submitting their result to be published in the scientific journal “Minor Planet Bulletin.” The class worked on this project for the first several weeks of Winter Term, measuring images gathered using the telescope in Gelb Observatory to collect data. Members of the class then used a software called MPO Canopus to determine a graph that plots brightness levels of the asteroid in the images. They used the period of the graphs to determine the time it takes for the asteroid to make a full rotation. Pairs of two in the class each produced their own light curve. Emily Carrolo ’13 and Gabriel Freund ’13 produced the curve that the article was based on. Claire Carroll ’14 wrote the final paper that was submitted on behalf of the whole class. Physics 530 is a new, term-contained research astronomy course for advanced science students.\n### Community Service Scholar: Harrison ’13 Examines Poverty and Hunger\nIn her two-part Community Service Scholar presentation, Anna Harrison ’13 hosted a game simulating the daily life of a person unable to afford three meals a day on Monday and invited Melissa Dussek, the Representative of the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) to speak on Tuesday.\nFor the game, each student was assigned a family income profile, detailing expenses per month. allowing them to calculate the amount of money left for food per day. With the money left over, students struggled to afford full meals totaling 2,000 calories per day. Of the 10 students involved in the simulation, nine players were food insecure while one was a wealthy student, who earned more than enough per month to pay for food, private school, utilities and a mortgage. “I thought it would be really interesting for the people here to see because I grew up in a community that was not very wealthy at all, and I saw poverty and hunger on a daily basis, but when I tell people about my experiences here, they don’t seem to understand the situation as much,” said Harrison.\nDussek shared her optimism about eradicating poverty and hunger in the United States through the GBFB. The GBFB is a charitable business that solicits donations to be distributed at local food pantries, community meal programs, homeless shelters and senior centers. GBFB delivered approximately 30 million meals last year, according to Dussek. With more community support, Dussek hopes to distribute at least one nutritious meal a day to those in need.\n“I believe that hunger is curable. With under and unemployment still too high, this is our future and we have to take action quickly if we are going to end hunger here. Together we can get close to our mission, to end hunger,” said Dussek.\n\n#next_pages_container{width:5px;hight:5px;position:absolute;top:-100px;left:-100px;z-index:2147483647!important;}\n\n\n\xa0\n\n#next_pages_container { width: 5px; hight: 5px; position: absolute; top: -100px; left: -100px; z-index: 2147483647 !important; }\n\n\n\xa0\n\n', 'Mar 8, 2013'), ('\nThree plates, engraved with vulgar messages and profanities, were found in Paresky Commons last week. Employees in the dish room discovered the first plate with engraved profanity when it came through the conveyer belt. Two more plates with similar messages were discovered the following day, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students and Residential Life. The person responsible for the vandalism remains unknown. Murphy said that although he will review footage from security cameras placed in different parts of Paresky, the chances of identifying the culprit this way is highly unlikely. The black lettering, which appeared to be done by an engraving machine, was about two and half inches tall, according to an e-mail sent to the community by Murphy. Murphy sent the first e-mail to the faculty on Sunday, March 3rd, soliciting their help in finding the perpetrator. The student body received a similar e-mail on Monday, March 4th. If caught, the offender will be disciplined for destruction of school property, as well as for violating the rule of decency and respect for the community and other people, according to Murphy. Murphy speculates that motives for this act of vandalism could be shock value or hatred for the school. He doubts that the messages were directed at members of Paresky. “There have been things written on the bathroom walls that have been around forever, but this seems to be another level up where to destroy something, someone had to go out of their way to take the plates out, somehow print [the words] and bring it back,” Murphy said. “It is more than just a moment of being mad. I even feel sad for whoever did it because I can’t imagine what drives someone to have that level of anger,” he continued. Acts of vandalism, especially graffiti, have been an ongoing problem for the Art Department and librarians at the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL). Library staff members discover profanities, slang and vulgar images written and drawn on the basement whiteboards and chalkboards weekly, according to Jeffrey Marzluft, Library Associate Director for Instructional Services. Wooden desks in all parts of the library are etched in with similar graffiti as well. “The frequency or intensity of the messages do somewhat coincide with the academic cycle. When the kids are really stressed, we are likely to find more stuff written,” Marzluft said. “I don’t see graffiti in other buildings as to the same extent we see here in the library. This bothers me personally because we go out of our way to be a student-centered area and in return for the comfort the building gets abused,” continued Marzluft. Additionally, several weeks ago, someone kicked a hole about two feet wide in a wall inside the stacks in the OWHL. Drawings or carvings of vulgar messages have also been discovered on walls and desks in art classrooms as well. “Vandalism is an ongoing problem that appears to ‘flare up’ every few years. Not everyone reports vandalism—in classroom, dorms, classrooms so it is hard to define its breadth,” wrote Emily Trespas, Instructor in Art, in an e-mail to The Phillipian. “Personally, in the last 13 years I’ve taught at Phillips, I have empowered my students to assist us—as a community—to help monitor, prevent and intervene in such disrespectful thoughtless acts. We can all lead by modeling positive behavior and not just with intervening acts of defacing property,” continued Trespas. Murphy, Marzluft and Trespas believe that the fundamental mindset of the community, especially of students, needs to be changed in order to fully address the issue of vandalism. Murphy said that the plate incidents indicate a “culture of anonymity” that is accepted in the Andover community. “I don’t really want to get into cameras and the business of having to watch everyone all the time. We want a student body that can handle the responsibility and independence that is offered to them as being a part of a student here,” he said. Marzluft said that even adults on campus have turned a blind-eye to issues generated by anonymity. However, he believes that the change has to be initiated from the students in order to truly address the issue of vandalism. “I don’t think that it goes through the students’ heads that what they are doing, the graffiti and carving [that] is destructive, but it should. It requires a culture shift in the student body,” Marzluft said.\n\n', 'Mar 7, 2013'), ('\nAfter careful review of a record-setting 31 applications, the Community and Multicultural Development (CAMD) Scholar Program selected DJ Bierwirth ’14, Zoe Chazen ’14, David Cho ’14, Harshita Gaba ’14, Malina Simard-Halm ’14 and Timothy Wynter ’14 as the CAMD Scholars for the 2013-2014 school year on March 1.

Cho, who has a five year old sister, is personally connected to the topic. “I couldn’t imagine if anything like this, the bullying, were to happen to her,” said Cho. \n Cho has already accumulated a number of journals and news articles to start his research. In addition, Cho plans to interview students and teachers in Korea to discuss how bullying has been perceived and managed within the classroom. \n MALINA SIMARD-HALM \n Advisor: Maggie Jackson, Associate Director of Graham House\n Simard-Halm’s project, “LGBT Parenting: Children of Gay Fathers,” will explore the psychological impact of being raised by a gay father with a specific interest in assisted reproduction.\n In addition to having been raised by gay fathers, Simard-Halm chose this topic because impact on American families today. “It’s affecting a lot of families here in the United States and around the world. It is definitely important to me and a lot of families, and I think my research could ameliorate the defenses for families like mine, and create more awareness for what it is really like to be raised by LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender] parents,” she said.\n Over the summer, Simard-Halm will interview people who have used the company Growing Generations, co-founded by her father, as well as send out surveys around her area.

She said, “After a speaker, Reza Aslan [founder of “Aslan Media,” an online journal that provides news to the Middle East] came to Andover a couple of weeks ago to talk about to talk about the Arab Spring, I realized after speaking to him that I could narrow my topic down even more to the Green Movement…a push toward revolution in 2009 as part of the Arab Spring.”\n As part of her research, Bierwirth plans to travel to Iran and interview different students at the University of Iran as well as the International School in Iran to discuss their impressions and reactions to the Green Movement in 2009.

In addition to these on-campus resources, Gaba has been in touch with Evan Grae Davis, director of the documentary “It’s a Girl,” a film about gendercide in India and China.\n ZOE CHAZEN \n Advisor: Michael Swarttz, Rabi\n Chazen’s project, “The Impact of Zionism and the State of Israel on American Jewish Identity,” will revolve around the history of Zionism in America, as well its present day impact.\n Chazen was inspired by her visit to Israel in the summer of 2010. \n Chazen said, “When I came to Andover, I was intrigued by the different responses to Israel by both non-Jews and Jews. And because I associate my Judaism with Israel, I thought it would be interesting to explore that.” Chazen plans to contact Brandeis University’s Cohen Center for Jewish Studies to talk about its research on the impact of Birthright, a program that sends Jewish kids to Israel, and how the program has affected the students’ perception of Israel.

IRT was founded in 1990 by Dr. Kelly Wise, Executive Director of IRT. \n “What’s even more significant is that we know the majority of those 235 alums are pursuing careers already as college faculty members or administrators, so they are not only completing the doctorate, but also moving into the positions that we had hoped,” said Asabe Polomo, Director of IRT. \n Approximately 100 undergraduate students are accepted into IRT every year, 30 of whom participate in a four-week program at Andover during summer session. The students take graduate-level courses in education and receive counseling throughout the application and financial aid processes for graduate school, according to the press release on the Andover website. \n IRT staff members travel to approximately 70 colleges nationwide, including public universities, tribal colleges and minority-serving institutions, to recruit students for the program. The colleges that the IRT works with agree to give financial support to the students. The IRT also covers application fees and participation expenses. \n “In particular we try to target black and Latino males because we believe that they are a group even more underrepresented in education. We also host online information sessions using webinars and video conferencing, such as Skype, to reach out to interested applicants that attend institutions that we may not reach,” said Polomo.\n The IRT is the only organization in the nation that focuses on the transition point for students between undergraduate and graduate program, according to Polomo. \n Polomo added, “At Phillips Academy, I believe the students are attracted to [Andover] because of the quality of teaching. The kind of rigor that comes with the quality of the Phillips Academy education is unique and unfortunately the best of it only exists at the private schools to which most of America does not have access to. Our commitment is to leverage the model of excellence that exists here and is supported unanimously by the administration at other public institutions.”\n “Our work is really, very supportive of students who already bring a set of critical lens to issues in education and a commitment to advancing diversity aims as well as improving social justice in education.

Roberts works with offices across campus to help with records management.\n “[Appraisal] is one of the most interesting and challenging parts of being an archivist. [It] can be at a point a difficult professional judgment call, because obviously we can’t keep everything, just in terms of storage space, and kinds of managing all of that stuff. Even if it’s digital, it’s still so much to manage. We have to make decisions,” said Roberts.\n “One criteria is obviously potential research value, but the major thing in terms of school records is documenting the decision-making process, whether it be by The Board of Trustees, or deans or other offices on campus, like Admissions, College Counseling, [or] alumni. It may require some conversation to figure out what that actually means, in terms of this chunk of records correspondence versus subject files or reports,” said Roberts. \n Roberts also handles restricted materials in the archives. Many records are closed for 25 years after their creation. Records from the Board of Trustees are under restricted access for 50 years, while Student and Faculty records are under restricted access for 75 years.\n Roberts is currently working on scanning a collection of photos from the 1970s of Abbot campus and Andover student life for an alumni magazine article about the merger of two schools. The Abbot Academy materials are a priority particularly because next year is the 40th anniversary of the merger of Phillips and Abbot Academies.\n Roberts is particularly interested in digitizing a series of photographs documenting different parts of campus throughout the years.\n Some of her favorites include a photograph of an Abbot Academy student room in 1938 (pictured), and one of the signing of the merger between Andover and Abbot Academy in 1973, which shows the heads of the Boards of Trustees from each school, Ted Sizer, Headmaster of Andover, and Donald Gordon, Principal of Abbot Academy.\n “I feel like these photos are able to really capture what it was like to be a student at the school, either PA or Abbot, at different points in time,” she said.\n Digitizing the archives will provide access to a wider range of people, as well as help to ensure that paper documents will not be lost or destroyed. This will not, however, replace original documents.\n “There is a huge value on having the actual material as an artifact. Having the original copy is important as well because even with the huge advancement in the digitizing technology these days, there might be aspects to an original that may not be replicable… [like] the smell of the book and the texture of the pages, and who knows what these things can imply,” she said. \n The digitization process at Andover was facilitated by a grant from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners to the Boston Public Library, which used the money to provide free digitization service for institutions across the state of Massachusetts, according to Roberts.\n With the grant, the Knafel Map Collection in the Andover Archives has already been digitized and can now be searched on the Leventhal Map Center at Boston Public website.\n Roberts has previously worked as Executive Director of Immigrant City Archives (now Lawrence History Center), college archivist at Springfield College and head of special collections at the State Library of Massachusetts\n “I enjoy the varied nature of the work in Archives and Special Collections at Phillips Academy from working with donors, organizing collections, supporting administrators and making presentations to alumni. My favorite part of my job at PA is working with students on research projects,” she wrote in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n “I definitely want to encourage students to come to the archives for research or even just for personal interest.

Hosted by Boston University’s International Affairs Association, BosMUN drew 1,400 high school students to discuss international issues and conflicts with peers in different mock committees that mirrored diplomatic forums like the United Nations Security Council and the Organization of American States.\n“In some committees, there were midnight crisis sessions, when students are woken up at midnight and brought back to their committee rooms to debate some more,” said Maia Hirschler ’13, co-head of Andover MUN. Model United Nations: Andover MUN Takes 16 Individual Awards\n“[BosMUN] is a way to use the debate skills that we hone over the year and to use them in a new setting with new competition. We get to see how we do as a team and as individuals on a national stage,” said MJ Engel ’13, co-head of MUN.\nAfter three days of debate, Andover received 16 individual delegate awards. Samuel Green ’13, Junius Williams ’14 and Dan Wang ’14 took first place, receiving Best Delegate Awards in their committees. Nolan Crawford ’15, Clark Perkins ’14, Gabbi Fisher ’13, Hirschler and Abigail Keller ’14 received second-place recognition, winning Outstanding Delegate Awards. Adham Moustafa ’14, Diana Tchadi ’14 and Angela Leocata ’13 received Honorable Delegate. MJ Engel ’13, Mikaela Rabb ’14, Charlotte Chazen ’15 and Zoe Chazen ’14 received Verbal Commendations.

The group plans to attend events such as the Harvard South Asian Association’s annual “Ghungroo” cultural show and participate in activities like getting ice cream and seeing movies together.\n“[The mentorship program] is a good place to get to know the other Southeast Asians, but also to have people who are older than us who know what we’ve been through, and who are in the same environment as us. We all come from the same cultural background, and have been through the same high pressure academic environment,” said Westfall.\nHendarta said the club hopes to expand the mentorship program to Boston University and Boston College, though this is a long-term goal for the future. SEA Club sent out applications to approximately 25 Andover students of Southeast Asian heritage on February 24 to join the mentorship program. The deadline to apply is March 8. SEA Club was created at the start of this year and aims to connect Southeast Asian students at Andover with one another. The Southeast Asian nations include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Burma (Myanmar), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2013'), ('\nOn Monday evening, Student Council unanimously voted to reduce the number of Senior Representatives from five to three and to integrate Cluster Presidents into Student Council. \n Effective for the 2013-2014 school year, Senior Representatives will be elected by the entire Senior Class, instead of by cluster. As their positions will not be cluster-specific, the Senior Representatives will remain on Student Council but not on Cluster Council.\n MJ Engel ’13, Executive Secretary, said that one of the reasons for the proposal was that historically the Senior Representative position was undefined and had few responsibilities, making it difficult for Senior Representatives to be active members of Student Council. \n In the current system, there are five Senior Representatives, one for each cluster. The representatives are elected by Seniors in their respective clusters. The role of the Senior Representative is to attend both Student Council and Cluster Council meetings. The Senior Representatives are in charge of communicating with and connecting the two organizations.\n “We think that [the new] system will carve out a more specific role for [the Seniors on student council] and help them to complete their job more effectively. Senior Representatives will be a lot more about representing the Senior Class,” said Engel.\n “Senior Representatives used to provide Student Council with the cluster perspective, but we thought a more efficient connection could be made with the Cluster Presidents, and then have three at large Senior Representatives,” added Hemang Kaul ’13, School President.\n Communicating directly with Cluster Presidents will also increase the productiveness of Student Council, according to Kaul. \n “The Senior Representatives will be attending to their class, and the Cluster Presidents will be able to provide cluster feedback more efficiently because they are somewhat more involved with the cluster day-to-day and in more contact with cluster deans,” said Kaul. \n The initiative was proposed by the Student Council Review Committee, an ad hoc sub-committee of Student Government with the intention of assessing and remodeling Student Council. The Student Council Review Committee has met periodically throughout Winter Term and also proposed the new Co-President structure approved in January.\n The committee is comprised of five students and five faculty members. Engel, Kaul, Samuel L. Green ’13, former Editor in Chief of The Phillipian, Junius Williams ’14, Upper Representative, and Tessa Peterson ’15, former Junior Representative, represent the student body on the committee. The faculty members on the committee are Jennifer Elliott, Dean of Abbot Cluster, Frank Tipton, Dean of West Quad North Cluster, Fernando Alonso, Advisor to Student Council, and Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. Becky Sykes, Associate Head of School, is an ex-officio member of the committee. \n After discussing and crafting the idea in the Student Council Review Committee, Kaul made the proposal to Student Council on Monday night.\n Peterson said that this change will create a tighter functioning team instead of a large group of assorted individuals. “Additionally, instead of allotting very few responsibilities to a large number of people, the new model will have fewer people sharing responsibilities,” she said. \n This change was not driven by the Co-Presidential model, but was part of the same conversation to restructure the student council as a whole, according to Engel.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2013'), ('\nAs the keynote speaker for the 12th Annual Cassiciacum Dialogue at Merrimack College on Wednesday, Michael Legaspi, Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies, asked his audience to consider the the role of the Bible in modern society after presenting about his book, “The Death of Scripture and the Rise of Biblical Studies,” which examines the development of new ways of looking at the Bible in the 18th century. The Annual Cassiciacum Dialogue, a discussion led by distinguished philosophy scholars, takes place at Merrimack College every year. Legaspi’s research in this book explores the role of the Enlightenment in the development of new systems of biblical criticism that sought to replace older forms of biblical theology, according Legaspi. “Instead of looking at the Bible as a churchly book, or a theological work, they treated it as a kind of ancient literary classic with great cultural value. Their goal was to replace older, traditional forms of biblical study with a new scholarly kind of interpretation that would accord with the larger effort to produce rational, tolerant and loyal servants of the state. In this way, they deemphasized the religious dimensions of biblical study and aimed to make it a politically and socially useful enterprise in a new, modern framework,” wrote Legaspi in an e-mail to The Phillipian. Legaspi’s presentation took on a more modern perspective, considering Biblical education in contemporary culture and secularism in order to spark conversation among the audience members. “People talked about the American paradox: despite having a separation of church and state and a formally non-religious system of government, American culture has been influenced, and continues to be influenced by the Bible and its own distinct forms of Christianity,” wrote Legaspi in an e-mail to The Phillipian. Another topic of discussion was religious tolerance and how various forms of religious training can promote rationality, especially considering the fact that the Bible has been the inspiration for many important social movements such as Civil Rights. “If there is one thing I would be working for through my presentations, it is [to] sort of break down a lot of the false ideas people have about religion, that it is antithetical to democracy and to reason,” he said. “Instead, I think religion is an important part of shaping a society that is genuinely democratic, rational and peaceful. I hope people will come away from my presentation with a more nuanced, appreciative understanding of religion,” he continued. Legaspi hopes to spur discussion about the role of Bible in educational institutions, political discourse and society in general through his book and presentation. “I’m not a prophet, I’m not an expert or a guru. I don’t see myself as having a special wisdom to pass on, so really I am a facilitator trying to raise awareness and get fruitful conversations going about issues related to basically the role of religion in contemporary society,” said Legaspi. Legaspi’s book studies the creation of the academic Bible and its role in contemporary society, specifically focusing on the German Enlightenment of the 18th century. Legaspi started researching in 2003, spending a year in Germany to gather information on the topic. The book was published in 2010. Currently, Legaspi said that he is working on a second book about how different Jewish and Christian thinkers approached, articulated and applied the idea of wisdom in different settings and time periods. Legaspi drew his inspiration from a 2008 gathering including philosophers, economists, psychologists and political scientists to discuss what it means to have wisdom in current society, according to Legaspi. “The idea of wisdom really stood for the quest to understand how everything fits together, and we decided we would each go back to our area of disciplines and write something about [it]. How does the political relate to the social, how does the social relate to the moral, how does the moral relate to the intellectual and so on,” he said. In his third year at Andover, Legaspi teaches four religion-philosophy courses, including Religions of the Book, Introduction to New Testament, Views of Human Nature and Responses to the Holocaust. Prior to Andover, Legaspi taught at Creighton University, a Catholic Jesuit institution in Omaha, Nebraska, for four years. “I started teaching at Andover during summer session as a graduate student [at Harvard University] and I really grew to love this school. It was funny, I would teach [at the university] and then come here for the summer session, so I was always comparing the two. I realized that I liked being at Andover better. I found the students more engaged and intellectually curious and I have so much fun in the classroom,” said Legaspi. Born and raised in a devout Catholic family, Legaspi began to develop genuine interest for the Bible during his high school years. “The more I studied the Bible in an academic setting, the more interested I became in the question of what does this all have to do with us,” he said. “Clearly, this is not a society where authority of the Bible is accepted by everyone or a society where everyone is thoroughly Jewish, Christian or anything really, so I began asking what role does the Bible have in contemporary culture,” he continued. Legaspi has spoken at universities all over the country, including Harvard, Princeton and Duke. He has also travelled overseas to England to speak at the University of Saint Andrews and the University of Edinburgh. He will also visit the University of Cambridge later in the spring.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2013'), ('\nAfter writing letters and sending care packages to members of the United States military an ocean away, volunteers in the Adopt-a-Platoon community service program met a soldier and alumnus via Skype last Monday. \n Tom Barron ’04, an executive officer in the U.S. military, spoke to students in the Adopt-a-Platoon program in a Skype conference about his experience at Andover and his deployment to Afghanistan. Barron also explained factors that influenced his decision to enter the military. \n Adopt-a-Platoon is a community service program where students send letters to members of an army platoon of 40-50 soldiers that Andover has “adopted,” according to Monique Cueto-Potts, Community Service Director.\n “Adopt-a-Platoon is the only program the [Community Service] Office runs where there is no direct, face-to-face involvement with a community partner, so I thought it was especially important for the students in this program to have a chance to speak with someone who may be just like a soldier to whom they are writing a letter or sending a care package,” Cueto-Potts wrote in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n After graduating from Andover in 2004, Barron took a year off before attending Harvard University as part of the Class of 2009. During his sophomore year, Barron decided to join the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), a program offering scholarships to college students in exchange for active military duty.\n Barron’s decision to enter the military was driven mostly by his experiences growing up with a father who served in the Vietnam War and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. Barron remembered looking up to his father and his friends who were veterans.\n Barron served for 15 months as the platoon leader of a 36-soldier rifle platoon from the 4th Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. He also conducted a six month tour in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Barron is now the executive officer of his platoon.\n “I had to go through quite a culture shock, actually, coming to Andover and seeing that everyone else didn’t understand the military in the way that I did. And that was one of the healthiest things for my understanding of military service that ever happened,” Barron said.\n After hearing Seth Moulton ’97 speak about his experiences serving in the Iraq war at an All School Meeting during his Senior year, Barron’s interest in the military grew.\n “I had been extremely outraged, and actually, I still am outraged by the Iraq War… [There] is still an enormous need for strong principled, thoughtful, compassionate leaders, particularly in an area that has so much moral hazard,” Barron said.\n Barron believes strongly that it is important and useful for an Andover student to learn and care about the military and the policies that surround it.\n “To me, the best thing you can do is read a lot, to understand how our political process works…Both those wars [in Iraq and Afghanistan] started while I was in high school, and I would argue that many of the failures that have happened throughout them have arisen from having a military that is divided from society,” Barron said. \n Barron’s experience in the army opened him up to different experiences and gave him opportunities to mentor and teach younger soldiers as a platoon leader.\n “The most profound things that you can do as a military officer are the combinations of leader, teacher, mentor, guidance counselor and boss to a lot of really young, really bright and some not-so bright, but really well-intentioned kids who rely on your mentorship,” Barron said.\n Barron served as a team leader in a rural region of the Kandahar Province with little running water. “What kept me motivated, day in and day out, was my soldiers, and, in many respects, I felt really fortunate to be responsible for them because it keeps your mind off of boredom and fear,” Barron said.\n “I find myself giving my soldiers financial advice, or advice about going to college, advice about buying homes, things that, honestly, I don’t know that much about,” Barron said.\n Barron’s platoon had a lot of free time when not patrolling borders, he said. “In between patrolling, at least where I was, you had a lot of time to read books, magazines, newspapers occasionally or letters. We played a lot of cards, to be totally honest, and, with the ease of acquiring bootleg DVDs, we watched a lot of movies… But each experience is completely unique,” Barron said. \n Although the speech was primarily for members of Adopt-A-Platoon, it was also open to the public. Barron spoke via Skype because he currently lives in North Carolina and was not able to reach campus.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2013'), ('\nThumbing through a collection of photographs from 1974, Paige Roberts, Archivist and Head of Special Collections, pauses on a photo of a girl walking in a white dress and explains that the girl pictured was the first Abbot Academy student to graduate from Andover after the merger.\n Paige Roberts is currently working to digitize documents, photographs and other artifacts from Andover’s history in an effort to organize and make available historical collections found in the Oliver Wendell Holmes Library (OWHL).\n The digitized documents and photographs will be available online to the public for free on a webpage Roberts created. \n According to Roberts, the digitized materials from the archives can now be searched for on the NOBLE site, the Leventhal Map Center at Boston Public Library and the Internet Archive and will be included the Digital Public Library of America once it launches in mid-April.\n “The priority as an information professional is to try to provide access that is easy and convenient,” said Roberts.\n “The point of putting all this effort and money into digitizing is [to] provide access, and this doesn’t just mean having that book, photograph or whatever it may be online, but [making] it easy for students and whomever [is] interested to find it, use it and share it,” she said.\n The Archive collection includes student publications, yearbooks, course catalogs, alumni bulletins, photographs and other documents regarding Phillips Academy and Abbot, according to Roberts.\n Roberts has been digitizing photographs and other materials from the collection since her arrival at Andover in January 2012, resuming the work of Tim Sprattler, former Archivist.\n Not all the collections in the Archives will be digitized due to their overwhelming quantity, according to Roberts.\n Access to some private documents such as the Board of Trustee records and Student and Faculty Profiles will also be restricted for institutional reasons.\n As an archivist, part of Roberts’s job is appraisal, the process of assessing the research value of documents to decide what is kept in the archives, whether the items will have a limited period of retention or be entered into the collection permanently. Roberts works with offices across campus to help with records management.\n “[Appraisal] is one of the most interesting and challenging parts of being an archivist. [It] can be at a point a difficult professional judgment call, because obviously we can’t keep everything, just in terms of storage space, and kinds of managing all of that stuff. Even if it’s digital, it’s still so much to manage. We have to make decisions,” said Roberts.\n “One criteria is obviously potential research value, but the major thing in terms of school records is documenting the decision-making process, whether it be by The Board of Trustees, or deans or other offices on campus, like Admissions, College Counseling, [or] alumni. It may require some conversation to figure out what that actually means, in terms of this chunk of records correspondence versus subject files or reports,” said Roberts. \n Roberts also handles restricted materials in the archives. Many records are closed for 25 years after their creation. Records from the Board of Trustees are under restricted access for 50 years, while Student and Faculty records are under restricted access for 75 years.\n Roberts is currently working on scanning a collection of photos from the 1970s of Abbot campus and Andover student life for an alumni magazine article about the merger of two schools. The Abbot Academy materials are a priority particularly because next year is the 40th anniversary of the merger of Phillips and Abbot Academies.\n Roberts is particularly interested in digitizing a series of photographs documenting different parts of campus throughout the years.\n Some of her favorites include a photograph of an Abbot Academy student room in 1938 (pictured), and one of the signing of the merger between Andover and Abbot Academy in 1973, which shows the heads of the Boards of Trustees from each school, Ted Sizer, Headmaster of Andover, and Donald Gordon, Principal of Abbot Academy.\n “I feel like these photos are able to really capture what it was like to be a student at the school, either PA or Abbot, at different points in time,” she said.\n Digitizing the archives will provide access to a wider range of people, as well as help to ensure that paper documents will not be lost or destroyed. This will not, however, replace original documents.\n “There is a huge value on having the actual material as an artifact. Having the original copy is important as well because even with the huge advancement in the digitizing technology these days, there might be aspects to an original that may not be replicable… [like] the smell of the book and the texture of the pages, and who knows what these things can imply,” she said. \n The digitization process at Andover was facilitated by a grant from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners to the Boston Public Library, which used the money to provide free digitization service for institutions across the state of Massachusetts, according to Roberts.\n With the grant, the Knafel Map Collection in the Andover Archives has already been digitized and can now be searched on the Leventhal Map Center at Boston Public website.\n Roberts has previously worked as Executive Director of Immigrant City Archives (now Lawrence History Center), college archivist at Springfield College and head of special collections at the State Library of Massachusetts\n “I enjoy the varied nature of the work in Archives and Special Collections at Phillips Academy from working with donors, organizing collections, supporting administrators and making presentations to alumni. My favorite part of my job at PA is working with students on research projects,” she wrote in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n “I definitely want to encourage students to come to the archives for research or even just for personal interest. That is really the goal for the archive here. We aren’t here to be the gatekeepers; we want to provide everyone access to the material and help them really learn from it,” she said.\n\n', 'Feb 28, 2013'), ('\n### Gelb Science Center: Astronomist Explains Human Light Pollution\nDr. Douglas Arion, Director of the Carthage Institute of Astronomy and the President of Galileoscope LLC, spoke to Andover students about the human connections with the universe and the importance of preserving the night sky.“If you closely examine the size of our planet and then compare that to the whole universe, it makes you think about how insignificant we truly are,” said Arion. Arion emphasized how celestial events significantly affect the behavior of animals, the appearance of living things and the structure of nature. According to Arion, satellite images of Earth show that humans overuse light energy, and cause the deterioration of living conditions for people, plants and animals.\nArion was invited to Andover by Caroline Odden, Instructor in Physics and Astronomy, who met him at the American Astronomical Society meeting in January, and James Falese ’14, who will work with Arion on an Independent Project next term.

Instead of one School President, there will be two School Co-Presidents beginning this election cycle. One major change to the election process with the Co-President model will be that the two final candidate pairs will debate during an All School Meeting, instead of the top three candidates making speeches as they have in the past, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students.\n The new process is not yet finalized, according to Hemang Kaul ’13, current School President. The Student Council Review Committee met on Wednesday to discuss plans for the debate. Members of the current Executive Board, Kaul, Rolando Bonachea ’13, Vice President of Student Council, and MJ Engel ’13, Executive Secretary of Student Council, will direct the discussion as moderators.\n “The debate is something that is new, and it will help showcase skills that are pertinent to the Co-President job description,” said Engel.\n Aside from the change to Co-Presidents and the introduction of the debate, no other changes have been made to the election process. \n Campaign guidelines will remain the same as those in last year’s election cycle. These include a $50 maximum budget, a maximum poster size of 11 by 17 inches and one-minute videos to be produced in the Polk-Lillard Center.\n “Two years ago we had an election that felt very chaotic and not very positive, so last year’s board and myself and Dr. Cernota, who was the faculty advisor to Student Council at the time, sat down and hammered out what we thought would be good guidelines for everyone to follow,” said Murphy.\n The reactions to the Co-President model have been positive thus far.\n “The benefit of Co-Presidents is that [the presidency] is a very big job, and there is enough for two people to do. In my view, two are better than one. I think it will allow there to be some accountability. If you have two people that are supposed to get things done, it seems more likely that it will actually get done,” said Murphy. \n Engel said, “I believe the Co-Presidential model gave the opportunity to a lot more people who might not have thought about running beforehand a chance to run. So far they have shown great respect and great competitive spirit so far in the campaign. They have remained respectful of their opponents; they have remained respectful of the process in general, and I think that is going to be a great election season.”\n Bonachea said, “I think the Co-President model definitely makes it easier because you can disperse the work of both the campaign and actually being President between two people.”\n The Co-President model has affected the candidate pairs differently. Candidates elaborated on how they hope to use the new structure to the advantage of student council.\n “By working together we can reach more people and make a bigger difference. Jake and I come from very different educational backgrounds. Jake will be a four-year senior, and I was a repeat new lower, so together we have had different experiences. We can take these experiences that we’ve both had and blend them to create the best Andover possible,” said Gallagher.\n “The Co-President model fosters cooperation. It fosters a more “non-sibi” and less arrogant spirit in those seeking office. Most of all, it creates more than one figure who stands for the school, allowing for a more accurate embodiment and better representation of the student body,” wrote Peale in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “There is half as much responsibility and work to complete for each member. It is also very convenient to have a companion to discuss platform ideas and the next initiatives the team should take. Clint and I work very well together and have been able to derive unique ideas working together. The process also involves mental stress and having a teammate makes it less solitary and isolable,” wrote Simard-Halm in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “Getting to know each other is actually the basis of Dan’s and my platform. We want to make the school feel like a family rather than always a pressure-cooker, and I think the Co-President model enhances that message and makes that goal a little more attainable,” said Lippey.\n The new structure also affected the candidates’ decision to run for Co-Presidents.\n “I would have been much less likely to run on my own, but having Co-Presidents definitely encourages more pairs to run. I think the decision to have Co-Presidents is an interesting one, especially in light of the election last year and John Palfrey’s theme of connected learning this year. I see Co-Presidents as encouraging the spirit of collaboration on campus, reaching an even broader net of students, and getting even more accomplished,” wrote Murree in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “[Clark and I] were both planning to run for the presidency before the Co-President model was even considered. However, seeing as we had both worked together as Lower reps and knew we could collaborate with each other, we mutually decided that running together would kill two birds with one stone. Quite a few of our campaign ideas were quite similar, so it has been easy to mesh them,” wrote Onome in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nAfter discussion amongst faculty and with Student Council in the fall, the academic calendar for the 2013-2014 school year was finalized on Tuesday under the new system of equal term lengths. Next year, each term will be 11 weeks long, including Extended Period Week at the end of each term. Other changes include moving Wellness Week to the last week of January during Winter Term, as opposed to having it during Fall Term. “With a shorter Fall Term, there was a feeling that having something like Wellness Week to disrupt the adjustment in the first term at Andover for a lot of students didn’t seem [like] the best idea,” said John Rogers, Dean of Studies. Under the new calendar model, Parents Weekend falls on the same weekend as the PSAT test every other year, which includes the 2013-2014 school year. Because the date of Parents Weekend is determined by the athletic schedule, it cannot easily be changed to avoid overlapping with PSATs, said Rogers. Next year, Lowers and Uppers will take the PSATs on Wednesday, October 16 instead of on a Saturday to avoid coinciding with Parents’ Weekend. Seniors will be given the time on that Wednesday to either work on their college applications or participate in a special program with the College Counseling Office. Other activities will be arranged for Juniors on that day as well, according to Rogers. “We need facilities like [Paresky] Commons and [Case Memorial] Cage to host meals for Parents Weekend, so trying to have 600 kids take the PSATs on Parents Weekend would just be too much happening on campus, ” said Rogers. The length of Fall Term previously varied depending on when Labor Day and Thanksgiving fell, causing Fall Term to be up to three weeks longer than Winter Term and Spring Term at times, according to Rogers. “With the adoption of the new calendar, we will have terms that are the same length as each other and that do not vary in length from year to year. For the purpose of curriculum planning, a consistent envelope is very helpful,” wrote Rogers in the “Summary of Pros and Cons of the Revised Calendar.” Next year, Fall Term will end on Friday, November 22, followed by a 12-day-long Thanksgiving Break. Students will return for the start of Winter Term on Thursday, December 5. Winter Term will resume on Tuesday, January 7. Compared to the 2012-2013 calendar, next year’s Thanksgiving Break is two days longer, while Winter Break is one week shorter. However, Winter Break for the 2012-2013 school year was unusually long due to the date of Thanksgiving. Under the new schedule, Winter Break will vary between 18-25 days, which will only be about two days shorter on average compared to Winter Break under the previous calendar model, according to Rogers. With Winter Break in the middle of Winter Term, the Academic Council is working to produce clear guidelines for faculty regarding the amount of work that can be assigned over break. This will ensure that students are not overwhelmed by assignments over the holiday season, said Rogers. Another reason for equalizing the term lengths was to make Fall Term grades available to colleges for Seniors applying early. There has been a growing trend showing that more and more Andover students were put at a disadvantage in admissions because the lack of concrete Fall Term grades, according to Rogers. “A number of colleges were reporting back to us that it was really hard for them to make decisions, and some were actually refusing to do so. And, even if colleges were willing to look at Andover students, they just might have just assumed the students grades were more or less the same as before, but the reality is, Senior Fall tends to be a really strong term academically for most [students],” he said. The new calendar model is expected to give college counselors more time with the Seniors prior to Winter Break. “My office and the Academic Council are the ones that brought the proposal to end the Fall Term before Thanksgiving to the whole faculty, and they voted on the outline of the calendar. The Registrar, Betsy Korn, is the one that actually puts together the calendar every year in consultation with all the major offices around campus like athletics and College Counseling,” Rogers said. www\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nOn Tuesday night, February 12, 2013, the cluster deans met and approved a proposal made by the House Counselor Committee to add an extra hour to junior room visiting for a trial period. The trial allows room visits between two juniors of opposite gender on Friday nights in the winter term from 8:30-9:30 p.m. Scott Hoenig, House Counselor in Rockwell Dormitory for junior boys, came up with the idea. The pilot will be applied to any ninth grade dorm with house counselors who are willing to have their dorm participate. Although all ninth grade dorms will be invited to take part in this experiment, it is not required. The experimental policy will go into effect Friday night, February 15th, 2012. The pilot program will continue through the end of the winter term for a total of four Friday evenings. Six of nine freshman dorms will participate. Rockwell House, Isham, Nathan Hale House, America House, Double Brick House and Pemberton Cottage are the dorms that have chosen to participate, while French House, Hearsey House and Draper Cottage have decided not to. The current junior visiting policy allows juniors to visit members of their own class from five to eight o’clock p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Under the current system, juniors cannot visit on Fridays or Saturdays. During the spring term, juniors can visit from three to eight o’clock p.m. on Sundays, according to the Blue Book. Juniors must keep the door 90 degrees open. Like all room visits, juniors must sign in and sign out with a house counselor who will remain in the dorm for the duration of the visit. The junior visiting policy has generated much discussion recently. In late 2010, faculty discussed the existence of junior room visiting and voted on whether juniors should be allowed to have parietals. Some faculty members said the practice of room visiting for ninth graders should be retained because it prompted good conversations on sexuality, sexual activity, and relationships, according to Hoenig. In April of 2011, faculty voted to allow juniors to have room visits only with other juniors in junior dormitories. According to an article published in The Phillipian, the strictly junior-to-junior parietal policy passed with a majority vote of 108 faculty members. The House Counselor Committee has heavily discussed the issue of junior room visiting since fall term. This week, Hoenig wrote and presented a proposal to the cluster deans through Paul Murphy, Dean of Students. Hoenig received support for the extra hour on a trial period. Ninth grade house counselors were sent an email about the proposed change on Tuesday night, said Hoenig. House counselors were then able to choose to participate or not. The trial was made official late Thursday night after house counselors from all junior dorms had given Hoenig a response to the program. According to Hoenig, the rationale behind the proposed change is to offer juniors a more convenient time to have room visits. The current hours are not ideal for room visiting, as house counselors are often not available during these hours. In addition, students are busy focusing on homework and extracurricular activities during the current room visiting times. On Friday evenings from 8:30-9:30, a house counselor is already on duty and would be available to sign juniors in and out and properly regulate room visits. Friday nights are also a time when students do not have clubs or practices to attend. Hoenig said that the trial period will allow the Administration to test the effectiveness of this system.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nEarly last week, Peter Merrill, Instructor in Russian and German, received a Distinguished Service Award for his contributions to Russian language education by the American Council of Teachers of Russian (ACTR). \n Merrill, who has been on the board of the ACTR since 1995, helped create national standards for High School Russian education, such as the development of the Russian Advanced Placement exam.\n In December 2012, the ACTR invited Merrill to attend the February gathering where he was honored with the award. He was not informed of the award until the day of the event, however. \n “Surprise and gratitude are probably the words to describe my first reactions. These kinds of commitments, especially when you’re already in a full time job, end up taking a lot of time, so it was nice to be recognized for what I did,” said Merrill. \n “In the last five years, we haven’t seen [an award] of this significance. This is pretty big. We’re talking about a lifetime achievement award,” said Peter Neissa, Head of the World Languages Department.\n Founded in 1974, the ACTR is dedicated to improving the teaching of Russian through conferences, programs and publications, according to the ACTR website. \n Merrill said that the ACTR was needed to structure the curriculum and to prepare students for the next level. \n “These organizations give teachers a voice and a means to communicate, at least indirectly, with college teachers to get what they need to know about helping kids integrate into college, or what needs to be changed in terms of curriculum,” he said.\n Since his arrival at Andover in 1989, Merrill has made significant contributions to the Russian Department. \n “He has worked to help the understanding of Russian politics in the United States to high school students, not just [at] PA. He came to us with a huge wealth of information background. Students who have gone through Russian have benefited from his expertise,” said Neissa.\n “Merrill understands where students should be going to in our current time. What does a global perspective mean? Does it mean learning about another history course or does it mean integrating knowledge, culture and art into courses like English, History and Russian? All that has to be integrated so a student comes out with a huge perspective of the world, not just confined to a single country, which is exactly what [Merrill] recognizes,” continued Neissa.\n Merrill’s path to becoming an instructor at Andover started when he was a Junior at Phillips Exeter Academy. His best friend’s father, former Dean of Faculty at Exeter, convinced him to take Russian.\n Merrill went on to earn a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Russian Language and Literature from the University of Pennsylvania, a Master’s degree in Linguistics and a PhD in Slavic Languages from UCLA.\n Merrill taught at the University of Maryland for seven years before coming to Andover after being denied tenure. \n “In retrospect, it was possibly the best thing that could’ve happened to me. This decision pushed me out of the college environment and into an environment where teaching was more interesting than at the college level, my colleagues here are a lot better to work with. It’s just been a better environment to work in,” said Merrill.\n Merrill said that the work he does for ACTR is different from what he and other teachers do at Andover \n “The kinds of things I do [at ACTR] would be even harder if I didn’t have interesting colleagues and interesting students to go back to and try things out with and talk things over with. The context in which people work has a large influence on how they are able to work beyond the immediate needs of the job, and Andover has been a pretty good place for that to happen,” said Merrill.\n Merrill has also received the 1995 “Excellence in Teaching at the Secondary Level” award from the American Association of Slavic and East European Languages.\n Merrill has spoken at numerous conferences, including one last year that hosted over 50 schools from around the world.\n At Andover, Merrill is a house counselor in Fuess, manages the instructional fencing program and coordinates the Global Perspectives group, where he oversees and helps coordinate some of the school’s global initiatives.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nThe “Save Our Flag” Green Cup Challenge competition between Andover, the Lawrenceville School and Deerfield Academy concluded this past Wednesday. The competition collected data comparing energy consumption of both newly renovated “green” dorms as well as older dorms across campus. \n The final results of the competition between the three schools are not yet available because Lucid, the company that manages the national Green Cup Challenge and the “Save Our Flag” competition, is experiencing technical difficulties, according to Trish Russell, Director of Sustainability. \n Preliminary results, however, suggested that Andover placed second in the interschool challenge behind Lawrenceville, and Carriage House won the campus challenge. These results are not final, according to Rebecca Hession, faculty coordinator of the Green Cup Challenge. \n Out of Abbot Stevens House and Fuess House, the two dorms renovated in the past year to become more eco-friendly, only Fuess reduced its electricity consumption since last winter. Stevens, on the other hand, increased its electricity consumption by 39.6 percent. \n One reason for Stevens’ poor performance in the Green Cup Challenge could be that the goals of the renovation was not strictly for the purpose of saving energy, wrote Elizabeth Davis, Senior Capital Project Manager, in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “While the primary goal of the Stevens renovation was to address deferred and cycle maintenance issues within the dormitory areas, we did consider energy savings where the opportunity existed,” wrote Davis. \n The most noticeable renovation in Stevens was the 30-second shower timer, which automatically switches off the shower after 30 seconds. Other improvements include new energy-efficient lighting, improved insulation, water-conserving toilets and LED-lit exit signs, according to Davis. \n Fuess, on the other hand, was renovated for the purpose of reducing energy usage, and new energy-efficient LED lighting and occupancy sensors were installed over Winter Break, according to a previous article in The Phillipian.\n Stevens currently ranks 25th out of the 26 dorms participating in the school-wide competition, according to Gunga Data. The competition only measures electricity consumption, not heat or water consumption, according to a previous article in The Phillipian. So other major renovations in Stevens may not have been accounted for in the competition. Fuess has saved more than 36 percent more electricity from last year, according to Gunga Data. \n Since the beginning of the year, Stevens has produced around 18,518 pounds of CO2. Fuess has released approximately 11,177 pounds of CO2 since the beginning of January, according to Gunga Data. However, Stevens has spent $2,888 on energy since the beginning of the year, while Fuess has spent $12,747, according to Gunga Data. \n Stevens and Fuess House, both located in Pine Knoll, were the only two dorms to undergo major renovations in the past year. Stevens was renovated over the summer, while Fuess was partially renovated in the winter. The renovations will be finished over Spring Break, according to a previous article in The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nSocioeconomic class does not just affect how individuals act in social situations, but also influences everything from their preparedness for standardized testing to their eloquence, according to Angela Leocata ’13. \n Leocata presented her CAMD Scholar project “The American Reality: The Effect of Socioeconomic Class on The Educational Process” on Friday, discussing the extent to which wealth determines the path of students’ schooling. \n Low-income children are half as likely to visit museums, theaters and other cultural places. They are also provided with less child care, less educational readiness for higher institutions and grow up to speak differently than children of higher classes, according to Leocata. \n Leocata conducted her research over the summer by interviewing educators and current Andover students. She discussed with members of the community how they thought wealth personally affected students at Andover.\n “Institutions that practice the need-blind admissions policy admit students without regards to their financial backgrounds. The policy has actually transformed elite education into a merit-based system. Many educators believe that it has acted as a distractor to the ongoing inequality,” said Leocata.\n “Class is influenced not solely by economic capital, what you earn or own, but also social capital, who you know, and cultural capital, what you know,” she continued. \n In addition to its effect on Andover’s community, disparity in socioeconomic class is evident after high school, according to Leocata. Lower economic status in college can lower student’s confidence and lead to classism, prejudice against others based upon distinctions in social class.\n “Whether or not [a student’s] parents received college degrees is the most clear indicator of whether they will attend college. Often, high school and college students from a working class family are given less educational opportunities and as a result, hide their class identity,” said Leocata.\n Furthermore, Leocata said that the difference between a low-income student’s home community and their educational community can create a division between students and their parents.\n “Often in working class families, there is a gap between the cultural capitals of the children and their parents. Due to their parent’s lack of experience, students are sometimes embarrassed by the presence of their parents and look at them in a different lens,” said Leocata.\n Leocata further explored the experience of socioeconomic identity in the context of the Andover community. She interviewed several Andover students who were on full scholarship. \n “Hearing the voices of Andover students who are currently on financial aid was the most powerful and interesting part of my presentation,” said Leocata in an interview with The Phillipian. \n According to her presentation, 47 percent of Andover’s student body currently receives some portion of financial aid.The percentage of students on full scholarship at Andover varies from 11-15 percent by grade level, according to Leocata.\n To discover the social impact of economic status at Andover, Leocata conducted a survey of Andover students. The survey yielded that 64.3 percent of the students on financial aid felt their socioeconomic statuses had affected their academic life, 70.4 percent felt it affected their social life and 53.6 percent of students felt that because of their socioeconomic status they were at a disadvantage in the college process.\n “Socioeconomic class is embedded in us all. It is an essential part of our identity that we carry with us throughout our lives. It shapes our development, affects where we are educated, and measures our chances of achieving. For some, socioeconomic class is an identity that has been carried lightly. But for others, it has been a constant reminder of where they have been, what they have seen and where they want to progress,” said Leocata.\n Following Leocata’s presentation, Dr. Ricardo Dobles ’85 offered Leocata comments on her presentation and fielded audience questions.\n Dobles discussed the issue of socioeconomic identity in the education system in his own narrative and continued to discuss the educational barriers that children face due to class identity.\n Mr. Lou Bernieri, Instructor in English, served as Leocata’s CAMD scholar advisor.\n “Although I am on a sabbatical right now, I still decided to help Angela with her project because I loved her research topic. Coming from a working-class family, I was very well aware of this issue and was very glad when Angela brought it up,” he said.\n Leocata’s presentation was the fifth and final CAMD Scholar presentation this year.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nAfter being told that finding the determinant of a four-by-four matrix was so complicated that it should be solved with a computer algorithm, Abhinav Venigalla ’15 discovered a simpler method to find the determinant last Winter Term while in Math 380, accelerated Precalculus.\n Venigalla’s solution is now published in the “Reader Response” section of February’s “Mathematics Teacher,” an academic journal that publishes research in the field of mathematics education.\n A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns. The determinant of a matrix is a mathematical expression that “determines” whether the matrix can be inversed.\n The method for finding the inverse of a four-by-four matrix is extremely complicated, according to Patrick Farrell, Chair and Instructor in Math. Farrell told Venigalla’s math class that although they should know how to find the determinant of a four-by-four matrix, they would typically use a calculator or computer to solve it. \n After learning about four-by-four matrices in class, Venigalla decided to experiment with finding a new way to find their determinants. \n “Mr. Farrell showed us a shortcut to find the determinant of a three-by-three matrix, so I thought there must be a shortcut for the four-by-four as well. So, after class, I tried to find it,” Venigalla said.\n “When I solved it, I was kind of surprised. I thought it would be something more complicated, but it actually turned out kind of nice,” Venigalla said.\n Venigalla only knew he had found something new when he showed his method to Farrell the next day in class, and Farrell had never seen it before. Farrell urged him to send a letter to the “Reader Response” section of “Mathematics Teacher.”\n “I’ve been looking at “Mathematics Teacher” for many, many years, and so whenever I see something that a student has done that’s really interesting, I encourage them to send it into the ‘Reader Reflections,’” Farrell said.\n Venigalla re-factored the original expression for the four-by-four matrix to find that it was just six groups of two-by-two matrices. “Using some factoring, however, we can simplify this formula even further to a series of just six products involving determinants of two-by-two matrices within the four-by-four matrix,” reads Venigalla’s letter in the journal. \n Farrell helped Venigalla draft the letter to accompany his solution for the journal, but Venigalla created the solution on his own.\n Venigalla sent his letter to the journal on January 14, 2012, but the article was not printed until this month because the editors of the magazine had to ensure this method had not been done previously.\n “It would be pretty pointless to publish a letter if it was a method that a bunch of people had done before,” said Farrell. \n “Mathematics Teacher” informed Venigalla and Farrell in August that the letter would be published in the February edition.\n Venigalla, who placed in Math 380 as a Junior, has always had a special curiosity for math.\n “To be able to look at something that mathematicians have been doing for over a hundred years and be able to play around with it and see something fall out that, as far as I know, no other mathematician has done before, that’s really special,” said Farrell.\n “I think that Andover’s math program is really challenging, especially with Majors [long-term group math projects]. It makes you think more, like not just to ‘rinse and repeat’ the problems, but to think more,” said Venigalla.\n Venigalla’s talents in math were evident even in middle school. In eighth grade, Venigalla was featured on CNN for getting a 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT in seventh grade, including a 790 out of 800 on the Math portion. \n Additionally, Venigalla earned perfect scores on Florida’s Comprehensive Assessment Test two years in a row and has won both a national math competition and a robotics competition. He surpassed the math offerings at his previous magnet school and began taking online courses, according to the CNN article about Venigalla’s success on the SAT.\n “Mathematics Teacher,” the journal in which Venigalla’s work was published, is a publication of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

Instead of one School President, there will be two School Co-Presidents beginning this election cycle. One major change to the election process with the Co-President model will be that the two final candidate pairs will debate during an All School Meeting, instead of the top three candidates making speeches as they have in the past, according to Paul Murphy, Dean of Students.\n The new process is not yet finalized, according to Hemang Kaul ’13, current School President. The Student Council Review Committee met on Wednesday to discuss plans for the debate. Members of the current Executive Board, Kaul, Rolando Bonachea ’13, Vice President of Student Council, and MJ Engel ’13, Executive Secretary of Student Council, will direct the discussion as moderators.\n “The debate is something that is new, and it will help showcase skills that are pertinent to the Co-President job description,” said Engel.\n Aside from the change to Co-Presidents and the introduction of the debate, no other changes have been made to the election process. \n Campaign guidelines will remain the same as those in last year’s election cycle. These include a $50 maximum budget, a maximum poster size of 11 by 17 inches and one-minute videos to be produced in the Polk-Lillard Center.\n “Two years ago we had an election that felt very chaotic and not very positive, so last year’s board and myself and Dr. Cernota, who was the faculty advisor to Student Council at the time, sat down and hammered out what we thought would be good guidelines for everyone to follow,” said Murphy.\n The reactions to the Co-President model have been positive thus far.\n “The benefit of Co-Presidents is that [the presidency] is a very big job, and there is enough for two people to do. In my view, two are better than one. I think it will allow there to be some accountability. If you have two people that are supposed to get things done, it seems more likely that it will actually get done,” said Murphy. \n Engel said, “I believe the Co-Presidential model gave the opportunity to a lot more people who might not have thought about running beforehand a chance to run. So far they have shown great respect and great competitive spirit so far in the campaign. They have remained respectful of their opponents; they have remained respectful of the process in general, and I think that is going to be a great election season.”\n Bonachea said, “I think the Co-President model definitely makes it easier because you can disperse the work of both the campaign and actually being President between two people.”\n The Co-President model has affected the candidate pairs differently. Candidates elaborated on how they hope to use the new structure to the advantage of student council.\n “By working together we can reach more people and make a bigger difference. Jake and I come from very different educational backgrounds. Jake will be a four-year senior, and I was a repeat new lower, so together we have had different experiences. We can take these experiences that we’ve both had and blend them to create the best Andover possible,” said Gallagher.\n “The Co-President model fosters cooperation. It fosters a more “non-sibi” and less arrogant spirit in those seeking office. Most of all, it creates more than one figure who stands for the school, allowing for a more accurate embodiment and better representation of the student body,” wrote Peale in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “There is half as much responsibility and work to complete for each member. It is also very convenient to have a companion to discuss platform ideas and the next initiatives the team should take. Clint and I work very well together and have been able to derive unique ideas working together. The process also involves mental stress and having a teammate makes it less solitary and isolable,” wrote Simard-Halm in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “Getting to know each other is actually the basis of Dan’s and my platform. We want to make the school feel like a family rather than always a pressure-cooker, and I think the Co-President model enhances that message and makes that goal a little more attainable,” said Lippey.\n The new structure also affected the candidates’ decision to run for Co-Presidents.\n “I would have been much less likely to run on my own, but having Co-Presidents definitely encourages more pairs to run. I think the decision to have Co-Presidents is an interesting one, especially in light of the election last year and John Palfrey’s theme of connected learning this year. I see Co-Presidents as encouraging the spirit of collaboration on campus, reaching an even broader net of students, and getting even more accomplished,” wrote Murree in an e-mail to The Phillipian. \n “[Clark and I] were both planning to run for the presidency before the Co-President model was even considered. However, seeing as we had both worked together as Lower reps and knew we could collaborate with each other, we mutually decided that running together would kill two birds with one stone. Quite a few of our campaign ideas were quite similar, so it has been easy to mesh them,” wrote Onome in an e-mail to The Phillipian.\n\n', 'Feb 21, 2013'), ('\nAfter discussion amongst faculty and with Student Council in the fall, the academic calendar for the 2013-2014 school year was finalized on Tuesday under the new system of equal term lengths. Next year, each term will be 11 weeks long, including Extended Period Week at the end of each term. Other changes include moving Wellness Week to the last week of January during Winter Term, as opposed to having it during Fall Term. “With a shorter Fall Term, there was a feeling that having something like Wellness Week to disrupt the adjustment in the first term at Andover for a lot of students didn’t seem [like] the best idea,” said John Rogers, Dean of Studies. Under the new calendar model, Parents Weekend falls on the same weekend as the PSAT test every other year, which includes the 2013-2014 school year.

Compared to the 2012-2013 calendar, next year’s Thanksgiving Break is two days longer, while Winter Break is one week shorter. However, Winter Break for the 2012-2013 school year was unusually long due to the date of Thanksgiving. Under the new schedule, Winter Break will vary between 18-25 days, which will only be about two days shorter on average compared to Winter Break under the previous calendar model, according to Rogers. With Winter Break in the middle of Winter Term, the Academic Council is working to produce clear guidelines for faculty regarding the amount of work that can be assigned over break. This will ensure that students are not overwhelmed by assignments over the holiday season, said Rogers.

Friday nights are also a time when students do not have clubs or practices to attend.\n Hoenig said that the trial period will allow the Administration to test the effectiveness of this system.\n\n', 'Feb 16, 2013'), ('\nRegular Andover PostSecret updates resumed on Thursday, after a five-day suspension initiated by student founders, Devon Burger ’13, Lily Scherlis ’13 and Erin Wong ’13, after faculty and administrators raised concerns about student anonymity on the website. \n Burger, Scherlis and Wong started Andover PostSecret as a project for Abbot Global Seminar’s “Healthy Community” assignment, which aims to establish a community organization to aid a specific group of people, according to Burger. Modeled on the official PostSecret project, Andover PostSecret uploads self-created cards containing “secrets” submitted anonymously by community members to its Tumblr page, andoverpostsecret.tumblr.com. \n Burger wanted to focus her Healthy Community project on suicide prevention, an issue she has always been interested in. With Scherlis and Wong, they hoped that PostSecret would unify students by allowing them to submit secrets anonymously and revealing the shared issues in the Andover Community. \n “I think that at Andover, a lot of things are really unspoken. There’s this pressure to be perfect in all aspects of life, and I really hope students see that if they feel unhappy, they’re not the only ones,” said Burger.\n “It’s easiest to really take an interest in things that hit close to home. After having been at Andover for three years, I knew what it was like to feel obligated to meet Andover’s high standards. I think PostSecret is a really good way of combating that,” said Scherlis.\n The website is not directly affiliated with Abbot Global Seminar or the school, but the students will discuss the information gathered in their project with the class, according to Scherlis.\n When PostSecret was first launched on January 30, it quickly attracted faculty attention as many postcards mentioned delicate themes like suicide, depression, and drug abuse. \n Eleven days after its launch, the students suspended the website because Seth Bardo, Elizabeth Tully and Diane Moore, Instructors of Abbot Global Seminar, were concerned about the anonymous nature of the website, according to Scherlis. \n “Their main concern was that PostSecret on a large, international scale is very different than in a small community. You don’t need to worry about someone recognizing your handwriting, artwork, or content, but it’s not the same within Andover,” said Scherlis.\n After five days of discussion between Paul Murphy, Dean of Students, and the faculty members, the instructors told the founders that they could resume publishing secrets on the website with a disclaimer to make viewers and submitters aware that they may still be inadvertently identified, according to Scherlis. \n The website was relaunched on Thursday morning with a disclaimer at the top of the Andover PostSecret homepage, which reads, “The original PostSecret runs on an assumption of anonymity that is possible due to the global scale of the organization. Because Andover is a smaller, more contained environment, that same anonymity may be compromised due to distinctive handwriting, artistic style, or content.”\n Andover PostSecret retains the right to moderate submissions in cases which could constitute as harassment, any that directly identifies students or groups, or those that the founders believe could be seriously harmful, according to the website. \n Psychologists at Graham House believe that PostSecret may not be the healthiest approach for these topics, since posting secrets, worries, and fears anonymously online doesn’t solve any of the underlying problems that are present, said Carol Israel, Assistant Director of Psychological Services at Andover.\n “It’s one thing to feel that you’re not alone…but that’s not enough to make someone feel better,” said Israel.\n Israel said she was worried that the website could devolve into a forum that only made depressed students unhappier. She cited the existence of “pro-anorexia” websites, where submitters encourage each other to continue their eating disorders. \n “[Pro-anorexia websites] might have started as, it’s nice to know other people are struggling with eating disorders, but they quickly devolved into ways to be more anorexic, ways to hide from people who are trying to help you, ways to sneakily continue your dangerous behavior. They quickly turn into support groups for dangerous behavior,” said Israel. \n After consulting Graham House counselors, the founders decided to put links to the Suicide Prevention Wikipedia, which has information and phone numbers of help hotlines in each state. Additionally, there is a list of support systems at Andover detailed on the front page, which includes Graham House, Isham, and an explanation of the Sanctuary Policy.\n Members of the administration also considered how the content of the website would affect the prospective applicants, according to Olivia Bren, Cluster President in Pine Knoll. \n Recognizing that PostSecret could potentially discourage prospective students from applying to or matriculating at Andover, the founders put Google Analytics on the website, which will allow them to keep track of its popularity. One of their main concerns is the possibility of PostSecret appearing before the official Andover website in a Google search for “Andover,” said Burger. \n “If it starts to have so much of an impact on the school’s reputation that it’s posing significant problems for admissions, we’re absolutely in support of taking it down,” said Scherlis.\n During its suspension, several alumni and students have expressed their support for the website by contacting the founders and even Head of School John Palfrey, according to Scherlis. She said that some alumni said that the secrets would have been very similar had PostSecret been at Andover when they were at school. \n “I never guessed that school-wide, people would be excited about it. I didn’t even expect the guys of the school to get involved. It hit a lot of demographics that surprised me,” said Wong.\n “Our biggest fear was people not wanting to get involved, but the outpouring of support has been incredible. People really want this connection with other people. They want the community that they feel they might be missing out on. I feel like it’s almost brought people together in a way. Everyone’s looking for the same thing,” said Burger.\n Though Abbot Global Seminar is a term-contained course, the founders hope to continue updating the website through the Spring.\n “It’s something where I don’t want to drag it out for its own sake. It’s important so long as the community feels it’s important. As soon it’s something that we’re perpetuating for its own sake, it’s not worth doing anymore,” said Scherlis.\n The worldwide PostSecret initiative was started by a man named Frank Warren in 2005, who distributed postcards around the United States for people to write their secrets on. The movement was designed to provide a sense of unity and community through the anonymous postcards, and various universities around the country have established PostSecrets of their own.\n Correction: February 15, 2013\n An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that administrators and faculty members suspended PostSecret. The three student founders, Burger, Scherlis and Wong, chose to suspend the site of their own volition after the faculty and administration raised concerns.\n\n', 'Feb 14, 2013'), ('\nIn an effort to provide Andover students with comprehensive health care under one roof, the Board of Trustees decided last week to proceed with the preliminary design phase of a new Wellness Center.\n The new center will offer medical care, counseling services, health education, physical therapy and rehabilitation, according to Larry Muench, Director Facilities. \n The construction of the new Wellness Center is expected to begin in June 2014 and conclude in August 2015. The architect-selection process, which is currently underway, will finish in May. The building-design phase has yet to begin and is expected to take one year immediately following architect-selection.\n Discussions about a new Wellness Center have been ongoing for several years are have been based on internal and external evaluations that were conducted by the school, according to Amy Patel, Medical Director and School Physician.\n “Over the last several years there has been increasing collaboration between the different facets of health, so we are not coming up with something that is revolutionary—it has been in the works for many years,” said Patel.\n Located on Salem Street between Benner House and Bulfinch Hall, the new center will be more accessible to the community in terms of location and condensation of services. It will have an intelligent design that factors in the natural terrain and also keeps the lines of sight to and from Bulfinch Hall, said Muench.\n “We have realized [that] as a community, students do not have the time to get from place to place or even seek the care that they need to take care of themselves when they are sick,” said Patel. \n Patel plans to develop a new, more comprehensive health and wellness education program in the coming years as well, building off the current Physical Education and Personal and Community Education (PACE) programs.\n “In the wellness program, we hope to enhance health and wellness education. You can google anything, but you will not always get the correct answer. I think it is my job, and the job of other healthcare professionals as well, to show students where to get validated information from,” said Patel.\n “The goal is to be proactive and not reactive to health problems. We are hoping that this new wellness initiative will encourage students to be more proactive,” added Patel. \n The new center will also allow for increased collaboration between various wellness teams, according to Patel.\n “To combine the physiological services and medical services in one building is what we have wanted for a long time. The idea that a student can come to one building, centrally located, and get all their health needs taken care of is something to be excited about. And for the adults, we are looking forward to working together,” said Carol Israel, Associate Director of Counseling.\n Patel added, “There is something powerful about the synergy that is created when multiple components of health come together. So, for example, when students are stressed, it is important to recognize that there are overlapping physical and psychological manifestations. Housing both medical and psychological services in the same building would enhance coordination of services and improve care delivery.” \n Israel does not anticipate any changes in the counseling process, although the location of the building will most likely increase the number of visitors. \n Israel said, “I think that being in the health center will help to fix the stigmas associated with Graham House. I think having the counseling services contained within a health center where kids are having a PACE class, seeing a nutritionist or doing some functional rehab with a trainer will make it easier for kids to feel comfortable in counseling sessions.”\n A project team made up of members from the Office of the Physical Plant (OPP), the Senior Administrative Council (SAC), medical specialists, counseling specialists, outside specialists and trustees is currently being assembled to select the architect for this project, said Muench.\n With an anticipated cost of several million dollars, the building will most likely be two stories high and accessible from both Salem Street and Highland Road. According to Muench, the funds have yet to be raised.\n\n', 'Feb 14, 2013'), ('\nThe Shuman Admissions Office began reading applications online this year for the first time ever, reducing the application processing time to a quarter of what it was before. \n Because of the more efficient system, Jim Ventre, Dean of Admissions and Director of Financial Aid, and the Admissions office decided last July to push back the deadline for boarding applications from January 15 to February 1. \n The Admissions Office plans to use SharePoint, an online reading system where readers can access files simultaneously. Because every application is read by two faculty readers, the interviewer, a class officer and a dean, it had previously taken three to five days to circulate one application folder among all five readers, according to Ventre. \n “Since multiple readers have access to the same application at the same time, the decision-making timeline has streamlined the entire evaluation and decision processes, saving time and resources while making reader participation easier and more convenient,” said Ventre. \n “It’s created a new level of access and convenience for our faculty readers that they didn’t have before,” he added. \n Prior to this year, each application was printed and put into individual folders. Faculty readers would come into the admissions office and select a group of folders from a specific grade to read. They would then read, evaluate and vote on the folders and write a paragraph about each student. \n With the new system, each member of the faculty is assigned a few applicants whose files they will be able to access with their personal login, according to Ventre. Although faculty can now read the entire application online, feedback from the evaluators is still submitted on paper to the Admissions office with the exception of the Music Department. Peter Cirelli, Instructor and Chair in Music, has introduced an online music assessment system for those candidates who submit recordings with their applications. \n Depending on the success of the music assessment system, an online candidate evaluation system may be implemented next year. The goal is to move the entire process, including feedbacks, online eventually, according to Ventre. \n However, the Admissions Office also plans to retain the human component of the application, Ventre said. \n “We will never do away with the human oversight of the assessment of the candidates. The idea is that we can actually open up and invite more participation of our faculty into the reading process because we have made the assessment easier and more convenient for them. We can actually expand the input of the faculty to evaluate the candidates that the faculty believes deserve the opportunity to come to Andover,” he said.\n In addition to improving convenience, the new online system eliminates paper waste and the risk of losing documents in the admissions process. \n Andover is the first of its peer schools to manage the entire application process online, Ventre said. He continued that Andover is very different than many schools because of the large faculty input in the evaluation process. \n “Everyone has been really positive about [the new system]. We are considering this as version 1.0, and we are looking forward to next year when we will have version 2.0,” said Ventre.\n According to Ventre, the Admissions Office began moving the application process online five years ago with the implementation of CollegeNET, a program that enables candidates to submit all the pieces of the application online with the exception of the essays. \n For the 2009-2010 application season, Andover introduced the Gateway Application, which is now used to submit the entire Andover application electronically. \n The Admissions office collaborated with the Andover Information Technology Department, specifically John Wilson, Associate Director of Technology, and Dominic Veneto, Director of Information Technology, on this project.\n\n', 'Feb 14, 2013'), ('\nUntil he left for Black Forest Academy in Southwestern Germany, Scott Sutton spent his youth playing with monkeys and elephants under the mango trees in Darfur, Sudan, where his parents worked as missionary doctors. \n Sutton, a human rights activist, shared his personal stories about growing up in Darfur, talked about the past and present genocidal conditions in the region and spoke about the development of South Sudan.\n In 2003, a struggle for economic authority over the region sparked a genocide. \n “The war was extremely bloody. There was a conflict between the North and the South Sudan for more economic control. Eventually the South Sudan gained its independence, but the war had already done too much harm,” said Sutton.\n Sutton explained the effects of the genocide, which claimed 400,000 lives, displaced 2.5 million and left four million people hungry. The people of Darfur were subjected to constant threats of rape, assault and death, and 90 percent of Darfur’s villages were destroyed.\n “It may be easy to say that the result of the crisis was the government’s fault and was caused by the difference of opinions between nomads and farmers, and Black Africans and Arab-Africans. But the reality is that history is rarely that simple,” said Sutton. \n Sutton emphasized the importance of humanitarian aid in the Sudanese conflict. The Sudanese government, however, has opposed both international intervention and help from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) numerous times in the past. \n “My father, as a missionary doctor, provided direct medical care for the children and adults in Darfur during this time. Soon, there was a strong international reaction and attention from the media, attracting figures like George Clooney,” he added.\n According to Sutton, Darfur eventually gained support from organizations such as the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). \n Sutton encouraged students to stay active and continue to make positive changes in the Darfur community.\n “Hopefully in the long run we can make structural changes [in Darfur] to prevent future atrocities, remain in good national anti-genocide constituency and organize a genocide prevention task-force,” said Sutton.\n “Bottom line, I want to tell you today that this issue is real, and it is current. Students in Africa matter just as much as you. In order to improve the current conditions in Darfur, your generation is the first and the greatest test.” he added.\n Sutton hopes that students can understand that everyone deserves equal treatment, and that they should use their skills to help improve issues in the world, rather than to pursue personal gains.\n “Too often in America its easy to ignore things going out on elsewhere because we don’t know the people, they’re different from us and it takes too much time to understand. My goal in sharing my personal story is to help bring names and faces to life,” said Sutton in an interview with The Phillipian. \n Sutton’s visit was organized by the Student Anti-Genocide Coalition (STAND) and sponsored by the Abbot Academy Association.\n “A lot of our work centers around the Darfur Crisis; that is the reason why we started the organization. To have someone who is an American who lived in Darfur during peacetime is something incredibly rare. The fact that someone offers a perspective of both critical and personal side is something that really motivated us to bring him here,” said Junius Williams ’14, Director of Education of STAND. \n Sutton is the 2009 Carl Wilkens Fellow with the Genocide Intervention Network, a D.C.-based human rights group focused on preventing crimes against humanity. He was recently recognized for his leadership by the Triangle Business Journal in its 2011 “40 Under 40” Leadership Awards.\n Sutton now lives in Charlotte, NC, where he is an active speaker, sustainability professional and community leader.\n\n', 'Feb 14, 2013'), ('\nDrawing from knowledge of atlases, National Geographic online quizzes and his experiences from last year’s competition, Christopher Russo ’15 placed first in Andover’s 17th Annual GeograBee. \n Russo, representing Abbot Cluster, earned 24 points out of a possible 90 to win the competition. Jong Ho Park ’16, representing West Quad North Cluster, placed second with 14 points. Miguel Wise ’14, representing West Quad South Cluster, earned eight points to come in third place. \n Cash prizes were awarded to the top three finalists. Russo won $100, Park won $50 and Wise won $25.\n Jason Canavan ’14, representing the day students, David Crane ’13, representing Flagstaff Cluster and Harry Wright ’13, representing Pine Knoll Cluster placed fourth, fifth and sixth respectively.\n The finals took place in Upper Left of Paresky Commons on Tuesday. Canavan qualified for the school-wide finals by winning the day student competition, and the other participants qualified by winning both their dorm and cluster competitions. \n In the school-wide finals, a moderator posed a question, and the first competitor to hit their buzzer responded. Three points were added to a player’s score if they answered the question correctly, and one point was deducted if their answer was incorrect. The competition consisted of a total of 30 questions and 90 possible points.\n Twenty-five questions into the contest, Russo’s score was double that of the second place competitor. Russo frequently buzzed in to answer questions before the moderator finished speaking. \n “I knew how to play the game. The game is all about buzzing in at the right time. I did not know this last year, but now that I knew, I was able to take advantage of it,” said Russo.\n The most difficult questions were the ones that asked for specific details about the demographics, topography and specific industries of a foreign country, according to Crane.\n “I was confused whenever questions relevant to statistics and specific names came up. I think most of us were smart in naming cities and countries, as well as their whereabouts, but the most difficult ones were those consisting of numbers and details,” said Crane.\n On a question about a specific industry in Argentina, four contestants buzzed with different answers, and none of them were able to answer the question correctly.\n This was the first competition in two years where no female finalists made it to the finals.\n “It was interesting to see that the finalists consisted of six boys only. In the future, I hope to see more female candidates for the All-School Geograbee,” said Susanne Torabi, GeograBee and International Student Coordinator.\n Torabi wrote the questions for this year’s competition. Many of her questions were based on information from the National Geographic website. To prepare for the competition, she suggested that student contestants take a daily 10 question quiz on the website. \n “I don’t hide my sources from students. Everyone can choose to learn more about geography throughout the year by taking the quiz and coming back stronger for next year’s GeograBee,” she said.\n The purpose of holding the annual GeograBee is to give students the opportunity to learn more about different regions, peoples and cultures and to promote the student body’s interest in world geography and history, according to Torabi.\n “The world has become so small now and there are so many places we don’t know about. It should be a daily endeavor [to think] about other people and places, and to go outside of the comfort zone,” said Torabi. \n Forty-two dormitories will receive pizza munches for their “perfect” participation in this year’s Geograbee contest. In order to qualify for the munch, all students in the dorm had to participate in and the average of their scores had to be higher than 50 percent in the initial round.\n\n', 'Feb 14, 2013')]
